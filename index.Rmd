## Course description

This course will cover foundations and applications of natural language processing. Problem sets and class projects will leverage common and emerging text-based data sources relevant to environmental problems, including but not limited to social media feeds (e.g., Twitter) and text documents (e.g., agency reports), and will build capacity and experience in common tools, including text processing and classification, semantics, and natural language parsing.

## Learning objectives

The goal of EDS 231 (Text and Sentiment Analysis for Environmental Problems) is to expose students to a range of text and sentiment analysis data sources, techniques and tools that can be applied to environmental problems. During this course, students will:

## Course requirements

### Computing

-   Minimum MEDS device requirements (bring to all sessions + charger!)

-   Up-to-date R and RStudio

-   Python version 3.x installed (although most, if not all, work will be done in RStudio)

### Textbook

-   Readings will be drawn from free online ebooks:
    -   [Text Mining with R](https://www.tidytextmining.com/) (TMR)
    -   [Supervised Machine Learning for Text Analysis in R](https://smltar.com/) (SMLTAR)
