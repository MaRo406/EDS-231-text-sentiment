## Course description

This course will cover foundations and applications of natural language processing. Problem sets and class projects will leverage common and emerging text-based data sources relevant to environmental problems and will build capacity and experience in common tools, including text processing and classification, semantics, and natural language parsing**.**

## Learning objectives

The goal of EDS 231 (Text and Sentiment Analysis for Environmental Problems) is to expose students to a range of text and sentiment analysis data sources, techniques and tools that can be applied to environmental problems. During this course, students will:

-   Become familiar with the R packages used in text-as-data applications

-   Conduct and explain each step in the text data collection, analysis, and presentation pipeline

## Course requirements

### Computing

-   Minimum MEDS device requirements (bring to all sessions + charger!)

-   Up-to-date R and RStudio

-   Python version 3.x installed (although most, if not all, work will be done in RStudio)

### Textbook

-   Readings will be drawn from free online ebooks:
    -   [Text Mining with R](https://www.tidytextmining.com/) (TMR)
    -   [Supervised Machine Learning for Text Analysis in R](https://smltar.com/) (SMLTAR)
