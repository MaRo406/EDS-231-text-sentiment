Problem sets and class projects will leverage\ncommon and emerging text-based data sources relevant to environmental\nproblems and will build capacity and experience in common tools,\nincluding text processing and classification, semantics, and natural\nlanguage parsing.\nInstructor\nMateo Robbins (mjrobbins@ucsb.edu)\nOffice: MEDS Group Office\nOffice hours: Monday 1:15pm -2:15pm\nImportant links\nLink\nto full course syllabus\nWeekly course schedule\nLectures: NCEAS classroom\nM 12:00pm -1:15pm  \nW 11:00am - 12:15pm\nLearning objectives\nThe goal of EDS 231 (Text and Sentiment Analysis for Environmental\nProblems) is to expose students to a range of text and sentiment\nanalysis data sources, techniques and tools that can be applied to\nenvironmental problems. During this course, students will:\nBecome familiar with the R packages used in text-as-data\napplications\nConduct and explain each step in the text data collection,\nanalysis, and presentation pipeline\nCourse requirements\nComputing\nMinimum MEDS device requirements (bring to all sessions +\ncharger!)\nUp-to-date R and RStudio\nPython version 3.x installed (although most, if not all, work\nwill be done in RStudio)\nTextbook\nReadings will be drawn from free online ebooks:\nText Mining with R\n(TMR)\nSupervised Machine Learning for Text\nAnalysis in R (SMLTAR)\n\nTopics\nWeek\nSession\nLecture/Demo\nReading\nAssignment\n1\n4/01\nCourse\nIntro and Text Analysis Overview\n\n\n\n4/03\nNYT\nLab - Key\nTMR\n1.0-1.3, Appendix\nA\nLab\n1\n2\n4/08\nSentiment\nAnalysis I\nTMR\n2.0-2.7\nIn-class\ndemo\n\n4/10\nSentiment\nAnalysis I Lab - key\n\nLab\n2\n3\n4/15\nTopic\nAnalysis Lecture\nTMR\n6.0-6.4\n\n\n4/17\nTopic\nAnalysis Lab - key\n\nLab\n3\n4\n4/22\nClassification\nLecture\nSMLTR\n7.1-7.4\nIn-class demo\n\n4/24\nClassification\ndemo cont.\n\nLab\n4\n5\n4/29\nBreak\n\n\n\n5/01\nBreak\n\n\n6\n5/08\nWord\nEmbeddings Lecture\nSMLTR\n5.1-5.7\n\n\n5/10\nWord Embeddings Lab\n\nLab 5\n\n\n\n",
