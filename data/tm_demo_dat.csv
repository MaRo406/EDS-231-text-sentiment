2024-01-12,Deforestation in Brazil's savanna region surges to highest level since 2019,1,"RIO DE JANEIRO — Deforestation surged in Brazil's Cerrado, a vast tropical savanna region, by nearly 45% in 2023 compared to 2022, according to full-December data released Friday by the government's monitoring agency. The National Institute for Space Research reported that 7,852 square kilometers of vegetation had been torn down in the Cerrado biome between January and December 2023, especially in the states of Maranhao, Bahia and Tocantins. This is the highest level since 2019, when the agency recorded its first full year of deforestation in the Cerrado, home to more than 800 species of birds and nearly 200 mammals, according to the Switzerland-based non-profit World Wildlife Fund, or 30% of the nation's total biodiversity. Since taking office a year ago, President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has halved Amazon deforestation, which reached a 15-year high under his predecessor, Jair Bolsonaro. Even though results have been uneven, the leftist leader has promised to promote development in the region that makes sustainable use of its resources. Unlike in the Amazon, most deforestation in the Cerrado occurs on private land and part of it is legal, said Ane Alencar, science director at the Amazon Environmental Research Institute, or IPAM, a Brazilian nonprofit. Since a vast majority of the federal government's operations are in public forested areas, other actions must be taken, she said. In the Cerrado, land owners are allowed to cut down between 65% and 80% of trees on their properties, compared to 20% in the Amazon, which also has a lot more protected areas, such as natural reserves and Indigenous territories. “Many people are saying that the Cerrado is being offered as a sacrifice,” said Alencar, the IPAM science director. “Internationally, the Cerrado is not very well known. If it had a name like the Amazon, we would have more (public) policies that benefit the conservation of the biome.” Some of the most emblematic animals include jaguars, giant armadillos and anteaters, tapirs and maned wolves. The region is also one of Brazil’s major water reserves. The situation in the Cerrado comes in contrast with Lula's vow to end net deforestation by 2030 — two years beyond his current term. Brazil is hiring new personnel for its understaffed environmental agencies and the nation also announced in September that it will provide financial support to municipalities that have most reduced deforestation. The measure, however, only applies to the Amazon region, not the Cerrado."
2024-03-29,France's Macron embraces Brazil's Lula — and the memes poking fun at their 'wedding',2,"RIO DE JANEIRO — If social media is to be believed, French President Emmanuel Macron's trip to Brazil that ended Thursday left him swooning. Pictures showed him and his Brazilian counterpart, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, ambling through the Amazon and posing beneath the soaring canopy in white button-down shirts. Then there they were again, standing close and clasping hands on a boat as Macron looked adoringly at Lula, both leaders' faces lit by a gentle sun. There were hugs and handshakes aplenty; smiles and selfies, too. Lula on Thursday bestowed the highest honor for a non-citizen on Macron, draping a medal around his neck. Brazilian social media gobbled up the bonhomie with gusto, and users posted photos of the duo that many said looked more like a wedding album than a state visit. On the last evening of his trip, Macron joined in. “Some people compared the images of my visit to Brazil with those of a wedding, and I say to them: It was a wedding!” he posted on X along with a photo of himself and Lula photoshopped onto the movie poster from “La La Land” in place of Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone. “France loves Brazil and Brazil loves France!” Lula replied to his post with the flags of their two nations and an emoji of swirling hearts. Their meeting represented something of a rapprochement after relations soured between Macron and Lula's predecessor, far-right President Jair Bolsonaro, as Amazon deforestation surged to a 15-year high on his watch. And during 2023, the first year of his latest presidential term, Lula irked European leaders with claims that both Ukraine and Russia had decided to go to war and that the U.S. and European Union were “stimulating” the fighting. That drew sharp rebukes from both. Macron's absence had also been noticed at the Amazon Summit in the Brazilian city of Belem last year. He instead sent France's ambassador to Brazil, representing its Amazonian territory of French Guiana. Deforestation in Lula’s first year in office fell by about half, to a five-year low. The first day of Macron's visit took him precisely to Belem, which will host the COP30 climate conference in 2025. He and Lula announced a plan to spend 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) in the Amazon, including parts of the rainforest in French Guiana. The next day, they launched a submarine built with French technology at a shipyard outside Rio de Janeiro. It wasn't all roses. Addressing executives in Sao Paulo, Macron criticized the trade deal that Lula is pushing for the EU and South America's Mercosur bloc, saying it is “terrible” and outdated and needs reworking to take climate change into account. Macron has been the most outspoken among European leaders in opposing the trade deal. Lula told reporters Thursday that the proposal as it stands is much more promising. Before Macron's departure, Lula gifted him with five of Brazil's best cheeses, so that “he can tell me what he thought of them,” the Brazilian leader wrote Thursday night on X. Macron, for his part, didn't immediately comment."
2023-12-14,"Brazil’s Congress Weakens Protection of Indigenous Lands, Defying Lula",3,"While Brazil vows to fight climate change, lawmakers approved a law making it harder for Indigenous tribes to block deforestation, overriding a veto by President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. Brazilian officials served up an array of plans and figures at the recent COP28 climate summit in Dubai, presenting itself as a world leader, on track to protect its forests and the people who live there. But on Thursday, Brazil’s Congress approved a law that threatens Indigenous people’s rights to most of the land they inhabit or claim, potentially opening vast territories to deforestation, farming and mining. The new law requires that Indigenous people must provide concrete evidence that they occupied the land they claim on Oct. 5, 1988, when the country’s current Constitution was enacted — a requirement that many of them have little or no hope of meeting. Under the new rule, not only can Indigenous land claims currently going through the legal process be thrown out for lacking such documentation, but established legal protections for Indigenous territories can also be challenged in court and rescinded. “We have watched the entire world at COP28 saying that we need to change the direction the planet is taking,” said the leftist congressman Tarcísio Motta, who voted against the bill, “but congress has just withdrawn the rights from the people who point to the future of the planet.” Studies have repeatedly shown that protected Indigenous territories have helped prevent Amazon deforestation, meaning the forest can better store carbon to fight climate change. In September, Brazil’s Supreme Court ruled against a 1988 cutoff date for Indigenous land claims, but backers of the new law, who include powerful agricultural interests, hope it will change the legal calculus. The Congress passed the legislation last month, but President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva quickly vetoed most of its provisions. Then on Thursday, the House and Senate overrode the president’s veto, with many of his own allies joining his opponents in voting to defy him. Lawmakers also recently passed a measure that environmentalists call the “poison bill,” which relaxes rules on pesticides, and sent it to the president. The Congress “has agreed with the agenda of the agribusiness caucus and of environmental setbacks,” said Marcio Astrini, the executive-secretary of the Climate Observatory, a network of environmental and civil society organizations in Brazil. The law on Indigenous lands is expected to take effect by next week. Legal experts expect it to be challenged in the Supreme Court, and members of Apib, a leading Indigenous rights movement in Brazil, have already prepared a request for the court to review it. Yet it could take months or more for the court to rule on the case, and environmentalists and Indigenous rights activists fear the harm that could be done by then. “We will watch total chaos in jurisprudence and threats to the lives of these vulnerable people who depend on state action and on these territories to survive”, said Beto Marubo, an Indigenous leader and advocate of Indigenous rights from the Javari Valley of the Amazon basin, home to some of the most isolated people in Brazil. Brazil has more than 1.7 million Indigenous people, according to official figures, and more than half live in the Amazon region. But only 20 percent of households with at least one Indigenous person live within designated Indigenous territories. Those who do live in the territories already struggle against illegal forest-clearing for ranching and mining, and live with legal uncertainty, but the rate of deforestation is much lower in the Indigenous territories than elsewhere. Across Brazil, 483 such territories have been granted full legal protection, and 278 others are going through the process to gain protection, according to FUNAI, a government agency. Altogether, they cover more than 1.1 million square kilometers, or about 425,000 square miles, the size of Texas and California combined, almost 14 percent of Brazil’s area. Advocacy groups say that under the new law, more than 90 percent of these lands could have protection lifted, and they have called out the government for undermining Mr. Lula’s environmental agenda, including preservation of the Amazon rainforest. “It is a very contradictory situation for the country to have a policy to cut deforestation, and, on the other hand, have a Congress that fights tirelessly to end the richest instrument we have for protecting the Amazon: the Indigenous lands,” said Mr. Astrini. Indigenous and environmental groups say that tribes with traditional lifestyles can have occupied an area for centuries without having any way to prove it. Some have had only passing contact with the developed world. Congressmen who support the law argue it is needed to give landowners confidence that their land would not be taken from them, which would also create a better business environment for agriculture. “What is happening today, with the overturning of the veto on the ‘time frame bill,’ is admirable because it brings legal certainty to those who own rural properties in Brazil,” said Márcio Bittar, a right-wing senator. But it is the Indigenous whose land has been — and is being — taken from them, their advocates say, and the law ignores their history of dispossession and marginalization. Outside of the government buildings in Brasília on Thursday, at least 100 Indigenous people and their supporters, including the government’s minister of the Indigenous Peoples, Sônia Guajajara, protested the bill as lawmakers inside voted to override the veto. Afterward, they headed to the nearby Supreme Court building to symbolically file their request for review. Flávia Milhorance reported from Rio de Janeiro and Paulo Motoryn from Brasília.

2023-11-11,Deforestation in Brazilian Amazon Falls to a Five-Year Low,4,"Tree loss was down 20 percent from the previous year, the environment minister announced. Deforestation in the Amazon rainforest in Brazil fell to a five-year low, the country's National Institute of Space Research announced on Thursday, a sign that Brazil, which has the biggest share of tropical forest in the world, was making progress on its pledge to halt all deforestation by the end of the decade.   The institute reported that 3,500 square miles had been clear-cut between August 2022 and July 2023, a 22.3 percent decrease from the same period a year earlier. The decline in tree loss is estimated to have reduced the country's greenhouse gas emissions by 7.5 percent. Brazil is the world's sixth largest emitter, by some measures.  ''Behind this was a political decision,'' Marina Silva, Brazil's environment minister, said on Thursday at a news conference. ''We are changing the image of the country when we change this reality.''  The announcement was an encouraging sign that local policies could change the trajectory of global forest loss. The world lost 10.2 million acres of primary forest in 2022, a 10 percent increase from the year before, according to an annual survey by the World Resources Institute. Brazil accounted for more than 40 percent of the destruction recorded.  The results were announced almost a year after President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva took office in January. He said in his October 2022 victory speech that Brazil was ''ready to resume its leading role in the fight against the climate crisis.''  Two-thirds of the deforestation happened before Mr. Lula came into office, the government said. Under his predecessor, Jair Bolsonaro, deforestation rates climbed to a 15-year high as Mr. Bolsonaro's administration loosened environmental protection policies.  Environmental fines in the Amazon more than doubled under Mr. Lula, the government reported, as his administration sought to rebuild the forest's protection policies. Almost all of the deforestation in Brazil's Amazon rainforest is illegal, mostly the result of land grabbing and farmers' replacing trees with pasture.  Brazil isn't the only country making progress in the region. Colombia, which has a tenth of the Amazon rainforest, announced on Tuesday that deforestation rates there had fallen by 70 percent in the first nine months of the year.  But El Niño, the climate pattern that has helped cause a historic drought fueling major wildfires in the region, may jeopardize some of the progress in the region, the environment ministers of both countries acknowledged.  Wildfires have consumed more than 18,000 square miles of the Brazilian Amazon in the first nine months of the year, an area twice the size of Vermont.  More than a third of fires raging in the Brazilian Amazon are destroying old-growth forests, Ms. Silva said.

2023-09-06,"In the battle against Amazon deforestation, Brazil offers cash rewards to municipalities",6,"RIO DE JANEIRO — In a bid to slow deforestation in the Amazon, Brazil announced Tuesday that it will provide financial support to municipalities that have reduced deforestation rates the most. During the country´s Amazon Day, President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva also signed the creation of two Indigenous territories that total 207,000 hectares — over two times the size of New York City — and of a network of conservation areas next to the Yanonami Indigenous Territory to act as a buffer against invaders, mostly illegal gold miners. “The Amazon is in a hurry to survive the devastation caused by those few people who refuse to see the future, who in a few years cut down, burned, and polluted what nature took millennia to create,” Lula said during a ceremony in Brasilia. “The Amazon is in a hurry to continue doing what it has always done, to be essential for life on Earth.” The new program will invest up to $120 million in technical assistance. The money will be allocated based on the municipality´s performance in reducing deforestation and fires, as measured by official satellite monitoring. A list of municipalities eligible for the funds will be published annually. The resources must be invested in land titling, monitoring and control of deforestation and fires, and sustainable production. The money will come from the Amazon Fund, which has received more than $1.2 billion, mostly from Norway, to help pay for sustainable development of the region. In February, the United States committed to a $50 million donation to the initiative. Two months later, President Joe Biden announced he would ask Congress for an additional $500 million, to be disbursed over five years. The most critical municipalities are located along the arc of deforestation, a vast region along the southern part of the Amazon. This region is a stronghold of former far-right President Jair Bolsonaro, who favored agribusiness over forest preservation and lost the reelection last year. “We believe that it’s not enough to just put up a sign saying ‘it’s forbidden to do this or that.

2023-08-08,Brazil is hosting the Amazon nations in a bid to save the world's largest rainforest,8,"Link to Image The eight South American countries that share the Amazon met in Brazil on Tuesday (Aug. 8) to outline a conservation strategy for the sprawling rainforest. The two-day summit, held in the city of Belém, marks the first time the Amazon Cooperation Treaty Organization (ACTO) has gathered in 12 years. The organization's resurgence is tied to the victory of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, known as Lula, in last year's Brazilian presidential election. Returning to office after 13 years, the progressive politician replaced Jair Bolsonaro, who undid decades of progress against deforestation during his four-year term. The ACTO nations-Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Peru, Suriname, and Venezuela-are expected to join Lula's campaign pledge to halt all deforestation in the Amazon by 2030. They will also negotiate reforms aimed at preventing illegal mining and logging in the region. The landmark conference comes at a pivotal time for the Amazon, which climate scientists have warned is approaching a ""point of no return,"" where deforestation would result in the destruction of the biome. The forest is the world's largest carbon sink, storing as much as 733 gigatons of carbon, so it's a major factor in the global fight against climate change. The gathering will also expose rifts between theregion's left-wing leaders. Colombian president Gustavo Petro publicly called on Lula to reject a major oil drilling project near the mouth of the Amazon River, despite the potential for economic development in one of Brazil's poorest areas. In his first stint as president, Lula leveraged resource extraction projects to fund extensive social welfare programs, while still pursuing environmental goals. He has yet to announce his final decision on the oil project. Quotable: A new era in the Amazon ""Brazil is back""-Lula, in a speech to the COP27 climate conference last year, soon after his election win. Now, with the ACTO conference, he's trying to put his plans into action Amazon deforestation, by the digits: 33.6%: Decrease in deforestation across the Amazon during Lula's first six months in office. 17%: Share of the Amazon that has already been cleared by loggers. Almost 40% of the region is suffering from some form of environmental degradation, including for mining and agriculture. 2.72 million square miles (7.04 million square kilometers): Size of the Amazon, making it almost as big as the continental US.

2023-07-07,Deforestation in the Amazon dropped by a third since Lula became president,9,"Link to Image In the first six months of his term, Brazil's president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has somewhat succeeding in curbing the damage his successor Jair Bolsonaro, the so-called Trump of the Tropics, did to the Amazon rainforest. Deforestation in the area dropped by 33.6%, satellite images showed. Data from a system called Deter, which managed by Brazil's National Institute for Space Research, showed that between January and June this year, the rainforest had alerts for possible deforestation covering 2,650 square kilometers (1,023 square miles), down from 4,000 square kilometers during the same period last year under Bolsonaro. ""The effort of reversing the curve of growth has been reached. That is a fact: we reversed the curve; deforestation isn't increasing,"" João Paulo Capobianco, the Environment Ministry's executive secretary, during a presentation. While it appears that Lula is making good on his campaign pledges to rein in illegal logging and undo the environmental crisis, it may be premature to celebrate the win. The dry season, when deforestation tends to jump, starts in June, and fires usually peak between July and November. And the picture for June wasn't promising. Last month, there were 3,075 fires in the Amazon-the most since 2007. But this wasn't the Lula government's doing apparently. The jump is due to clearing of areas deforested in the second half of 2022, Jair Schmitt, head of environmental protection at Ibama, Brazil's federal environmental agency, told The Associated Press. Quotable: Brazil is curbing Amazon deforestation ""Brazil will once again become a global reference in sustainability, tackling climate change, and achieving targets for carbon emission reduction and zero deforestation,"" -Lula in a speech in early June, when his government laid out its plans to halt deforestation in the Amazon by 2030 Amazon deforestation, by the digits 60%: How much of the Amazon rainforest lies in Brazil 40 million: People who live in the Amazon, including over 500 indigenous and ethnic groups 2 billion: Trees felled in the Amazon during Bolsonaro's four years as president.

However, the septuagenarian couldn't run for office in 2018 because of corruption and money laundering convictions the year prior. But these were voided by the Brazilian Supreme Court in 2021. He came back last year with plans of environmental policy overhaul-including tackling illegal logging, aiming for net-zero deforestation, and delivering on emissions targets. He also publicly committed to policies such as introducing carbon pricing and issuing new financial incentives for sustainable farming. Getting Brazil's climate action back on track Brazil is the largest economy, greenhouse gas emitter, and energy consumer in South America, but the impact of its climate action reverberates across the world as the Amazon rainforest is one of the planet's largest carbon sinks. Further deforestation would create dire circumstances comprising worsening air quality, severe drought, loss of biodiversity and extinction of endangered species, rise in respiratory disease, a heightened risk of ""zoonotic spillover"" that would cause more pandemics, and an increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events around the globe. The Lula government is aware of those risks and is taking steps to mitigate the threats. It has strengthened remote surveillance via satellite imagery, the AP reported, citing Schmitt. By cross-referencing land records, owners of deforested areas are identified and sanctioned with restricted access to financial loans and other measures.  The government has doubled deforestation fines and it has also been seizing illegally raised cattle within embargoed areas. It's a form of ""immediate punishment"" instead of relying on a rarely-footed slow-moving fines and appeals process, Schmitt said. But there's one gap left to fill: Lula needs more environmental officers. The Brazilian government's environmental agency, Ibama, had no new hires between 2014 and 2020. Combined with Bolsonaro's trimming of the federal agency headcount, the leftover workforce is sparse and overworked. The number of Ibama's enforcement agents is at its lowest in 24 years. The are just 700 agents, with 150 available for deployment. And beefing up the staff is a long and winding process. The government put out a call for new Ibama hires, but it takes at least 10 months before new agents are in the field, due to rules about public-sector hiring and training for such dangerous missions.

2023-08-09,8 Nations Reach Pact to Protect Amazon Rainforest,10,"The eight countries that comprise the Amazon River basin agreed on several initiatives to curtail deforestation in the world's largest and most important rainforest. On Tuesday, the leaders of eight countries that are home to the Amazon River basin agreed to work together to conserve the world's largest rainforest at a groundbreaking meeting convened by President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva of Brazil.   The agreement, called the Belém Declaration, for the Brazilian city where the meeting was held, provides a road map to stave off the rampant deforestation, caused in large part by industrial agriculture and land-grabbing, that has severely damaged the rainforest and has major implications for Earth's climate.  The meeting was also expected to yield a separate agreement on Wednesday among other nations with major rainforests -- including the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Republic of Congo and Indonesia -- to more closely coordinate protecting the ecosystems globally.  The Amazon rainforest is not only a haven of biodiversity but also plays an important role in the fight against climate change because it pulls huge amounts of planet-warming carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and stores it away. Over the past half-century, around 17 percent of the forest has been razed and an even bigger share is severely degraded.  Numerous studies have indicated that further deforestation would be disastrous to tens of thousands of species and transform the Amazon into a net emitter, rather than absorber, of greenhouse gases. Parts of it have already reached that point.  The summit meeting was part of Mr. Lula's efforts to galvanize a climate-conscious coalition of countries seven months after he unseated Jair Bolsonaro, whose four-year term as president was marked by strident support for Brazil's right to clear vast tracts of land for its economic benefit.  Mr. Lula made Amazon protection a cornerstone of his election campaign. Deforestation rates have dropped by 42 percent during his tenure, according to preliminary satellite imaging data.  ''The Amazon is our passport to a new relationship with the world, a more symmetrical relationship in which our resources will not be exploited for the benefit of a few, but valued and placed at the service of all,'' Mr. Lula said in a speech at the meeting.  The agreement sets the groundwork for coordination between the Amazon basin's eight countries on law enforcement to combat widespread illegal mining and logging, as well as between banks assigned to pool development funds for conservation and sustainable employment for the region's inhabitants. It also creates an Amazon-specific climate-focused scientific panel.  While the agreement projected symbolic unity, it fell short of the biggest ambitions Mr. Lula had hoped to realize.  For months before the summit, Mr. Lula pushed the leaders of Bolivia and Venezuela to commit to ending deforestation in their countries by 2030, a pledge the six other Amazon basin countries had already made at the global climate summit in Glasgow in 2021. Colombia's president, Gustavo Petro, who has adopted the region's most progressive policies on conservation, had in turn pushed Mr. Lula to match his commitment to ban all oil drilling the forest, but Brazil still has plans for a huge offshore project at the mouth of the Amazon River.  Neither push succeeded.  Eduardo Viola, who studies environmental international affairs at the Fundação Getúlio Vargas in Brazil, said there was no doubt the summit marked the most significant step Amazon countries have made to protect the forest, but it may not be enough. ''The commitments vary a lot, and the implementation capacity outside Brazil is low, or very low,'' he said.  The expected announcement on Wednesday of further cooperation among other countries that are home to the most of the rest of the world's rainforests could include efforts to increase access to financing from wealthier nations that would promote sustainable forest use.  The foundation for that agreement was laid last year at COP27, the United Nations-sponsored global climate summit, which was held in Egypt. Belém, the city where this week's Amazon negotiations have taken place, is set to host COP30 in 2025.  The meeting in Belém provided Mr. Lula and others a venue to harshly criticize wealthy countries, particularly Western ones, for not delivering on a promise made in at the U.N. climate summit in 2009 to provide $100 billion in climate finance annually to poorer nations.  Historically, leftists in the region have pushed for more environmental protections. Mr. Lula and Mr. Petro, whose countries are home to nearly three-quarters of the remaining Amazon rainforest, went beyond that and have made conservation a cornerstone of their presidencies.

2023-08-08,"Amazon Countries, Led by Brazil, Sign a Rainforest Pact",11,"The eight countries that comprise the Amazon River basin agreed on several initiatives to curtail deforestation in the world’s largest and most important rainforest. On Tuesday, the leaders of eight countries that are home to the Amazon River basin agreed to work together to conserve the world’s largest rainforest at a groundbreaking meeting convened by President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva of Brazil. The agreement, called the Belém Declaration, for the Brazilian city where the meeting was held, provides a road map to stave off the rampant deforestation, caused in large part by industrial agriculture and land-grabbing, that has severely damaged the rainforest and has major implications for Earth’s climate. The meeting was also expected to yield a separate agreement on Wednesday among other nations with major rainforests — including the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Republic of Congo and Indonesia — to more closely coordinate protecting the ecosystems globally. The Amazon rainforest is not only a haven of biodiversity but also plays an important role in the fight against climate change because it pulls huge amounts of planet-warming carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and stores it away. Over the past half-century, around 17 percent of the forest has been razed and an even bigger share is severely degraded. Numerous studies have indicated that further deforestation would be disastrous to tens of thousands of species and transform the Amazon into a net emitter, rather than absorber, of greenhouse gases. Parts of it have already reached that point. The summit meeting was part of Mr. Lula’s efforts to galvanize a climate-conscious coalition of countries seven months after he unseated Jair Bolsonaro, whose four-year term as president was marked by strident support for Brazil’s right to clear vast tracts of land for its economic benefit. Mr. Lula made Amazon protection a cornerstone of his election campaign. Deforestation rates have dropped by 42 percent during his tenure, according to preliminary satellite imaging data. “The Amazon is our passport to a new relationship with the world, a more symmetrical relationship in which our resources will not be exploited for the benefit of a few, but valued and placed at the service of all,” Mr. Lula said in a speech at the meeting. The agreement sets the groundwork for coordination between the Amazon basin’s eight countries — Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Peru, Suriname and Venezuela — on law enforcement to combat widespread illegal mining and logging, as well as between banks assigned to pool development funds for conservation and sustainable employment for the region’s inhabitants. It also creates an Amazon-specific climate-focused scientific panel. While the agreement projected symbolic unity, it fell short of the biggest ambitions Mr. Lula had hoped to realize. For months before the summit, Mr. Lula pushed the leaders of Bolivia and Venezuela to commit to ending deforestation in their countries by 2030, a pledge the six other Amazon basin countries had already made at the global climate summit in Glasgow in 2021. Colombia’s president, Gustavo Petro, who has adopted the region’s most progressive policies on conservation, had in turn pushed Mr. Lula to match his commitment to ban all oil drilling the forest, but Brazil still has plans for a huge offshore project at the mouth of the Amazon River. Neither push succeeded. Eduardo Viola, who studies environmental international affairs at the Fundação Getúlio Vargas in Brazil, said there was no doubt the summit marked the most significant step Amazon countries have made to protect the forest, but it may not be enough. “The commitments vary a lot, and the implementation capacity outside Brazil is low, or very low,” he said. The expected announcement on Wednesday of further cooperation among other countries that are home to the most of the rest of the world’s rainforests could include efforts to increase access to financing from wealthier nations that would promote sustainable forest use. The foundation for that agreement was laid last year at COP27, the United Nations-sponsored global climate summit, which was held in Egypt.

2024-04-05,Millions of Acres of Forest Vanish in Year,12,"Wildfires and agricultural expansion offset big gains in protecting tropical forests last year. Despite major progress in protecting vast tracts of rainforest, the world failed again last year to significantly slow the pace of global forest destruction, according to a report issued on Thursday. Record wildfires in Canada and expanding agriculture elsewhere offset big gains in forest protection in Brazil and Colombia, the report found.   The annual survey by the World Resources Institute, a research organization, found that the world lost 9.1 million acres of primary tropical forest in 2023, equivalent to an area almost the size of Switzerland, about 9 percent less than the year before. But the improvement failed to put the world on course to halt all forest loss by 2030, a commitment made by 145 nations at a global climate talks in Glasgow in 2021 and reaffirmed by all countries last year.  ''Global leaders sent an undeniable message that forests are critical to meeting global climate goals,'' said Rod Taylor, the global director for forests at the World Resources Institute. But, he added, ''we are far off track and trending in the wrong direction.''  The immense wildfires in Canada last year destroyed such a huge tract of boreal forests, almost three times as much as in any other year, that they turned what would have been a 4 percent decrease in global forest loss into a 24 percent increase over last year.  The report focuses on the tropics because deforestation and fires there are mostly caused by human activity and can create longer-lasting consequences. The humid forests of tropical countries hold a quarter of all carbon stored on land and are home to a large share of animal and plant species, making their protection essential both to curb climate change and to avert biodiversity loss.  Researchers at the World Resources Institute, working in collaboration with the University of Maryland, documented tree loss across the world from deforestation, fires and other causes. Last year's destruction resulted in 2.4 gigatons of carbon dioxide emissions, which is roughly equivalent to half of what the burning of fossil fuels in the United States produces each year.  Still, last year's results showed that progress is possible when forest protection becomes a priority for world leaders. A recent change in leadership in Brazil and Colombia, which together hold almost a third of the world's tropical forests, produced a steep decrease in deforestation rates in the two countries.  Brazil lost 2.8 million acres of forest last year, 36 percent less than in 2022. Ahead of taking office in 2023, President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva said the country was ''ready to resume its leading role in the fight against the climate crisis.'' Brazil, which is home to more than half of the Amazon rainforest, accounted for 30 percent of the tropical forest loss globally last year.  Colombia, where President Gustavo Petro took office in 2022 vowing to protect the rainforest, recorded an even steeper improvement, slashing deforestation rates by 49 percent. Both Brazil and Colombia increased funding for environmental protection, created new programs to develop sustainable economic alternatives for rainforest regions and made efforts to protect local communities who defend forests.  But there are concerns about how permanent those gains will be. In Indonesia, one of the countries that has made the most progress in fighting deforestation over the past decade, tree loss has started ticking up again in the last two years.  ''Ephemeral victories or ephemeral progress in slowing deforestation may not be progress at all,'' said Matthew Hansen, the co-director of a laboratory at the University of Maryland that investigates changes in land use around the world.  But even the gains that researchers documented last year were largely offset by the expansion of agribusiness into tropical ecosystems around the world. The World Resources Institute researchers linked rising deforestation in Bolivia and Laos to the expansion of farms with the goal of increasing exports.  Forest loss in the Congo River Basin, the second-largest tropical forest area in the world, remained persistent last year, as economic hardship continued to drive communities to convert trees into firewood and charcoal for cooking.  Last year, man-made climate change fueled the record-breaking wildfires in Canada and seemed to leave its fingerprints around the world.  In Bolivia, blazes are also growing larger and burning the same areas repeatedly. It's too early to say whether they were fueled by climate change. But the phenomenon has raised questions about whether some heavily degraded areas of the Amazon are transforming into different ecosystems, which some researchers worry could lead to a gradual forest-wide collapse.  Still, there is a lot governments, companies and communities can do to combat forest loss, beyond curbing the carbon emissions that cause climate change, said Mr. Taylor, the World Resources Institute director. New regulations and subsidies for forest protection could help, he said.  Unfortunately, these initiatives aren't happening globally at a significant scale, Mr. Taylor said, ''and that's why we still see deforestation rates persisting.'' https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/04/climate/global-forest-tree-loss-wri.html Graphic   PHOTO: A burned forest in Alberta.

2023-07-06,"In Lula's first six months, Brazil Amazon deforestation dropped 34%, reversing trend under Bolsonaro",14,"RIO DE JANEIRO — After four years of rising destruction in Brazil’s Amazon, deforestation dropped by 33.6% during the first six months of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva’s term, according to government satellite data released Thursday. From January to June the rainforest had alerts for possible deforestation covering 2,650 square kilometers , down from 4,000 square kilometers — an area the size of Rhode Island — during the same period last year under former President Jair Bolsonaro. This year's data includes a 41% plunge in alerts for June, which marks the start of the dry season when deforestation tends to jump. ""The effort of reversing the curve of growth has been reached. That is a fact: we reversed the curve; deforestation isn't increasing,"" João Paulo Capobianco, the Environment Ministry's executive secretary, said during a presentation in Brasilia. Capobianco noted that full-year results will depend on a few challenging months ahead. Still, the data is an encouraging sign for Lula, who campaigned last year with pledges to rein in illegal logging and undo the environmental devastation during Bolsonaro’s term. The former far-right leader weakened environmental authorities while his insistence on development of the Amazon region resonated with landgrabbers and farmers who had long felt maligned by environmental laws. They were emboldened, and Amazon deforestation surged to a 15-year high. Thursday's deforestation data comes from a system called Deter, managed by the National Institute for Space Research, a federal agency. It is an initiative mainly focused on detecting real-time deforestation. The most accurate deforestation calculations come from another system called Prodes, with data released only annually. “Bottom line, we are prioritizing environmental law enforcement,” Jair Schmitt, head of environmental protection at Ibama, Brazil’s federal environmental agency, said in a phone interview with The Associated Press. However, the continued shortage of personnel means the task hasn't been easy, he said. Many Ibama agents retired and weren't replaced during Bolsonaro’s administration, reflecting his effort to defang environmental authorities. Lula has committed to restoring the workforce, but the number of Ibama’s enforcement agents remains at its lowest in 24 years. For the entire country that is bigger than the contiguous U.S., there are just 700 agents, with 150 available for deployment. Ibama has also strengthened remote surveillance, where deforestation is detected through satellite imagery, according to Schmitt. By cross-referencing with land records, it is possible to identify the owner of the area in many cases, leading to an embargo that restricts access to financial loans and imposes other sanctions. Another strategy has been to seize thousands of illegally raised cattle within embargoed areas. It is effective because it inflicts immediate punishment, whereas fines are rarely paid in Brazil due to a slow appeals process, Schmitt said. Rodrigo Agostinho, the head of Ibama, noted in the presentation Thursday that the value of fines imposed in the first half of the year jumped 167% from the 2019-2022 average, and the agency embargoed 2,086 areas — up 111%. “We started the year with a lot of difficulty because of everything we inherited, reorganizing all the enforcement teams, environmental protection, reactivating tech systems,” said Agostinho. Improved deforestation data also reflect the change in rhetoric coming from the top, said Schmitt. Whereas Bolsonaro openly criticized Ibama and advocated for the legalization of deforested areas, Lula has said he will rebuild law enforcement and promised to expel invaders from protected areas. Experts say the mere expectation that a land-grabbed area will eventually be regularized has historically been one of deforestation's biggest drivers. It may be premature to celebrate the reversal in deforestation's trend, however. According to satellite monitoring, there were 3,075 fires in the Amazon in June alone, which marks the beginning of the dry season — the most since 2007. The jump is due to the clearing of areas deforested in the second half of 2022, Schmitt said. In the Amazon, fires are mostly man-made and occur after clear-cutting of the forest. With El Niño looming, which typically brings less rain and higher temperatures to the Amazon, Ibama has doubled its budget for fighting forest fires and increased the scope of its fire squads by 17% for the most critical period, typically July to October. Approximately half of the 2,117 temporary firefighters are Indigenous peoples. The Amazon rainforest covers an area twice the size of India and holds tremendous stores of carbon, serving as a crucial buffer against climate change. Two-thirds of it is located in Brazil. Next month, Lula will preside over a meeting in Belem, bringing together heads-of-state from all Amazonian nations to discuss means to effectively cooperate in the challenging region. Lula has promised to end net deforestation in Brazil's Amazon by 2030. His four-year mandate, his third term, ends two years earlier. To achieve this, law enforcement alone will not be enough, says Adevaldo Dias, a rubber-tapper leader who presides over the Chico Mendes Memorial, a non-profit organization that assists traditional non-Indigenous communities in the Amazon. “It is necessary to invest in sustainable productive chains under community management, such as managed pirarucu (arapaima) fishing, Brazil nuts, vegetable oils, and açai,” he told the AP. “This will help revitalize and expand these chains, generating decent income for those engaged in conservation efforts within their territories.” Ibama's Agostinho also stressed his agency's efforts within Indigenous territories, particularly the land of the Yanomami people where thousands of illegal gold miners — seeking to carve out a living — invaded during Bolsonaro's term. Their activities contaminated waterways and sickened local people, and Lula's government has spent months expelling most of them. Some remain, however, working at night to avoid being caught, Agostinho said. “We are very content with the result so far,"" he said. ""We know the fight isn’t over, we will continue doing this work.” ___ Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

2023-07-08,The presidents of Brazil and Colombia meet to boost cooperation ahead of Amazon summit,15,"RIO DE JANEIRO — Brazil’s President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva on Saturday met with his Colombian counterpart Gustavo Petro to build momentum for an upcoming regional summit on the Amazon rainforest and enhance efforts for its protection. The encounter took place in Colombia’s Leticia, a town in the Amazon’s triple border region between Colombia, Brazil and Peru, where organized crime has recently increased its hold. The meeting aimed to lay groundwork for the Amazon Summit the Brazilian government is organizing in Belem next month. That summit will be attended by leaders of the countries party to the Amazon Cooperation Treaty Organization, made up of Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Peru, Suriname, and Venezuela. Lula is pushing for a joint declaration from the summit, which would be presented at the United Nation’s climate conference, known as COP28, in Dubai in November. ""We will have to demand together that rich countries fulfil their commitments,"" Lula said in Leticia, sitting next to Petro. Petro also stressed the need for a common front to exert pressure on developed countries. “We believed that progress was the destruction of trees. ... Today that is nothing other than the destruction of life,” he said. The Colombian leader said tackling the climate crisis will require spending trillions of dollars. This could be achieved by transforming the global debt system and “trading debt for climate action,” he said. The final document will comprise measures for the sustainable development of the Amazon, protecting the biome, and promoting social inclusion, science, technology and innovation while valuing Indigenous peoples and their knowledge, Brazil’s presidential palace said in a statement. “Joint action of the countries that share the Amazon biome is fundamental for facing the multiple challenges in the region,” the statement said. One challenge faced is the tightened grip of organized crime, particularly in tri-border regions like where Leticia is located. British journalist Dom Phillips and Indigenous activist Bruno Pereira were killed in the neighboring Javari valley region last year. These areas have become “violent hotspots,” according to a report by the UN Office on Drugs and Crime released in June. It noted criminal groups are simultaneously engaged in cocaine production trafficking, as well as natural resource exploitation. Indigenous groups are “disproportionately affected” by the criminal nexus in the Amazon, the report added, pointing to forced displacements, mercury poisoning and other health-related impacts as well as increased exposure to violence. In 2019, Colombia, Bolivia, Ecuador, Brazil, Peru, Guyana and Suriname signed the Leticia Pact to strengthen coordinated actions for the preservation of the natural resources of the Amazon. But the goals are vague and lack ways to measure progress, said Marcio Astrini, executive secretary of the Climate Observatory, an umbrella organization of environmental groups. “It’s a letter of ambitions. We hope that in Leticia they (Lula and Petro) will increase and clarify their ambitions,” said Astrini. Since taking office in January, Lula has strived to put environmental protection and respect for Indigenous peoples’ rights at the heart of his third term. He successful pursued resumption of international donations for the Amazon Fund that combats deforestation, launched a military campaign to eject illegal miners from Yanomami territory, committed to ending all illegal deforestation by 2030 and restarted the demarcation of Indigenous areas. Lula's approach contrasts sharply with the actions of his predecessor, Jair Bolsonaro. Under the far-right leader’s term, deforestation soared to a 15-year high, and environmental restrictions were weakened. Deforestation fell by 33.6% during the first six months of Lula’s term, according to satellite data the Brazilian government released this week from the National Institute for Space Research, a federal agency. Petro has also been vocal about the need to halt destruction in the Amazon. The Colombian leader has proposed the creation of multilateral 20-year financing fund to support farming communities contributing to deforestation. The idea is to compensate them for conservation and regenerative activities instead. Historically, collaboration between Brazil and Colombia, which share a border longer than 1,500 kilometers (about 900 miles), has been lacking, according to Wagner Ribeiro, a geographer and expert in environmental policy from the University of Sao Paulo. “We hope that opportunities for academic cooperation will arise from the meeting, which will later generate public policies that promote environmental conservation,” Ribeiro said. ___ Associated Press writer Gabriela Molina in Quito, Ecuador, contributed to this report."
2023-09-26,"Brazil slows Amazon deforestation, but in Chico Mendes' homeland, it risks being too late",16,"BRASILIA, Brazil — Luzineide Marques da Silva knows the location of each of the 748 rubber trees scattered in her area of the Brazilian Amazon, where she and her family hold rights to tap the trees for latex to sell to a sneaker manufacturer. So she watched in pain and anger last week as two of them were badly damaged by a fire she said was started by one of the land-grabbers encroaching on her territory. “I see the fire engulfing my rubber trees, and I feel as if I myself were being murdered right there,” Silva told The Associated Press in an interview. “He’s burning down the trees from which I earn my livelihood, and I cherish them so much.” After nine months in office, President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has halved Amazon deforestation, which reached a 15-year high under predecessor Jair Bolsonaro, and has promised to promote development that makes sustainable use of its resources. But progress has been uneven, and in the symbolic Chico Mendes Extractive Reserve, it could be too late for scores of rubber-tapper families like Luzineide’s, who are increasingly under siege by illegal cattle ranchers. Extractive reserves are federal conservation units set aside for non-Indigenous forest communities to pursue their traditional lives protected from land-grabbing and deforestation. The areas were created after the international outcry that followed the 1988 assassination of Mendes, a rubber tapper, union leader and environmentalist, on the orders of a local cattle rancher. Despite the land's protected status, cattle trickled into the reserve in the years after it was created, and their numbers exploded during Bolsonaro's four-year rule as the far-right president tried to shrink protected areas and legalize large-scale cattle herds inside extractive reserves. Now Luzineide, who leads a family of 12, including her husband, daughters, and grandsons, fears being killed as Mendes was. Her area, with four rubber tree groves, has become a forested island surrounded by pasture and cattle. She says she has repeatedly received death threats for opposing deforestation. Her situation is not unique. The reserve this year has registered 300 fires, the second-largest figure among conservation units in the Amazon biome, according to official data. Most fires in the rainforest are human-set, either to clear the forest or manage pasture. The context is especially complex in the Chico Mendes reserve, where some former rubber tappers are eager to make more money by turning to cattle or illegally selling their rubber tree groves to ranchers. Luzineide said the federal agency in charge of managing the reserve, the Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation, also known as ICMBio, does not have enough people to curb environmental crime in the 3,600-square-mile (about 9,300 square kilometers) reserve. She said she requested their presence for weeks, but agents came only two days after the fires and briefly detained a man suspected of setting them. He was arrested for illegal possession of a weapon and released after posting bail. The ICMBio did not respond to questions from AP. But Mauro Pires, president of the institute, addressed Luzineide's case when he was asked about it on the sidelines of an ecotourism congress last week near Rio de Janeiro. Pires said the Mendes reserve had been deliberately targeted for its symbolism, and in what he called a coordinated effort to disrupt rubber tappers' lives. He suggested that Luzineide could seek help from a government program that offers protection to grassroots leaders and public servants who face threats. Marina Silva, Lula's minister of Environment and Climate Change and herself a former rubber tapper, told AP in an August interview that Bolsonaro was to blame for deforestation inside the reserve. She urged patience as the government designs an ecological transition toward a low-carbon national economy. Lula has promised to end net deforestation by 2030 — two years beyond his current term. The federal government is hiring new personnel for the understaffed environmental agencies, but the process is bureaucratic and it will take months to train new officials before being deployed for fieldwork. Mary Allegretti, an anthropologist who was a close friend of Mendes and has spent decades working to improve the lives of rubber tappers in the Amazon, said the ICMBio's response to Luzineide's pleas was “unacceptable and inexcusable.” “What is the role of ICMBio in the reserve if it can’t verify a complaint in time to prevent the burning of rubber trees, which is her livelihood?"" Allegretti said. Angela Mendes, a daughter of Mendes and herself a social activist, blamed large-scale land ownership that she said is entrenched in Brazil's political system. She said stopping continued deforestation requires electing a more diverse Congress and getting state governments and the attorney general involved against criminal activities. “These are complex issues that can be resolved with political will,"" she said. Rubber tapping has been the main source of income for Luzineide’s family for three generations. She is part of a network of 500 rubber tappers who sell their production to Veja, a French shoemaker, currently the only buyer of local rubber. About 10% of the rubber tappers are women, according to the local cooperative. “I want you to publish my story,” Luzineide said. “For this is not only my pain but also that of thousands of people who live inside the reserve. If something happens to me, if I fall, my story will already be written."" ___ This story has corrected the first name of the president of the Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation to Mauro, not Maurilo. ___ Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

2023-12-09,"Brazil's Lula takes heat on oil plans at UN climate talks, a turnaround after hero status last year",17,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Fresh off election victory, a year ago Brazilian President-elect Inacio Lula da Silva was the star of the annual U.N. climate talks. Lula promised to crack down on deforestation and turn Brazil into an environmental leader, a complete turnaround after President Jair Bolsonaro rolled back regulations and encouraged land-grabbing in the Amazon. “Lula! Lula! Lula!” many onlookers screamed during Lula’s many events at COP27 in Egypt. What a difference a year makes. Just as Lula addressed world leaders at COP28 in Dubai, it was announced that Brazil would join OPEC+, a group of big oil-exporting countries, including Russia. At one event during the conference, Lula tried to explain the decision by saying that, once on the inside, the South American nation would push other oil-producing countries to transition to green energy—a curious explanation given that state-run oil company Petrobras is focused on further oil exploration. Lula later clarified that Brazil would be an OPEC observer, not a full member. In his speech to world leaders, Lula implored delegates to go beyond “eloquent but empty words.” In a subsequent session with Environment Minister Marina Silva, Lula teared up when he talked about the need to protect forests. Instead of chants of adulation, Brazil received a Fossil of the Day award from Climate Action Network International, a non-award given to countries whose actions support fossil fuels, the main cause of climate change. Natalie Unterstell, president of Talanoa, a Brazilian think tank focused on climate, said Lula's approach to the environment was focused on curbing deforestation, Brazil's largest source of carbon emissions, which his administration has managed to slow by half since taking office in January. That approach served him well during his first terms, between 2003 and 2010, but that is no longer enough, she said. “Lula can’t be a climate leader without a real energy transition policy,” she said. “It's time for him to update his programming software.” Lula has had a long and complicated relationship with oil. When huge reserves were discovered off Brazilian shores in 2006, Lula said: “This discovery ... proves that God is Brazilian.” Indeed, as the Brazil became a major oil-producer over the next decade, the money helped Lula, and then successor President Dilma Rousseff, fund major social programs that lifted tens of millions of people from poverty. Today, Brazil is the world's ninth largest producer, with 3% of global output, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Oil has become so important that it's now Brazil's second export product after soy, producing 3.67 million barrels a day. By far, China is the country's largest buyer. At a climate conference focused on reducing planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, which oil and gas products let off when burned, environmentalists have been quick to note the contradiction. Meanwhile, Petrobras is doubling down on oil. On Dec. 13, a day after the climate conference is scheduled to end, the country is going to allow companies to bid on 33 areas with blocks for oil exploration, according to Brazil's National Agency of Oil, Natural Gas and Biofuels, including some in the Amazon rainforest. It's part of a push to offer more than 900 blocks in December. In a written response to the AP, the National Agency of Oil, Natural Gas and Biofuels declined to comment on demands for energy transition, arguing that, as a regulatory agency, it “does not create public policies but rather implements the policies formulated by the government."" The increased exploration, which eventually leads to more production, threatens to cancel out or even surpass gains from Brazil's efforts to stop net deforestation by 2030, according to the Greenhouse Gas Emission Estimation System, an initiative by the Climate Observatory, a network of environmental nonprofit groups. “The damage (of the exploration) goes against any positioning of Brazil as a climate leader,"" said David Tsai, projects coordinator at the Institute for Energy and the Environment, which is part of Climate Observatory. While Lula fumbled during the few days he spent at COP28, his Colombian counterpart, leftist Gustavo Petro, seemed to be taking the mantle of environmental leadership in Latin America. In contrast to Brazil’s alignment with OPEC, Petro joined an alliance of nations supporting a fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty. “This is not economic suicide,” he said in Dubai. “It’s about preventing humanity’s self-destruction.” The leaders' differing visions were on display in August during the Amazonian summit in Belem. Lula and other leaders vetoed Petro’s proposal to ban oil production in the world’s largest rainforest. Similar to the ongoing climate talks, oil was the most contentious topic during the meeting held in Belem. At the time, Lula faced protests by Indigenous groups and environmentalists against Petrobras’ plans to explore for oil near the mouth of the Amazon River.

2023-12-10,"Brazil's Lula takes heat on oil plans at UN climate talks, a turnaround after hero status last year",18,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Fresh off election victory, a year ago Brazilian President-elect Inacio Lula da Silva was the star of the annual U.N. climate talks. Lula promised to crack down on deforestation and turn Brazil into an environmental leader, a complete turnaround after President Jair Bolsonaro rolled back regulations and encouraged land-grabbing in the Amazon. “Lula! Lula! Lula!” many onlookers screamed during Lula’s many events at COP27 in Egypt. What a difference a year makes. Just as Lula addressed world leaders at COP28 in Dubai, it was announced that Brazil would join OPEC+, a group of big oil-exporting countries, including Russia. At one event during the conference, Lula tried to explain the decision by saying that, once on the inside, the South American nation would push other oil-producing countries to transition to green energy—a curious explanation given that state-run oil company Petrobras is focused on further oil exploration. Lula later clarified that Brazil would be an OPEC observer, not a full member. In his speech to world leaders, Lula implored delegates to go beyond “eloquent but empty words.” In a subsequent session with Environment Minister Marina Silva, Lula teared up when he talked about the need to protect forests.

2023-08-09,"Brazil's Amazon Summit ends with a plan to protect the world's rainforests, but no measurable goals",19,"BELEM, Brazil — Brazil’s Amazon Summit closed Wednesday with a roadmap to protect tropical rainforests that was welcomed as an important step in countering climate change, but without the concrete commitments sought by some environmentalists to end deforestation. Leaders and ministers from eight Amazon nations signed a declaration Tuesday in Belem, Brazil, that laid out plans to drive economic development in their countries while preventing the Amazon’s ongoing demise “from reaching a point of no return.” Several environmental groups described the declaration as a compilation of good intentions with little in the way of measurable goals and timeframes. However, it was lauded by others, and the Amazon’s umbrella organization of Indigenous groups celebrated the inclusion of two of its main demands. “It is significant that the leaders of the countries of the region have listened to the science and understood the call of society: the Amazon is in danger, and we do not have much time to act,” the international group WWF said in a statement. “However, WWF regrets that the eight Amazonian countries, as one front, have not reached a common point to end deforestation in the region."" Joining the summit Wednesday were the presidents of the Republic of Congo and the Democratic Republic of Congo, an emissary from Indonesia’s president, and France’s ambassador to Brazil, representing the Amazonian territory of French Guiana. An emissary of Norway, the largest contributor to Brazil’s Amazon Fund for sustainable development, also attended. The national representatives on Wednesday signed a similar, but much slimmer, agreement to that of their counterparts the prior day; it likewise contained no concrete goals and mostly reinforced criticism of developed nations for failure to provide promised vast climate financing. The eight nations attending on Tuesday — Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Peru, Suriname and Venezuela — are members of the newly revived Amazon Cooperation Treaty Organization, or ACTO, who hope that a united front will give them a major voice in global environment talks ahead of the COP 28 climate conference in November. The summit reinforces Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva's strategy to leverage global concern for the Amazon’s preservation. Emboldened by a 42% drop in deforestation during his first seven months in office, he has sought international financial support for forest protection. Speaking to reporters after Wednesday’s meeting, Lula railed against “protectionist measures poorly disguised as environmental concern” that restrict imports from developing nations, and said developed nations must make good on their pledges to provide monetary support for forest protection. “Nature, which industrial development polluted for 200 years, needs them to pay their part so we can revive part of what was ruined. Nature is in need of money,” Lula said. The Amazon stretches across an area twice the size of India. Two-thirds of it lies in Brazil, with seven other countries and the territory of French Guiana sharing the remaining third. Governments have historically viewed it as an area to be colonized and exploited, with little regard for sustainability or the rights of its Indigenous peoples. All the Amazon countries have ratified the Paris climate accord, which requires signatories to set targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. But cross-border cooperation has historically been scant, undermined by low trust, ideological differences and the lack of government presence. The members of ACTO — convening for only the fourth time in the organization’s 45-year existence — demonstrated Tuesday they aren’t fully aligned on key issues. Forest protection commitments have been uneven. And their joint declaration didn’t include a shared commitment to zero deforestation by 2030, as some had hoped. Brazil and Colombia have already made that commitment. Some scientists say that when 20% to 25% of the forest is destroyed, rainfall will dramatically decline, transforming more than half of the rainforest to tropical savannah, with immense biodiversity loss. The Climate Observatory, a network of dozens of environmental and social groups, as well as Greenpeace and The Nature Conservancy lamented the lack of detailed pledges in the declaration. “The 113 operating paragraphs of the declaration have the merit of reviving the forgotten ACTO and recognize that the biome is reaching a point of no return, but doesn’t offer practical solutions or a calendar of actions to avoid it,” the Climate Observatory said in a statement. Colombian Indigenous leader Fany Kuiru, from the Coordinating Body of Indigenous Organizations of the Amazon Basin, praised the declaration for fulfilling two of their primary requests — an acknowledgment of their rights to traditional territories and the establishment of a mechanism for the formal participation of Indigenous peoples within ACTO. Bruna Santos, director of the Brazil Institute at the Woodrow Wilson Center, said the summit demonstrated “an effort to treat the Amazon as a regional agenda,” but that it also highlighted ambiguities in the priorities of Brazil’s government, including with respect to oil exploration. Colombia’s president spoke forcefully about the hypocrisy of pushing for Amazon preservation while pursuing oil, equating it to betting “on death and destroying life."" Lula has refrained from taking a definitive stance on oil, citing the decision as a technical matter. Meanwhile, Brazil’s state-run Petrobras company has been seeking to explore for oil near the mouth of the Amazon River. Despite disagreements, there were signs of increased regional cooperation and growing global recognition of the Amazon’s importance in arresting climate change. A collective voice — along with funneling more money into ACTO — could help it serve as the region’s representative on the global stage ahead of the COP climate conference, leaders said. Anders Haug Larsen, the head of international advocacy at Rainforest Foundation Norway, said that the Amazonian nations are correct to demand more money from developed nations, and that their political will to protect the rainforest represents a historic opportunity. “With the plan from this summit and continuous reduced deforestation, this is where the international community should put its climate money,” he said. ___ Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

2023-12-20,Brazilian State Seeks Millions in Environmental Damages From Giant Meatpacker,20,"Rondônia State officials say JBS, the world’s biggest meat producer, is buying cattle raised in an illegally deforested Amazon reserve. The Brazilian authorities are seeking millions of dollars in damages and fines from the world’s biggest meatpacker, JBS, and three smaller slaughterhouses, according to court filings that accuse them of buying cattle raised on illegally deforested lands in the Amazon rainforest. The lawsuits come as JBS is pursuing a listing on the New York Stock Exchange, which would give the company expanded access to capital. They are expected to increase pressure on the company, which was recently the subject of a Senate hearing because of its supply chain’s links to deforestation. The United States is JBS’s largest market. The 17 suits, brought by Rondônia State, in the country’s west, say that the companies have bought cattle raised in one of the Amazon’s most devastated protected areas, the Jaci-Paraná Extractive Reserve, which has lost 77 percent of its forest cover since it was created in 1996. Dozens of members of the traditional communities there have left in fear of the land-grabbers and ranchers who have taken over most of the reserve. JBS is the biggest purchaser of cattle from the Amazon rainforest, and experts say ranching is the biggest driver of deforestation there. Forest destruction, coupled with climate change, is already transforming humid ecosystems that store huge amounts of planet-warming gases into drier zones that instead release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. The result is a double blow against efforts to combat climate change and biodiversity loss. A Times investigation in 2021 found that leather from cattle raised in Jaci-Paraná had ended up on the seats of pickup trucks, S.U.V.s and other vehicles sold by some of the world’s largest automakers. JBS was a key supplier of the leather. At the time, it disputed allegations that it had bought cattle raised on illegally deforested lands. In a statement on Wednesday, JBS said that it runs a robust monitoring system in Brazil that covers an area three times the size of Britain to guarantee its suppliers do not occupy any areas illegally. “JBS is committed to a sustainable beef supply chain,” the company said. Three of the 17 lawsuits, which were first reported by The Associated Press and Agência Pública, are against JBS and a group of farmers who are accused of selling the company cattle raised on farms in the reserve. The other suits are against three smaller meatpackers that are accused of buying hundreds of cattle raised in the reserve. The Rondônia State authorities say farmers sold 227 cattle raised on about 1,000 acres of illegally deforested land to JBS between 2019 and 2021. The state is seeking almost $3.5 million in damages from the company and the farmers. It is also imposing fines of more than $400,000 on JBS, though those could be challenged in court. Attorneys for the state did not reply to a request for comment. JBS has made some progress in compliance in recent years, after federal prosecutors in Pará State filed lawsuits seeking environmental damages from a group of meatpackers in 2009. Prosecutors did not win the case but went on to establish a program that audits cattle purchases. An audit of JBS’s cattle purchases in Pará found that 6 percent had come from so-called irregular ranches, a steep drop from 2020, when an audit found that 32 percent of animals had come from irregular sources. The same audit in Rondônia this year found that 12 percent of cattle purchases by JBS did not comply with the law. Under the administration of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, deforestation rates in the Brazilian part of the rainforest have fallen to a five-year low over the past 12 months. “There are signs things are improving,” said Paulo Barreto, a researcher who focuses on cattle ranching at Imazon, a nonprofit research organization based in Belém, Brazil. But, he added, change was not coming fast enough. Governments come and go, he said, so “this stronger commitment from companies is very important to signal to politicians that things won’t go back to the way they were before.” Lawsuits that seek to hold meatpackers responsible for deforestation are rare, Mr. Barreto said. That’s partly because purchases of cattle raised in illegally deforested lands are often hard to trace; they go through middlemen who present documents falsely attesting that the animals came from legal farms, the 2021 Times investigation found. Daniel Azeredo, a federal prosecutor who has been investigating cattle ranching for more than a decade, said the Rondônia lawsuits “strengthen the need for the country to improve traceability.” Without that, he added, “we will keep having the same problems.” A judge in Rondônia, Pedro Sillas Carvalho, signaled doubts about the lawsuits brought by the state, according to one filing from last week. He wrote that the state attorneys needed to factor in the economic effects of their actions, because the exit of illegal farmers from the reserve could cause “loss of revenue.” The Times was unable to reach Judge Sillas Carvalho for comment.

2023-07-25,"JPMorgan, Citi under fire for funding fossil fuels in the Amazon",23,"As the Amazon may face a catastrophic tipping point that’s eroding its status as a major carbon sink, a new study maps out which banks have pumped the most money into oil and gas extraction from the world’s largest rainforest. An analysis by Stand.earth, a nonprofit with offices in Canada and the US, lists JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. as the two banks that have dominated financial backing to fossil fuels in the Amazon basin over the past 15 years. In all, JPMorgan and Citigroup were behind $3.8 billion in loans and bonds for oil and gas production and infrastructure, according to Stand.earth. Since 2009, a total of 160 banks have channeled $20 billion in direct funding to oil and gas in the Amazon, the analysis found. Those activities have contributed to pollution and deforestation which, along with drought and fires, have pushed the Amazon close to passing a “tipping point” that may turn rainforests into grasslands within a few decades, according to climate scientists.  “Banks have a critical role to play in shifting the energy economics behind the climate crisis,” said Angeline Robertson, lead researcher at Stand.earth. “We continue to see financing for the expansion of oil and gas in the world’s biggest rainforest.” A spokesperson for Citigroup said the bank “continues to strengthen” its environmental and social risk management policy to protect sensitive areas like the Amazon. JPMorgan declined to comment. In 2021, scientists found that parts of the Amazon had begun to emit more CO2 than they absorb, turning them from a carbon sink to a source. That means the Amazon may start contributing more greenhouse gases to the environment than it removes, exacerbating the climate crisis.  The fallout from global overheating is becoming increasingly obvious, as temperatures soar to deadly highs across much of the globe, breaking previous records and demonstrating that the planet has already lurched into a new era of weather extremes. Actions that contribute to rising emissions will make it harder to avoid a climate catastrophe. Recognizing what’s at stake, some banks have pledged to stop backing fossil fuels in the Amazon. In May 2022, BNP Paribas SA said it “will no longer finance any oil and gas projects and related infrastructure” in the area.  HSBC Holdings Plc, which has provided $1.3 billion in direct finance to oil and gas in the Amazon over the past decade and a half, said in December that it would halt such activities. And other banks have committed to end trade finance for some Amazon oil. These moves send “important signals” that other banks too should “review their relationship to Amazon destruction” and take steps to manage that risk, Stand.earth said. Fany Kuiru, coordinator of indigenous organizations of the Amazon basin, described oil expansion in the area as “a latent threat” to people and ecosystems, adding that it drives degradation and deforestation and leads to chronic disease and contamination of food and water sources. “We urge the largest bank investors to leave the Amazon immediately,” Kuiru said. The Stand.earth analysis, which is based on Bloomberg data, also listed Bank of America Corp., Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Banco Santander SA, Itaú Unibanco Holding SA and Banco Bradesco SA as prominent financiers of oil and gas in the Amazon over the years. A Santander spokesperson said the bank is “fully committed to supporting the transition to net zero” and has set 2030 emissions reduction targets across a range of sectors in its loan book, including oil and gas. An HSBC spokesperson pointed Bloomberg to the bank’s updated energy policy, adding HSBC “will no longer provide new finance or advisory services for new oil and gas fields, or any O&G fields and related infrastructure in environmentally and socially critical areas such as the Amazon Biome.” A spokesperson for Itaú Unibanco said the bank has been working to reduce deforestation in the Amazon region by monitoring environmental, social and climate risks, and also by “defining decarbonization targets” for carbon-intensive sectors, including oil and gas. Goldman Sachs and Bank of America declined to comment. Bradesco hasn’t responded to a request for comment. Brazil President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva plans to host a meeting of government leaders next month in the city of Belem to renew the Amazon Cooperation Treaty Organization. Talks are expected to focus on how to better protect the forest and indigenous people and attract greener investment."
2023-07-28,Brazil's Indigenous chief fighting to save Amazon urges President Lula to defend people's rights,24,"BRASILIA, Brazil — The Amazon's most famous Indigenous leader called upon Brazil's president on Friday to defend the rights of Indigenous people. Chief Raoni Metuktire demanded that “invaders” be removed from their territories and that the government stop negotiations on carbon credits that had excluded Indigenous people from the discussions. In a letter to President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, Raoni demanded a government response to 11 specific requests by Aug. 9, the second and final day of the Amazon summit that Lula and other South American heads of state will attend in the city of Belem. The manifest was handed over to the minister of the Indigenous peoples, Sonia Guajajara, at an event attended by 1,000 members of different ethnic groups in the town of Sao Jose do Xingu in the state of Mato Grosso. Lula in May signed legislation paving the way for a market to trade carbon credits — generated by reducing greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change, and which may be purchased to comply with eventual limits on emissions. Lula's administration is reportedly drafting regulation for the carbon market's operation and plans to present it in the coming months. But Raoni said in his letter that Indigenous people have not been included in the process, and that their participation is required for the drafting of just legislation that takes their rights into consideration. Raoni, now in his 90s, also demanded the government take a “concrete position” on an upcoming court ruling that threatens to strip some Indigenous territories of their designations. The Supreme Court is in the process of evaluating whether Indigenous peoples must have been physically occupying their territories before 1988 in order to uphold their land claims. For years, Raoni has campaigned for the protection of Indigenous territories in the Amazon. A 1978 documentary, ""Raoni: The Fight for the Amazon,” contributed to his fame, as did a 1989 tour with British musician Sting. The letter also demanded a halt to mining activities that have triggered a health crisis among the Yanomami people during the previous government of far-right President Jair Bolsonaro as illegal gold miners swarmed into their territory. Lula’s government has spent months expelling most of them from Yanomami lands. Some remain, however, working at night to avoid being caught, Rodrigo Agostinho, the head of environmental agency Ibama, said earlier this month. Raoni's letter also demanded mass testing of Indigenous people for exposure to mercury — widely used by gold prospectors to separate the metal — and medical treatment for those affected. It also condemned so-called “agricultural partnerships” set up under Bolsonaro that forced Indigenous people to work in farming, saying they are “unconstitutional and go against the model of cultural sustainability.” Friday's event in Sao Jose do Xingu also showcased a letter from Britain's King Charles expressing support for Raoni and noting a common desire to see the Amazon protected. As a way of safeguarding their land, Brazil's Indigenous people have pushed for establishment of more Indigenous territories, a slow process that can take years. Brazil has so far established 732 Indigenous territories, occupying more than 117 million hectares (453,000 square miles) — or nearly 14% of the country's vast expanse, according to data from the Instituto Socioambiental. Of 14 territories that the government said would be created, only six have been established so far under Lula's latest, third term in office that started in January. However, deforestation in the Amazon rainforest has dropped 33.6% in his first six months from the same period of 2022, an encouraging sign for his administration’s environmental efforts. Lula campaigned last year with pledges to rein in illegal logging and undo the environmental devastation under Bolsonaro. Raoni walked alongside Lula up the presidential palace's ramp before his inaugural address on Jan. 1."
2023-06-27,"Despite Global Pledges, Tree Loss Is Up Sharply in Tropical Forests",25,"The pace of deforestation increased 10 percent in 2022, but there are signs the trajectory may change for the better in the near future. More than a year after countries pledged to end deforestation by 2030, the world is continuing to lose its tropical forests at a fast pace, according to a report issued on Tuesday. The annual survey by the World Resources Institute, a research organization, found that the world lost 10.2 million acres of primary rainforest in 2022, a 10 percent increase from the year before. It is the first assessment to cover a full year since November 2021, when 145 countries pledged at a global climate summit in Glasgow to halt forest loss by the end of this decade. “We had hoped by now to see a signal in the data that we were turning the corner on forest loss,” Frances Seymour, a senior fellow at the institute’s forest program, said. “We don’t see that signal yet, and in fact we’re headed in the wrong direction.” The report, done in collaboration with the University of Maryland, documented tree loss in the tropics from deforestation, fires and other causes. Last year’s destruction resulted in 2.7 gigatons of carbon dioxide emissions, a significant amount that is roughly equivalent to the annual fossil fuel emissions of India, a country of 1.4 billion. Tropical deforestation also degrades some of the planet’s richest ecosystems, the habitats for plants and animals and the regulators of rain patterns for several countries. The Amazon rainforest, the largest in the world, hasn’t faced such enormous destruction in almost two decades, according to an analysis of the World Resources Institute data by Amazon Conservation, a research organization. Brazil, the country with the largest portion of tropical rainforest, had the highest rates of deforestation globally. It accounted for more than 40 percent of tree loss globally, followed by the Democratic Republic of Congo and Bolivia. Bolivia delivered some of the report’s most striking numbers. Forest loss there went up 32 percent last year, the highest rate on record for that country. It was one of the few tropical forest countries that did not sign the Glasgow commitment on deforestation. Marlene Quintanilla, a research director at the Fundación Amigos de la Naturaleza, a nonprofit group in Bolivia, said a powerful driver of destruction in that country has been a government policy that encourages farmers to clear vast tracts to secure land titles. “The standing forest isn’t seen as fulfilling any social or economic function,” she said. The expansion of agriculture appeared to be hurting forests in Africa. In Ghana, the country that lost the biggest proportion of its primary forest last year, small-scale clearing for cocoa production was a major source of deforestation. Forest clearing is strongly linked to a lack of economic opportunities and basic infrastructure in the Congo River Basin region. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, for example, most people don’t have access to electricity, so the forest is an important source of firewood and charcoal for cooking. Teodyl Nkuintchua, who works on strategy and outreach for the World Resources Institute in the Congo Basin area, said policies to curb environmental harm would not work by themselves. “Unless we integrate development priorities in those actions in those countries, we will not be able to address deforestation,” he said. One of the few bright spots in the report came from Southeast Asia, where efforts to curb deforestation in Malaysia and Indonesia continued to yield results. A logging moratorium, efforts to restore peatlands, and corporate commitments to exclude palm oil suppliers linked to deforestation appear to be effective. And there are signs the trajectory of global deforestation may change for the better in the near future. The European Union this year delivered a push in that direction, adopting a law that bans the import of a series of products that contribute to deforestation in tropical countries. China, the world’s largest importer of many agricultural commodities, has recently committed to cracking down on illegal deforestation linked to its trade with Brazil. Brazil also seems to be changing course. President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva took office in January vowing to protect the Amazon rainforest, and preliminary numbers for the first five months of the year suggest deforestation rates there have declined by 31 percent since January. Deforestation and environmental crime had increased sharply under his predecessor, Jair Bolsonaro. The report’s analysis focuses on the tropics because forest loss there is usually more permanent and tends to be caused by human activity. Tropical forests also have a greater role in storing carbon and supporting biodiversity. But global tree cover loss beyond the tropics was down 10 percent last year. According to the report, the decline was a direct result of fewer wildfires in the boreal forests of Russia. But this could change. Canada is on track to have its worst fire season on record. El Niño, a climate pattern that is usually associated with more wildfires in the tropics, has also just arrived. There is concern that, even if countries are able to curb deforestation during this period, wildfires could erase some of their efforts. “An El Niño year will be a test,” Rod Taylor, the global director for forests at the World Resources Institute, said, adding that he hoped fires would not wreak havoc. “But we’ll have to see.” This article appeared in print on page A5."

2024-03-13,Brazil’s Clashing Goals: Protect the Amazon and Pump Lots More Oil,27,"State-owned Petrobras could soon be the world’s third-biggest oil producer, in stark contrast to the country’s promises to fight climate change and slow Amazon destruction. Through his office window, the head of Brazil’s state-run oil company looked out at the cluttered landscape of Rio de Janeiro. Looking back at him, across the city’s run-down high-rises, was the looming statue of Christ the Redeemer. Hawks circled an overflowing trash heap. Plumes of smoke rose from a blaze in a hillside shantytown. His company, Petrobras, is planning such a rapid increase in oil production that it could become the world’s third-largest producer by 2030, a transformation he believes could play a role in lessening the poverty dotting his vista. This, even as his country positions itself as a leader in the fight against climate change which, of course, is primarily driven by the burning of oil and other fossil fuels. Petrobras already pumps about as much crude oil per year as ExxonMobil, according to Rystad Energy, a market research firm. Over the next few years, it is projected to hurtle past the national oil companies of China, Russia and Kuwait, leaving only Saudi Arabia’s and Iran’s pumping more than Petrobras by 2030. It’s an enormous predicament for Brazil’s president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, better known simply as Lula, who has fashioned himself as the pre-eminent world leader on climate issues. By all accounts, Mr. Lula has come around in recent years to believing climate change is a major driver of poverty and inequality, which he has spent his decades-long political career vowing to eradicate. Since being elected in 2022, Mr. Lula has drastically reduced deforestation in the Amazon and overseen a sizable build-out of renewable energy. But he will also preside over Petrobras’ oil boom and a period of growing gas imports, both of which will facilitate Brazil growing hunger for cheap flights, meatier diets and air-conditioned homes. However contradictory that might seem, it’s only fair, said Jean Paul Prates, the Petrobras chief executive, perched up high in his company’s gleaming headquarters. “We will not give up that prerogative,” he said, “because others are not doing their own sacrifice as well.” It’s an argument that bedevils global efforts to reduce reliance on fossil fuels. Industrialized countries like the United States, which became economic superpowers by emitting huge amounts of greenhouse gases, are still the world’s biggest per capita producers and consumers of fossil fuels. And if they won’t stop, why should Brazil? Mr. Lula’s lead adviser on climate change, Ana Toni, a longtime director of various nonprofit groups, said that, ideally, Petrobras would be scaling back on oil and investing more heavily in renewables, essentially transforming itself into a new kind of company. But she echoed Mr. Prates and said that until the whole world moved together, with the richest leading the way, developing countries would balk at making their own sacrifices. Like many in Brazil, Ms. Toni pointed to the cautionary example of neighboring Colombia, whose president embarked on an ambitious plan, the first for any oil-producing country, to phase out its production of the fossil fuel. “Colombia’s brave decision is being taken by the market as creating economic insecurity. It’s really the worst-case scenario,” she said. “I wish countries richer than ours would have a real conversation about taking such steps, and not leave it to us vulnerable ones.” That tension has dominated years of climate negotiations and will once again be front and center at this year’s United Nations-sponsored summit being held in November in Azerbaijan. There, negotiators from nearly all the world’s nations are hoping to tackle the thorny issue of how richer countries can channel more money toward poorer ones to help them both adopt cleaner energy sources as well as adapt to climate change’s effects. After Azerbaijan, the next host of the U.N. climate summit will be Brazil itself. The summit will be in Belém, a city at the edge of the Amazon, near a place where Petrobras had proposed exploring for oil. But in one of the few instances of Brazil’s government curtailing the oil industry, the idea was blocked. Mr. Prates said Petrobras was appealing the decision. Meanwhile, Petrobras plans to spend north of $7 billion over the next five years on exploration of potential offshore drilling sites along other stretches of Brazil’s coast to augment its already growing production. Petrobras, like many other oil and gas companies, internally projects that demand for its products will remain stubbornly high. Accordingly, the company operates on a starkly different set of assumptions than those envisioned by the International Energy Agency and others who say demand for oil has either already peaked or is close to doing so. That leaves countries like Brazil in a kind of do-everything gray area, said Mercedes Bustamante, a professor and ecologist at the University of Brasília, and a member of the Climate Crisis Advisory Group, an independent group of scientists. Brazil is growing both renewables and fossil fuels. This year it joined OPEC, the global oil cartel, as an observer, even as next year it plans to host the U.N.’s global climate negotiations. By 2030 it will be the world’s fifth-biggest oil producer, according to Rystad’s data. This dynamic is reflected, too, in forests, Ms. Bustamante said. Land clearing in the Amazon has been curtailed, but it is simultaneously rising in the Cerrado, a vast savanna that covers much of central Brazil. “Having it both ways is very much part of Brazil’s policy DNA,” said Oliver Stuenkel, professor at the School of International Relations at Fundação Getulio Vargas in São Paulo. “We will be a green superpower, yes, but we’re not going to take unnecessary risks. That means preparing for a world in which oil will play an important role for a long time and the transition takes longer than expected.” Mr. Prates said he spoke with Mr. Lula every two weeks and was pushing him to understand that a transition away from fossil fuels needs to be “wisely slow.” “That means not slow because we don’t want to do transition, but slow because we need to correspond to expectations of the market for oil, gas and its derivatives,” he said. “Petrobras will go up to the end of the last drop of oil, just as Saudi Arabia or the Emirates will do the same.” Petrobras has some serious advantages in the long run, even if oil demand is peaking. Oil from Brazil’s offshore sites near Rio and São Paulo costs roughly $35 per barrel to produce, well below the international benchmark of $90. That is partly because it is less energy intensive to produce, which makes it marginally cleaner and more desirable for some emissions-conscious buyers. Mr. Lula’s government also faces a polarized electorate that generally, according to recent surveys, doesn’t consider climate change a voting issue. “Half the population doesn’t have access to treated sewage,” Mr. Stuenkel said. “Brazil has a very different set of public demands than richer countries. There’s a very long way to go in convincing Brazilian voters that there needs to be a painful reorganization of society to stave off climate change.” Nevertheless, Mr. Lula does deeply care, said Ms. Toni, his climate adviser. The world is relying on Brazil for leadership on this issue, and it has made ambitious pledges to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions. Those pledges are more ambitious, she made sure to note, than those of the United States or many other countries that have higher standards of living than Brazil. It as a good sign, she thinks, that Brazil is under pressure to rethink its oil expansion. To her, it means they’ve been so successful on the deforestation front that people are holding them to a higher standard. But that’s all for naught if the biggest players don’t mirror that ambition. “Even if Brazil stops producing oil tomorrow,” she said. “the U.S., Russia and others will not stop.” PHOTOS: Jean Paul Prates, the chief executive of Petrobras, Brazil’s state-run oil company.

2023-12-19,"Brazil lawsuits allege direct relationship between meatpackers, deforesters on protected land",28,"JACI-PARANA, Brazil — Meat processing giant JBS SA and three other slaughterhouses are facing lawsuits seeking millions of dollars in environmental damages for allegedly purchasing cattle raised illegally in a protected area in the Brazilian Amazon. The lawsuits, filed December 5 to 12 by the western Brazilian state of Rondonia, target the exploitation of a protected area known as Jaci-Parana, once rainforest but now mostly transformed into grassland by decades of misuse by land-grabbers, loggers and cattle ranchers. Despite a law forbidding commercial cattle in the reserve, some 216,000 head now graze on pasture there, according to the state animal division. The lawsuits contain a type of evidence that is getting the attention of deforestation experts and veterans of Brazil's illegal cattle trade: transfer documents showing cows going straight to the slaughterhouse from protected areas, with the information apparently provided by the illegal ranchers themselves. “In two decades fighting illegal cattle-raising in the Amazon, I had never encountered a transit permit with the name of a conservation unit on it,” said Jair Schmitt, chief of environmental protection at Brazil’s federal environmental agency, Ibama. ___ This article was produced as part of a collaboration between Brazilian news organization Agencia Publica and The Associated Press. ___ Of the 17 lawsuits, three name JBS, along with farmers, who allegedly sold 227 cattle raised in Jaci-Parana. The suits seek some $3.4 million for “invading, occupying, exploiting, causing environmental damage, preventing natural regeneration, and/or taking economic advantage” of the protected lands. JBS declined to answer questions from The Associated Press, saying it “has not been summoned by the court, which makes it impossible to conduct any analysis yet.” Three smaller meatpacking companies are also accused of causing environmental harm by buying cattle from the reserve. Frigon, Distriboi and Tangara did not respond to questions. Frigon has ties to influential people in Rondonia politics and is accused of buying the largest number of cattle — almost 1,400 head from eight illicit ranches. The state's attorney is seeking $17.2 million from Frigon and those farmers. Both Frigon and the two JBS plants allegedly involved have exported meat to the U.S., as well as to China, the largest buyer of Brazilian beef, Hong Kong, Russia, Egypt, Morocco, Spain, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and others, according to data from Panjiva, a company that uses customs records to track international trade. The lawsuits aim to put a price on the destruction of old-growth rainforest, a difficult task given that it is virtually irreplaceable except over decades. A court filing pegs damages in the reserve at some $1 billion. It is unclear whether the hundreds of other invaders in Jaci-Parana will also be sued for compensation. “The invaders and their main business partners – loggers and meatpacking companies – make the profits their own while passing on to society the costs of environmental damage,” the lawsuits say. In one indication of the potential seriousness of the new lawsuits, a court officer trying to serve an eviction notice to one of the illegal farmers in the reserve said he was threatened with death. Deforestation is a major concern in the Amazon rainforest, where many seek to profit from its vast resources through mining, timber harvesting, agriculture and more. Besides harming a critical biosphere, the development pressure also threatens a critical carbon sink for a planet that's warming dangerously from climate change. Two-thirds of Amazon deforestation results from conversion to pasture, according to the government. Rondonia, on the border with Bolivia, is the most badly deforested state in the Brazilian Amazon. The creation of Jaci-Parana Reserve and other state conservation areas was funded by the World Bank in the 1990s as a kind of atonement, the bank says. Years before, it had financed the construction of highway BR-364, a road that brought thousands of settlers into the forest from southern Brazil. In five decades, about 40% of it was gone, according to Mapbiomas, a Brazilian consortium of nonprofits, universities and technology startups. Other conservation units were also invaded by land-grabbers, with little objection from authorities. Some Brazilian administrations even encouraged it. In 2010, President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, in his second term, reduced the Bom Futuro National Forest, adjacent to Jaci-Parana, by two-thirds. Land grabbers eventually gained title to what was supposed to be protected forest. In 2019, far-right Jair Bolsonaro was elected president, as was his ally Marcos Rocha as governor of Rondonia, on campaigns promising to legalize illegal land holders. Land-grabbers plowed onto conservation lands. With the political promises, 778 land invaders were induced to come forward and register the property they were occupying as well as their cattle for health inspection.  “It reveals the contradiction between public agencies, with the animal health agency validating cattle that are illegally raised,” said Paulo Barreto, a senior researcher with Imazon, a non-profit that monitors cattle in the region. “It also reveals the fragility of JBS' control system.” The potential money to be made was irresistible. Privatization of Jaci-Parana would have meant adding swaths of public land to the real estate market. The 151,000 hectares (583 square miles) converted to grassland would be worth around $453 million, according to geographer Amanda Michalski, a researcher at Rondonia Federal University. And the new owners would have gotten that land for free. In its statement, JBS declined to comment on its operations in Rondonia but said in the Amazon as a whole, 94% of purchases are of legal cattle, quoting an audit published in October by Brazil´s Federal Prosecution Service, which regularly scrutinizes cattle sales to counter deforestation caused by the meat trade. Yet the same audit found that 12% of cattle purchased by JBS in Rondonia came from illegally deforested areas. And those audits only examine direct purchases. They don't track the vast trade in cattle laundering in Brazil, transferring cows from an illegal area to a legal farm before selling to slaughterhouses, deliberately muddying traceability. In November, a report by Imazon called JBS the company most likely to purchase cattle from illegally deforested areas based on a variety of factors, including where slaughterhouses are located and their buying areas. “Companies must boycott cattle areas at high risk for illegal activity and lack of enforcement,” Barreto, co-author of the study, said. “By purchasing cattle from these areas, companies endorse predatory and illegal behavior and strengthen the political power of these actors.” Last July, AP journalists visited Jaci-Parana and saw on the ground what satellite imagery detected from space: the only forested areas left were along two rivers. With almost 80% destroyed, it's the most ravaged conservation unit in the Brazilian Amazon. Jaci-Parana is designated an extractive reserve, a type of protection in which forest communities are allowed to live their traditional ways without logging, protected from land-grabbing and cattle-ranching. But the opposite happened. Dozens of families who once made their living by tapping rubber trees inside the reserve and harvesting Brazil nuts have been expelled by force. The few remaining live along the riverbanks — most afraid to be interviewed for fear of being attacked. Lincoln Fernandes de Lima, 45, whose family has lived in the area for three generations, described land-grabbers who ""remove all the timber and Brazil nuts trees. They get to the water source, already having cut down the trees around it, and keep cutting, cutting,” he said in an interview in July. ""When the residents leave their houses to do something in the forest, they shoot up the pots and pans. And many, many times the houses are cut down with a chainsaw.” In September, two men carrying guns paid a visit to de Lima, claiming their boss had acquired the area. They gave him 24 hours to leave. He took it as a death threat and complied — the third time he had been forced out of the reserve. Five days later, his neighbor, rubber tapper Efigenio Mota da Silva, had his home burned down. They fled to Jaci-Parana village, where scores of families of expelled subsistence gatherers have sought shelter. The village has also been the home of Rosa Maria Lopes. She was born 1952 in a rubber grove inside the reserve. Her family lived in the same area for over a century, but was also driven out by cattle farmers. Where she grew up is now pasture. “There’s nothing left there,” she told the AP on the porch of her daughter's home. ""No one talks about Brazil nuts, copaiba oil trees or rubber anymore. There’s no talk about corn, pumpkin, or whatever is served on the table. It’s only cattle, farms, and pasture. Are we only going to eat grass?” ___ Valente reports for Agencia Publica.

Industrialized countries like the United States, which became economic superpowers by emitting huge amounts of greenhouse gases, are still the world's biggest per capita producers and consumers of fossil fuels.  And if they won't stop, why should Brazil?  Mr. Lula's lead adviser on climate change, Ana Toni, a longtime director of various nonprofit groups, said that, ideally, Petrobras would be scaling back on oil and investing more heavily in renewables, essentially transforming itself into a new kind of company. But she echoed Mr. Prates and said that until the whole world moved together, with the richest leading the way, developing countries would balk at making their own sacrifices.  Like many in Brazil, Ms. Toni pointed to the cautionary example of neighboring Colombia, whose president embarked on an ambitious plan, the first for any oil-producing country, to phase out its production of the fossil fuel.  ''Colombia's brave decision is being taken by the market as creating economic insecurity. It's really the worst-case scenario,'' she said. ''I wish countries richer than ours would have a real conversation about taking such steps, and not leave it to us vulnerable ones.''  That tension has dominated years of climate negotiations and will once again be front and center at this year's United Nations-sponsored summit being held in November in Azerbaijan. There, negotiators from nearly all the world's nations are hoping to tackle the thorny issue of how richer countries can channel more money toward poorer ones to help them both adopt cleaner energy sources as well as adapt to climate change's effects.  After Azerbaijan, the next host of the U.N. climate summit will be Brazil itself. The summit will be in Belém, a city at the edge of the Amazon, near a place where Petrobras had proposed exploring for oil. But in one of the few instances of Brazil's government curtailing the oil industry, the idea was blocked. Mr. Prates said Petrobras was appealing the decision.  Meanwhile, Petrobras plans to spend north of $7 billion over the next five years on exploration of potential offshore drilling sites along other stretches of Brazil's coast to augment its already growing production.  Petrobras, like many other oil and gas companies, internally projects that demand for its products will remain stubbornly high. Accordingly, the company operates on a starkly different set of assumptions than those envisioned by the International Energy Agency and others who say demand for oil has either already peaked or is close to doing so.  That leaves countries like Brazil in a kind of do-everything gray area, said Mercedes Bustamante, a professor and ecologist at the University of Brasília, and a member of the Climate Crisis Advisory Group, an independent group of scientists.  Brazil is growing both renewables and fossil fuels. This year it joined OPEC, the global oil cartel, as an observer, even as next year it plans to host the U.N.'s global climate negotiations. By 2030 it will be the world's fifth-biggest oil producer, according to Rystad's data.  This dynamic is reflected, too, in forests, Ms. Bustamante said. Land clearing in the Amazon has been curtailed, but it is simultaneously rising in the Cerrado, a vast savanna that covers much of central Brazil.  ''Having it both ways is very much part of Brazil's policy DNA,'' said Oliver Stuenkel, professor at the School of International Relations at Fundação Getulio Vargas in São Paulo. ''We will be a green superpower, yes, but we're not going to take unnecessary risks. That means preparing for a world in which oil will play an important role for a long time and the transition takes longer than expected.''  Mr. Prates said he spoke with Mr. Lula every two weeks and was pushing him to understand that a transition away from fossil fuels needs to be ''wisely slow.''  ''That means not slow because we don't want to do transition, but slow because we need to correspond to expectations of the market for oil, gas and its derivatives,'' he said. ''Petrobras will go up to the end of the last drop of oil, just as Saudi Arabia or the Emirates will do the same.''  Petrobras has some serious advantages in the long run, even if oil demand is peaking. Oil from Brazil's offshore sites near Rio and São Paulo costs roughly $35 per barrel to produce, well below the international benchmark of $90. That is partly because it is less energy intensive to produce, which makes it marginally cleaner and more desirable for some emissions-conscious buyers.  Mr. Lula's government also faces a polarized electorate that generally, according to recent surveys, doesn't consider climate change a voting issue. ''Half the population doesn't have access to treated sewage,'' Mr. Stuenkel said. ''Brazil has a very different set of public demands than richer countries. There's a very long way to go in convincing Brazilian voters that there needs to be a painful reorganization of society to stave off climate change.''  Nevertheless, Mr. Lula does deeply care, said Ms. Toni, his climate adviser.  The world is relying on Brazil for leadership on this issue, and it has made ambitious pledges to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions. Those pledges are more ambitious, she made sure to note, than those of the United States or many other countries that have higher standards of living than Brazil.  It as a good sign, she thinks, that Brazil is under pressure to rethink its oil expansion. To her, it means they've been so successful on the deforestation front that people are holding them to a higher standard.  But that's all for naught if the biggest players don't mirror that ambition. ''Even if Brazil stops producing oil tomorrow,'' she said. ''the U.S., Russia and others will not stop.''

2023-08-09,"Amazon nations seek common voice on climate change, urge developed world to help protect rainforest",30,"BELEM, Brazil — Leaders from South American nations that are home to the Amazon challenged developed countries on Tuesday to do more to stop massive destruction of the world’s largest rainforest, a task they said can’t fall to just a few when the crisis has been caused by so many. Assembling in the Brazilian city of Belem, the members of the Amazon Cooperation Treaty Organization, or ACTO, also sought to chart a common course on how to combat climate change, hoping a united front will give them a major voice in global talks. The calls from the presidents of nations including Brazil, Colombia and Bolivia came as leaders aim to fuel much-needed economic development in their regions while preventing the Amazon’s ongoing demise “from reaching a point of no return,” according to a joint declaration issued at the end of the day. Some scientists say that when 20% to 25% of the forest is destroyed, rainfall will dramatically decline, transforming more than half of the rainforest to tropical savannah, with immense biodiversity loss. “The forest unites us. It is time to look at the heart of our continent and consolidate, once and for all, our Amazon identity,” said Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. “In an international system that was not built by us, we were historically relegated to a subordinate place as a supplier of raw materials. A just ecological transition will allow us to change this.” The two-day summit ending Wednesday reinforces Lula’s strategy to leverage global concern for the Amazon’s preservation. Emboldened by a 42% drop in deforestation during his first seven months in office, he has sought international financial support for forest protection. The Amazon stretches across an area twice the size of India. Two-thirds of it lie in Brazil, with seven other countries and one territory share the remaining third. Governments have historically viewed it as an area to be colonized and exploited, with little regard for sustainability or the rights of its Indigenous peoples. All the countries at the summit have ratified the Paris climate accord, which requires signatories to set targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. But cross-border cooperation has historically been scant, undermined by low trust, ideological differences and the lack of government presence. Aside from a general consensus on the need for shared global responsibility, members of ACTO — convening for only the fourth time in the organization’s existence — demonstrated Tuesday they aren’t fully aligned on key issues. This week marks the first meeting of the 45-year-old organization in 14 years. Forest protection commitments have been uneven previously, and appeared to remain so at the summit. The “Belem Declaration,” the gathering’s official proclamation issued Tuesday, didn’t include shared commitments to zero deforestation by 2030. Brazil and Colombia have already made those commitments. Lula has said he hopes the document will be a shared call to arms at the COP 28 climate conference in November. A key topic dividing the nations on Tuesday was oil. Notably, leftist Colombian President Gustavo Petro called for an end to oil exploration in the Amazon — an allusion to the ambivalent approach of Brazil and other oil-producing nations in the region — and said that governments must forge a path toward “decarbonized prosperity.” “A jungle that extracts oil — is it possible to maintain a political line at that level? Bet on death and destroying life?” Petro said. He also spoke about finding ways to reforest pastures and plantations, which cover much of Brazil's heartland for cattle ranching and growing soy. Lula, who has presented himself as an environmental leader on the international stage, has refrained from taking a definitive stance on oil, citing the decision as a technical matter. Meanwhile, Brazil’s state-run Petrobras company has been seeking to explore for oil near the mouth of the Amazon River. Despite disagreements among nations, there have been encouraging signs of increased regional cooperation amid growing global recognition of the Amazon’s importance in arresting climate change. Sharing a united voice — along with funneling more money into ACTO — could help it serve as the region's representative on the global stage ahead of the COP climate conference, leaders said. “The Amazon is our passport to a new relationship with the world, a more symmetric relationship, in which our resources are not exploited to benefit few, but rather valued and put in the service of everyone,” Lula said. Bolivian President Luis Arce said the Amazon has been the victim of capitalism, reflected by runaway expansion of agricultural borders and natural resource exploitation. And he noted that industrialized nations are responsible for most historic greenhouse gas emissions. “The fact that the Amazon is such an important territory doesn’t imply that all of the responsibilities, consequences and effects of the climate crisis should fall to us, to our towns and to our economies,” Arce said. Petro argued that affluent nations should swap foreign debt owed by Amazon countries for climate action, saying that would create enough investment to power the Amazon region’s economy. Signed by officials from eight nations, the Belem Declaration also: — Condemns the proliferation of protectionist trade barriers, which signatories said negatively affects poor farmers in developing nations and hampers the promotion of Amazon products and sustainable development. — Calls on industrialized nations to comply with their obligations to provide massive financial support to developing nations. — Calls for the strengthening of law enforcement cooperation. Commits authorities to exchanging best practices and intelligence about specific illicit activities, including deforestation, human rights violations, trafficking of fauna and flora and the sale and smuggling of mercury, a highly toxic metal widely used for illegal gold mining that pollutes waterways. Colombia's Petro also called for the formation of a military alliance akin to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, saying such a group could be tasked not only with protecting the Amazon, but tackling another major problem for the region: organized crime. Few border areas are policed seriously and there has been scant international cooperation as rival organized crime groups compete for drug-trafficking routes. Drug seizures have increased in Colombia, Brazil, Bolivia and Peru over the past decade, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) reported in June.

2023-09-15,Brazil restores stricter climate goals,32,"RIO DE JANEIRO — Brazil is reinstating stronger greenhouse gas commitments it made in 2015 as part of the Paris Agreement that were weakened under former President Jair Bolsonaro. The announcement was made Thursday by the country's Committee on Climate Change, a joint body made up of 18 government ministries. “Brazil is a major actor in helping the planet in this challenging moment,"" Vice President Geraldo Alckmin said during the committee meeting in Brasilia. The change will be officially transmitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the international body that works to advance global action on climate change. It tracks each country's Nationally Determined Contribution or commitment to reducing national emissions in accordance with the Paris Agreement. During the tenure of far-right President Bolsonaro, Brazil backtracked on its Nationally Determined Contribution calculation twice. The most recent weakening occurred in 2021 and was estimated by the Climate Observatory, a network of numerous environmental and social groups, to increase Brazil’s target emissions by 73 million metric tons of CO2 by 2030. Brazil’s target under the Paris Agreement is 1.2 billion metric tons of CO2. Releasing its own analysis Friday, the Talanoa Institute, a climate policy-focused think tank, called the restoration merely an initial step, saying bolder commitments are needed. The Institute said the emissions target process should be opened to society as a whole in contrast to what it called the closed-door decision-making that has taken place up until now. This would enable Brazil to set more ambitious targets, not merely reinstate commitments from 2015, it argued. Brazil is the world’s fifth-largest emitter of greenhouse gases, contributing nearly 3% of global emissions, according to Climate Watch, an online platform managed by the World Resources Institute. Almost half of these emissions stem from destruction of trees in the Amazon rainforest, which reached a 15-year high during Bolsonaro’s presidency. The former president dismantled Brazil’s environmental agencies in favor of expanding agribusiness, neglecting preservation efforts. In a stark turnaround, President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has reduced deforestation by 48% for the period from January to August. ____ Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

2023-09-20,Biden and Brazil's Lula focus on workers' rights while publicly playing down differences,34,"NEW YORK — President Joe Biden and his Brazilian counterpart, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, played up their mutual affection for workers’ rights Wednesday as the leaders of the Western Hemisphere’s two largest democracies met in New York, steering clear in public about their differences on Ukraine and other matters. They announced a new partnership on supporting labor while avoiding openly discussing disagreements such as U.S. policy toward Cuba and Russia’s war in Ukraine, mere hours before Lula’s first-ever bilateral meeting with his Ukrainian counterpart. In remarks to reporters, Biden and Lula were eager to display their shared goals on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly. Biden sought to tie the meeting to domestic matters. Long a champion of labor unions, Biden is navigating strikes in the U.S. by autoworkers, screenwriters and actors who are seeking better pay and protections in a changing global economy. He has declined the request by the United Auto Workers leader to join the picket line. “When the middle does well, everybody does well,” Biden told Lula. “Working-class folks have a chance to move up. And the wealthy still do fine, as long as they pay their taxes.” Lula said he had never heard an American president speak so highly of workers and described their common cause as a chance to transform ties between the countries. “This meeting here, for me, is more than a bilateral meeting; it is the rebirth of a new era in the relationship between the U.S. and Brazil. It is a relationship of equals,” Lula said. He later described it as “a golden moment for us.” Initial hopes that Lula would prove a staunch ally for Biden have been tempered in recent months, with the Brazilian leader voicing opposition on some issues and at times even seeming to thumb his nose at Washington. That has included dismissing allegations of Venezuela's authoritarianism, calling for decreased dependence on the dollar for global trade and accusing the U.S. of fueling bloodshed in Ukraine by providing military aid — and refusing to supply munitions himself. In his speech at the U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday, Lula criticized the U.S. embargo and sanctions targeting Cuba. The White House issued a readout that showed Biden privately raised some of his policy disagreements with Lula. The U.S. president tried to make the case that Russia’s war in Ukraine has hurt poorer countries by pushing up food and energy prices, saying that Russia should return to its grain deal with Ukraine to help relieve those pressures. Biden also outlined the steps that he believes should be taken to aid democracy in Venezuela. The U.S. president had frosty relations with Lula's predecessor, Jair Bolsonaro, an open admirer of Donald Trump who waited weeks before recognizing Democrat Biden’s 2020 election victory over Republican Trump. After Bolsonaro's defeat, his supporters stormed Congress, the Supreme Court and presidential palace in Brasilia in an attempt to oust Lula from power. The circumstances bore a clear resemblance to Trump and the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol. Lula quickly traveled to Washington, where he and Biden reflected on the challenges to democracy they had both overcome. The goal of their new partnership on labor is to stop the exploitation of workers and forced and child labor, as well as workplace discrimination, and create a possible template for others in the Group of 20 to join. The two leaders also want to guarantee that the move away from fossil fuels to renewable energy emphasizes the rights of workers. Biden sees support from organized labor as an essential part of his 2024 reelection efforts, stressing that his policies will create factory and construction jobs that do not require a college degree. “Whether it’s the auto workers or any other union worker, record corporation profits should mean record contracts for union workers,” said Biden as he tried to link the announcement to the ongoing U.S. strikes. Lula got his start in politics as leader of a powerful metalworkers' union and, on Wednesday, highlighted that he spent more than two decades in factories and has no degree himself. “This gesture we are doing here is an awakening of hope for millions and millions of Brazilians and Amdericans who need to have the opportunity to live life, to triumph, to work and build their family decently,” Lula said. Also high on their Wednesday agenda was environmental preservation. Lula has presented himself as a leader on this front, and his administration has made significant progress in the Amazon. Deforestation of the Amazon had soared to a 15-year high under Bolsonaro, who called for the development of the rainforest, emboldening loggers and miners to invade protected areas, while defanging environmental authorities. Lula began rebuilding those agencies, created eight protected areas for Indigenous people, and expelled thousands of miners from the massive Yanomami Indigenous territory. Deforestation dropped by nearly half in his first eight months. He has sought international contributions for Brazil’s Amazon Fund, but donations have been small and symbolic. In February, the U.S. committed to a $50 million donation to the initiative, though it has yet to be provided. Biden later announced he would ask Congress for an additional $500 million, which has yet to be committed. “It is very important that the United States sees what is happening in Brazil at this historic moment of ecological transition, of changing the energy matrix, the potential our country has for investment,” Lula said. Later Wednesday, Lula and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy held their bilateral meeting. It was “icebreaking,” Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine's foreign minister, told reporters afterward. Lula has refused to join Washington and Western Europe in backing Ukraine’s fight against Russia’s invasion, and previously called for a club of nations to mediate peace talks. At one point this year, he said both nations had chosen to go to war, but he backtracked following backlash. “The conversation was very warm and honest, and I think both presidents now understand their positions much better than before,” Kuleba told reporters. Brazil's foreign minister Mauro Vieira echoed those sentiments, and said Lula told Zelenskyy that Brazil is willing to join a group of nations chosen by Ukraine and Russia to promote the possibility of peace. “There is in no way disagreement between the two heads of state,” Vieira said. ___ Boak reported from Washington."
2023-10-02,Brazil's government starts expelling non-Indigenous people from two native territories in the Amazon,35,"SAO PAULO — Brazil’s government on Monday began removing thousands of non-Indigenous people from two native territories in a move that will affect thousands who live in the heart of the Amazon rainforest. The South American nation’s intelligence agency ABIN said in a statement that the goal is to return the Apyterewa and Trincheira Bacaja lands in Para state to the original peoples. It did not say whether or not the expulsion of non-Indigenous people has been entirely peaceful. The territories are located around the municipalities of Sao Felix do Xingu, Altamira, Anapu and Senador Jose Porfirio in Para state. Brazil's government said the country’s Supreme Court and other judges had ordered the operation. Indigenous groups estimate more than 10,000 non-Indigenous people are living inside the two territories. ABIN said as many as 2,500 Indigenous people live in 51 villages within. “The presence of strangers on Indigenous land threatens the integrity of the Indigenous (people) and causes other damages, such as the destruction of forests,” the agency said in its statement. It added that about 1,600 families live illegally in that region with some involved in illegal activities such as cattle raising and gold mining. ""They also destroy native vegetation.” The Apyterewa territory had the most deforestation of any Indigenous land in Brazil for four years running, according to official data. Footage obtained by local media and shared on social media in September showed hundreds of non-Indigenous people living in a newly built town with restaurants, bars and churches deep inside the lands of the Parakana. Other authorities that participated in the action on Monday included Brazil's ministry of Indigenous Peoples, environment protection agency IBAMA, the federal police and armed forces, among many others. Several of those bodies were defanged and did little to protect Indigenous peoples’ territories during the far-right administration of former President Jair Bolsonaro between 2019 and 2022. Brazil’s President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva began rebuilding environment protection agencies and has so far created eight protected areas for Indigenous people. Soon after the beginning of his administration, his government expelled thousands of gold miners from the massive Yanomami Indigenous territory in the northern state of Roraima. State and federal authorities this year also dislodged landgrabbers from the Alto Rio Guama territory. They threatened forcible expulsion of those settlers failing to leave, and pledged to eliminate access roads and irregular installations; nearly all of the illegal residents departed voluntarily. Encroachment on such territories over recent years prompted Brazil’s top court on Thursday to enshrine Indigenous land rights by denying a suit backed by farmers that sought to block an Indigenous group from expanding the size of its territorial claim. In the case before the court, Santa Catarina state argued that the date Brazil’s Constitution was promulgated — Oct. 5, 1988 — should be the deadline for when Indigenous peoples to have already either physically occupied land or be legally fighting to reoccupy territory. Nine of 11 justices of Brazil’s Supreme Court ruled against that argument, a decision that has far-reaching implications for territories nationwide."
2023-08-08,CLIMATE GLIMPSE: Here's what you need to see and know today,36,"Amid misery, humans find a way to cope — as seen in this image of flooding following heavy monsoon rains in Kathmandu, Nepal. Associated Press photographer Niranjan Shrestha made this picture of a man putting his child on a plastic vessel to play on Tuesday in the spreading waters of the Bagmati River. Meanwhile, in South Korea on Tuesday, tens of thousands of Scouts were arriving at inland cities after a tropical storm prompted the government to evacuate the World Scout Jamboree. Tropical Storm Khanun's path toward the Korean Peninsula raised alarms about the scouts' coastal campsite in Saemangeum, where last week's high heat had already required treatment for more than 100 people at the event. The evacuation involved some 37,000 Scouts from 156 countries, shifting them to university dormitories, government and corporate training centers and hotels inland to continue cultural events and activities. Here’s what else is happening related to extreme weather and the climate right now: —The European climate monitoring organization made it official Tuesday: July 2023 was Earth's hottest month on record by a wide margin.

2023-06-12,EU Commission chief talks with Brazil's president about stalled trade deal,37,"BRASILIA, Brazil — European Comission President Ursula von der Leyen met with Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva on Monday in a bid to get a free trade deal moving again. The 27-member EU completed negotiations in 2019 on a wide-ranging trade deal with Mercosur — comprised of Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay — but it has yet to be ratified by any of the individual countries. Ratification stalled during the presidency of Lula’s predecessor, Jair Bolsonaro, due to the EU's concern over his environmental policies as well as a European desire to protect its local farmers from cheaper imports from Mercosur. Proposed modifications of the original agreement have yet to get the process back on track. In March, the EU sent a letter to Mercosur seeking to establish stricter environmental requirements for South American countries in order to persuade European nations to ratify the deal. “We are very much looking forward to your answer, because it is our opening to listen to you, to listen where we have to improve,” von der Leyen said in prepared remarks after her meeting with Lula. “So that we can, indeed, by the end of the year, conclude the Mercosur agreement.” But Brazil’s president openly expressed dismay with the proposal. “The premise that needs to exist among strategic partners is of mutual trust and not distrust and sanctions,” he said. The March letter doesn't explicitly mention sanctions, but rather proposes to make mandatory some of the environmental goals established by the Paris Agreement. Brazilian Foreign Minister Mauro Vieira has said that different interpretations of European law could mean failure to fulfill goals would result in sanctions. The EU-Mercosur trade agreement is meant to link two markets with a total population of around 800 million people and accounting for about a fourth of the world’s gross domestic product. It envisions leading to more than $100 billion in annual trade of goods and services by cutting customs duties and easing access for Mercosur agricultural exporters to the EU market and for European manufacturers to Mercosur countries. Since Lula became president in January, members of his administration have raised questions about the agreement, said Lucas Leite, a professor of international relations at the Armando Alvares Penteado Foundation, a university in Sao Paulo. He said their concerns include whether Brazil's industrialized goods will be able to compete with European competitors and the possibility the nation could be negatively affected. “The environmental standards are a challenge for the Brazilian government, which talks about the need to reindustrialize the country,"" Leite said. ""This agreement would not be good for Brazil. We are only able to compete in the agricultural sector.” Two officials within the foreign relations ministry told The Associated Press that many Brazilian diplomats are arguing that the EU's March proposal provides a good excuse to not ratify the agreement. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Amid the uncertainty over the deal, von der Leyen sought to show European solidarity with Brazil by announcing new spending programs. She said the EU will invest 2 billion euros ($2.2 billion) for hydrogen production, a green energy project aimed at lessening dependence on fossil fuels. She said the EU also will provide 430 million euros to help fight deforestation and 20 million euros to the Amazon Fund to preserve the Amazon Forest. “This is only the start,” von der Leyen said, adding that individual European nations and private donors are expected to complement the total. “Europe is back in Brazil, Europe is back in Latin America.” Von der Leyen met with executives from Brazil’s industrial sector after her session with Lula. Brasilia is the first stop on her Latin America tour. She will now travel to Argentina, Chile and Mexico, and meet with each nation's president. In July, EU members and the heads of state from the Community of Latin American and Carribean States are scheduled to hold a summit. ___ Associated Press writer Raf Casert in Brussels contributed to this report."
2023-08-24,"Support grows for sustainable development, a 'bioeconomy,' in the Amazon",38,"BELEM, Brazil — If all goes according to plan, in a few weeks people will be sipping a shake that Marcelo Salazar has been developing for three years, made from the Amazon jungle’s cornucopia. His company Mazo Mana Forest Food has partnered with communities that live from the forest and gather the Brazil nuts, cocoa beans, acai, mushrooms, fruits and other ingredients that go into the drinks. They have received some backing from a business incubator based in Manaus that focuses on sustainable forest businesses, to counter an economy based on logging and ranching. “To turn the game around, I think it takes a new generation of ventures that combine different business models,"" Salazar said. Some hope sustainable ventures like this will be part of a new “bioeconomy,” a buzzword at the Amazon Summit in Belem in early August, where policymakers voiced eagerness to protect the rainforest and provide a livelihood for tens of millions of rainforest residents. But beyond general support for the notion, there was little consensus about what exactly a bioeconomy should look like. Salazar attended and spoke on a panel organized by Brazil’s environment ministry titled “The challenge of building an Amazon bioeconomy.” The idea is not new. It is the latest term for sustainable livelihood, or sustainable development or the green economy. Small to mid-size examples of it exist across the Amazon. Besides the Brazil nuts and acai harvesters, people are making chocolate from native cocoa. A sustainable fishery for one of the world’s largest freshwater fish has given river communities an alternative to logging. Production of sneakers for fashionable Parisians has restored hope for a community of rubber tappers who labored on the verge of obsolescence with the advent of synthetic rubber. “The challenge is scale,” Para state Gov. Helder Barbalho said in an interview on the sidelines of the summit. His state is believed to be the only one in Brazil that has an actual bioeconomy plan. Para is Brazil’s top producer of acai, yet its economy is far more dependent on iron ore exports to China. So much land in Para has been converted to pasture for an estimated 27 million cattle that it emits more greenhouse gases than any Amazon country besides Brazil. But when it comes to larger sustainable enterprises, there are few success stories. The brightest example has been cosmetics company Natura, which two decades ago launched a product line using ingredients from traditional Amazon communities and family farms. Developing these relationships took patience and research, said Priscila Matta, sustainability senior manager at Natura. When the company started, local people were felling ucuuba trees to make brooms. They tripled their income by leaving the trees standing and selling the seeds to Natura. That is just one among dozens of Natura's bioingredients, helping the company contribute to the conservation of more than 2 million hectares (about 7,700 square miles) of forest. About 8% of what Natura spent on raw inputs last year went for Amazon bioingredients. They come from 41 communities – home to 9,120 families – who in 2022 received about $9 million, some of it direct payments to keep the forest standing. The bioeconomy pitch can also veer toward pie-in-the-sky. Speaking to reporters at the Amazon Summit, Brazil’s planning and budget minister Simone Tebet said that driving a vibrant economy while keeping the forest standing “is our dream, but dreams exist to be realized.” “Banks are interested,"" Tebet said. “Imagine big industries without smokestacks, industries for the good, taking root in Amazon states ... learning from the Indigenous people from whom everything comes.” Para state’s bioeconomy plan strikes a similarly utopian tone: “The Amazon Forest is like an enormous library of knowledge and wisdom that has yet to be discovered,” it reads. The plan gets into specifics, naming 43 forest-compatible products that could be exported, including acai, cocoa, cassava, pepper, fish species and essential oils for cosmetics. Para has started building a complex to serve as a bioeconomy incubator to house researchers and start-ups, scheduled for completion before the state capital of Belem hosts the 2025 global climate conference. Para's public bank, Banpara, has launched a subsidized lending program for small farmers who want to develop agroforestry. “We can balance the scenario of a living forest and people being cared for, being seen,” Barbalho said in the interview. Neighboring Amazonas state is developing a bioeconomy plan with the financial support of the U.S. Agency for International Development. The federal government is also starting to move beyond mere words. This month, Brazil’s economy minister, Fernando Haddad, announced an Ecological Transformation Plan. It proposes using a climate fund to back sustainability projects and setting up rules for Brazil’s carbon market. But some earlier efforts reveal pitfalls. A state condom factory in the Amazon city of Xapuri that opened in 2008 during President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva’s previous term was supposed to provide a market for hundreds of rubber-tapper families living in the region where the late environmental leader Chico Mendes was killed. The factory closed 10 years later, after federal subsidies came to an end. Locals resorted to cattle ranching and today the region ranks high for deforestation. Cocoa beans are another cautionary tale. The trees can be a way to let forest grow back where it has been cut down but its appeal in places like the Ivory Coast and Ghana has meant massive deforestation to make way for the more lucrative trees. Salazar, the CEO of Mazo Mana, the forest shake company, views his enterprise as both social-minded and market-savvy. It reserves nearly 10% equity for its partner community associations and, to the extent possible, production takes place locally to add value and develop expertise. Salazar thinks the sustainable companies that succeed and grow big will be those with a mission to solve the Amazon’s problems, and they will drive a transformation toward an economy that recognizes the value of the forest. ___ Associated Press reporter Fabiano Maisonnave contributed from Belem. ___ Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

2023-11-16,Poverty is killing the Amazon rainforest. Treating soil and farmers better can help save what's left,39,"TEKOHAW, Brazil — At dawn in this small Amazonian village in Brazil's Para state, flocks of noisy green parrots soar overhead as children run and play between wooden homes, kicking up sandy soil — in places white and bare as a beach. The ground reveals one of the paradoxes of the rainforest. Renowned for its beauty and biodiversity, the life-giving nutrients of the forest are mostly stored in the trees and other plants, not the soil. When the forest is cleared — for a cattle ranch, soybean field or even a small cluster of village homes — the combination of scorching Amazonian sun and intense rainfall combine to leach scarce nutrients from the soil in just a few years, leaving behind surprisingly barren ground. Soil rich in organic matter is black, but here it’s sometimes the color of bone. Some ecologists call it a “wet desert.” This impoverished dirt makes it difficult to sustain agriculture in one place. And in a region with some of the highest poverty levels in Brazil, people with few options have often just abandoned degraded fields and cleared more forest — hastening the cycle of deforestation that threatens the planet’s climate and the millions of species unique to the Amazon. “The biodiversity is rich, but so many people are very poor,” said Judson Ferreira Valentim, a soil scientist for the government’s agricultural research agency, Embrapa. “We can’t protect the rainforest without addressing the poverty of the Amazon.” ___ EDITORS’ NOTE — This story is part of The Protein Problem, an AP series that examines the question: Can we feed this growing world without starving the planet? To see the full project, visit https://projects.apnews.com/features/2023/the-protein-problem/index.html ___ The only way to meet both goals is to find more paths for people to make a living in the Amazon without further destroying the rainforest, say experts who have long worked in the region. That means using already deforested land more efficiently — to reduce pressure to clear more forest — as well as supporting businesses that sustainably harvest native products such as açaí and cacao. Valentim, who works in the northern state of Acre, where he’s lived for four decades, points from the window of his truck to areas of abandoned farmland: some are patches of bare soil or red clay; some are overgrown with dark shrubby weeds. The scale of abandoned farm and pastureland across the Brazilian Amazon is massive — covering an area larger than Portugal, according to an AP analysis of data derived from satellite imagery by the Brazilian research collaboration Mapbiomas. Other researchers estimate that ranching, which accounts for between 60% and 80% of deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon, is only a third as productive as it should be, and that increasing the efficiency on the same land area would more than meet increasing demands for meat through 2040. Brazil is a major exporter of beef to global markets, and currently 43% of Brazil’s cattle are raised within the Amazon region, according to an AP analysis of government data. “You have to enforce laws against deforestation, but that’s only part of the solution. You also have to give people alternatives” to improve their livelihoods, said Rachael Garrett, a researcher at Cambridge University who’s conducted fieldwork in the Amazon since 2006. There are 28 million people living in just Brazil’s portion of the Amazon — including Indigenous farmers, ranchers who migrated from other parts of the country, and settlers forcibly relocated decades ago when the government took their old land for infrastructure projects like the Itaipú Dam. “You can’t ignore that millions of people are living there,” Garrett said. “The more their needs are ignored, the worse some problems get.” SUPERCHARGING THE SOIL Nearly everyone in the Amazon starts work early, aiming to finish before the worst of the midday sun. Valentim is on the road at dawn to visit families who’ve tried new techniques to squeeze more production out of the soil. Dairy farmer Edson Cesar de Oliveira waves from his porch. The son of a subsistence rubber tapper from Acre, his family lives in a small wooden home that he built himself. Chickens cluck in the yard, and clothes flap on a laundry line. Cleonice Farina de Oliveira, his wife, offers black espresso and slices of homemade cheese to visitors. For the past few years, the family has been experimenting with planting a native legume called forage peanuts alongside grass in their pastures. This plant attracts bacteria to its roots that can pull nitrogen from the air into the ground, essentially acting as a low-cost natural fertilizer. While grass-only pastures may degrade in just two or three years, adding legumes may extend the soil’s fertility to ten or more years. It’s also higher in protein than grass alone, which helps livestock grow faster. And it’s easier than grass alone on the cattle’s digestive system, reducing their methane emissions. De Oliveria, who said he can’t afford chemical fertilizers, has noticed that pastures with forage peanuts don’t turn as yellow during the dry season. And cows that graze there for at least two nights produce about 20% more milk, he said. That increases the amount of cheese that the family can make to sell in local markets. “We always sell out of our cheese,” said Cleonice, as she pulled on rubber boots to go milk the cows. After coaxing the first three animals into wooden pens, she, her husband and their 22-year-old son Thalisson each took a milking station. The family provides all the labor on their small farm. On another day, Valentim visits a larger family ranch owned by Luiz Augusto Ribeiro do Valle. Do Valle said the last year he cleared new forest to expand the ranch was 2007. Now he’s focused on improving productivity. In addition to planting forage peanuts in his pastures, he has changed the way he grazes cattle. Holding up a detailed map of his ranch, he said, “You take a large pasture, divide it into smaller areas and rotate where the cattle graze.” The goal is to keep cattle always feeding on new grass, while other areas regrow — the new growth is more nutritious and easier to digest. Cows bray in the distance and dragonflies buzz at his feet as he strolls up a hill, periodically bending to inspect the grass. “You have to keep checking the plan against the reality on the ground,” he said. By combining rotational grazing and forage peanuts, he said he can keep between 20% and 40% more cattle on the same amount of land. HARD REALITIES OF THE RAINFOREST But even these simple innovations can be hard for some poor ranchers in the Amazon to implement. In a region with poor roads and spotty internet and cell-phone service, it’s hard to spread information about better farming practices. Many small ranchers can’t afford fertilizers, tractors and other modern farming supplies. And drug trafficking, illegal mining and violence also make it difficult to work on the Amazon frontier. Of the nearly 1 million farms in Brazil’s Amazon region, 83% are small family farms and ranches, according to government figures. Many operate on shoestring budgets. As President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva’s government ramps up enforcement of environmental laws — reversing the policies of Jair Bolsonaro and so far curbing overall deforestation by 22%, according to Brazil's national space agency — some experts say it’s small-scale ranchers and farmers that are still most at risk for clearing rainforest. “When you have fewer choices, you take bigger risks,” said René Poccard-Chapuis, an agronomist at the French agricultural research agency CIRAD who has worked in the region for three decades. Like Valentim, he’s focused on helping farmers and ranchers — especially small operators — find low-cost solutions to improve their livelihoods. In Para state, in the eastern Amazon, Lucas dos Santos has a very modest ranch. He can’t afford a horse to ride or hired labor, but moves the cattle between pastures himself, holding a cattle prod in one hand. He said he was unable to afford the price of new fencing to start rotational grazing for his small herd of 22 cattle. Then CIRAD researchers showed him how to use branch clippings from native trees in place of commercial fence posts. The clippings, taken from trees on his property, put out new roots quickly, so he only had to pay for wires — and can now rotate his cattle. TASTES OF THE RAINFOREST: AÇAÍ AND CACAO César De Mendes is trying to grow a business in the rainforest without cutting any trees at all. Walking through the forest along a tributary of the Amazon in Pará, he points out bright yellow fruits that sprout, sometimes in pairs, from the middle of tree trunks. It’s cacao, the plant responsible for one of the world’s great joys: chocolate. His company, De Mendes Chocolates, uses cacao harvested from virgin rainforest. He’s hoping customers will appreciate how different microclimates and soil conditions across the region subtly impact the flavor of the chocolate. “You can taste the different environments,” he said. His small business sells mostly to upscale groceries and tourist shops. One of six employees at this location, Neilanny Maia, fulfills online orders by hand, devoting a room of her home to storing seed bags and finished chocolate bars. The idea of harvesting rainforest fruits is simple, but scaling up a sustainable business isn’t always easy. Just getting fruit to market before it spoils can be a huge challenge. Last year during the rainy season, one road was closed for 90 days. One solution is to build small processing factories near the forest, as the longstanding agricultural collective Projeto RECA has done in Brazil’s northern state of Rondônia. One afternoon, light breaks through the canopy of virgin rainforest as 37-year-old açaí picker Edson Polinario tilts his head backward, squinting, looking for promising trees. Once he’s chosen his target, he propels himself up the narrow palm trunk, using bands to grip the trunk securely. With a stroke of his machete, he slices off a rack of açaí berries that resemble dark beads on a chandelier. Then he slides down the trunk like it’s a firepole. Every day a worker comes to Polinario’s house to collect bags of açaí, then hauls them back to Projeto RECA’s campus on the back of a motorcycle. Açaí berries spoil quickly and are practically worthless if not processed and frozen within two days. At the factory, they’re transformed into jams, syrups and frozen fruit pulp, ready to be shipped to supermarkets. But there are other challenges to locating the business on the Amazon frontier. If factory equipment breaks, the team must dissemble it and drive parts several hours for repair. “We are too far from the big cities” for on-site maintenance, said Hamilton Condack de Oliveira, the president of the collective of about 200 households. But still, they’ve managed to survive since the collective was founded in 1989. They harvest from both virgin rainforest and agroforests planted on abandoned pastureland. Planting an agroforest — essentially a large orchard of mixed native tree species — doesn’t aid biodiversity and climate as much as simply retaining old-growth forest, but it’s much better than tending pasture or monoculture row crops. “People will visit and say, ‘Oh that’s beautiful,’ but it’s a lot of work,” he said. ‘THE FOREST SUSTAINS US’ The impacts of climate change are already being felt locally in the Amazon region, forcing other adaptations. For as long as their stories tell, the Indigenous Tembé people of Tekohaw village have used fire to clear small plots of land to grow cassava, beans and other subsistence crops. After farming for three years, they’d clear new land. Because their plots were small, the overall impact on the forest was minimal. But now the village chief wants to find other ways to manage the soil’s fertility. “We don’t want to use fire anymore in the forest because we can lose control of the fire, and it can burn the forest,” said Kaparaí Tembé. This wasn’t always as much of a risk, he said. But deforestation from ranching and soy farming for animal feed across the state of Pará has removed moisture from the air, and now the dry season has become longer and drier — heightening the risk of uncontrolled wildfires. “We want to improve agriculture here, in one specific place, not keep burning fields and pushing nature back,” he said, setting his hoe on the ground and mopping the sweat from his brow. “We need to nurture the soil.” Earlier this year, the villagers treated the field with a powder made from grinding up limestone . It’s a technique to reduce the natural acidity of the Amazonian soil. Today Tembé and two other men are planting a different legume, called the pigeon pea, to add nitrogen to the soil. Later, as he walked back to the village, Tembé heard the raucous shriek of a scarlet macaw. “It’s a reminder of where I am,” he said. “The forest sustains us, the animals, the plants — we want to protect it.” ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

2023-09-09,Forests Won't Save Us From Climate Change,40,"Canadian wildfires have this year burned a land area larger than 104 of the world's 195 countries. The carbon dioxide released by them so far is estimated to be nearly 1.5 billion tons -- more than twice as much as Canada releases through transportation, electricity generation, heavy industry, construction and agriculture combined. In fact, it is more than the total emissions of more than 100 of the world's countries -- also combined.   But what is perhaps most striking about this year's fires is that despite their scale, they are merely a continuation of a dangerous trend: Every year since 2001, Canada's forests have emitted more carbon than they've absorbed. That is the central finding of a distressing analysis published last month by Barry Saxifrage in Canada's National Observer, ominously headlined ''Our forests have reached a tipping point.''  In fact, Saxifrage suggests, the tipping point was passed two decades ago, when the country's vast boreal forests, long a reliable ''sink'' for carbon, became instead a carbon ''source.'' In the 2000s, the effect was relatively small. But so far in the 2020s, Canada's forests have raised the country's total emissions by 50 percent.  ''There is this feel-good myth in Canada that our massive forest is offsetting some of our massive fossil fuel emissions,'' Saxifrage writes. ''That might have been true decades ago under our old, stable climate. But we've so weakened our forest -- through decades of business-as-usual industrial logging and fossil-fuelled climate shifts -- that it has switched to hemorrhaging COâ‚‚ instead of absorbing it.''  And, in theory at least, there is a lot more to hemorrhage: Saxifrage calculates that the 3.7 billion tons of carbon dioxide released by Canada's forests since 2001 are only a small fraction of the 100 billion tons stored in its trees and soil. The trends there are not encouraging. ''As extreme as this year's wildfire emissions have been,'' he says, ''they are just the latest escalation in a multi-decade flood of COâ‚‚ pouring out of Canada's 'managed' forests and forestry.''  This is not a simple story of wildfire and climate change but also of logging and forest management. Roughly speaking, when trees logged and trees replanted and regrown are in balance, a forest's ability to absorb carbon is stable. But beginning in the early 2000s, twice as much carbon-absorbing ability was destroyed through logging as was regenerated by replanting. In the decades since, the forest has largely stopped regenerating at all. In the 1990s Canadian forests were sequestering 165 million tons of carbon each year, 20 million more than the carbon-storage loss by logging. In the 2010s those same forests released 35 million more tons of carbon each year than they stored, not including the additional carbon released by logging. In the 2020s, that number has grown to 180 million tons released annually.  It all seems very Canadian. This is a country that promotes itself as a soft-spoken environmentalist leader, endowed with an endless forest landscape, but which nevertheless expands its pipelines, mocks the idea of leaving fossil fuels in the ground and routinely arrests climate activists. Canada is one of the few countries with more per capita emissions than the United States; in fact, its overall carbon production has actually grown since 1990, with the country producing more than 20 percent more carbon dioxide in 2019 than it did three decades earlier. This year, in the hellish midst of its worst fire season in modern history, Alberta actually hit pause on new renewable energy projects -- a pause that may derail 118 projects worth $33 billion.  But the story is much larger than Canada. Over the past decade or two, the world has really invested in the promise of forests as a climate solution, not just in the vaguely conceived ''billion trees'' or ''8 billion trees'' or ''trillion trees'' proposals endorsed by supporters as various as Marc Benioff and Donald Trump and the World Wildlife Fund, but in elaborate offset projects and carbon-credit markets designed to mitigate the effects of industrial emissions by planting enough trees to absorb all that carbon through photosynthesis.  These proposals always stretched the veneer of plausibility. Planting a trillion trees would mean essentially standing up a new Amazon, and offsetting a meaningful share of the world's fossil fuel emissions would require, it's been estimated, turning over a third of the planet's arable land to tree plantations. Offsetting all of them could require more than all the farmland on Earth. And because they eventually die, trees don't store carbon permanently, even when they don't combust and even when plantations are impeccably managed, which they rarely are.  But in recent months carbon offsetting has begun to look like an outright sham, with reports illustrating the emptiness of a vast majority of programs, particularly those that pay skimpily for poorly monitored projects in the developing world.  In one particularly scathing review in Science, researchers estimated that only 6 percent of 89 million carbon offsets would be associated with real carbon reductions. My colleague Peter Coy recently noted that the British bank Barclays suggested that the cost of offsets had fallen by more than three-quarters in just a year, a reflection of how little faith those buying them have in their reliability; voluntary carbon markets are shrinking for the first time in seven years out of growing skepticism. And last month in The Guardian, Patrick Greenfield speculated that carbon-credit speculators stood to lose many billions as the world came to realize that nearly all of the offsets being sold were ''worthless.'' A 2020 study showed that much-celebrated offsets sold for the Brazilian Amazon had barely slowed deforestation there. And a white paper published this summer by Joe Romm argued that the whole project of mitigating emissions through carbon offsets using forest replantation was ''unscalable, unjust and unfixable.''  I wouldn't be quite so fatalistic. Planting trees is still good, all else being equal, and can offer some climate benefits, if more limited ones than optimistic assessments suggest. And it is perhaps too cynical to judge offsets by the failures of the past. (If we judge all climate solutions by that standard, nearly all fail.) Even in a world of continued warming, some of the analyses show, forests can be managed better, deforestation more effectively combated and carbon more reliably stored. Logging practices can be reformed and deforestation in places like the Amazon can be reversed. In fact, under President Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva of Brazil, they already are, with rates of Amazon clearing down 34 percent from January to June.  But the world's most precious rainforest is still in quite a lot of trouble, as Daniel Grossman documented last month in Nature. A 2021 review of 590 plane flights documenting forest behavior found that carbon uptake was weakening across the region and that in the southeast Amazon, the forest had already become a net source of carbon dioxide -- raising alarm that the ecosystem may already be approaching a much-feared tipping point. Other studies have suggested that the rainforest as a whole may already have flipped from a carbon sink to a carbon source.  ''What we were predicting to happen perhaps in two or three decades is already taking place,'' one of those alarm-raising researchers told Grossman. And while policymakers discussing the transformation of the Amazon often emphasize the role of deforestation, which theoretically can be reversed, other research has suggested a larger impact of other warming-related changes, including fire. ''We are killing this ecosystem directly and indirectly,'' the climate scientist Luciana Gatti, who led the 2021 review, told Grossman. ''This is what scares me terribly and why it's affecting me so much when I come here. I'm observing the forest dying.''  Worrying trends have also been observed in the Congo basin. In less consequential places, such as the Czech Republic, countries have come to rely on forest uptake to manage their own carbon footprints -- only to see those forests turned into carbon sources by warming. Some forests elsewhere in the world may offer more encouraging trends. But according to UNESCO, forests in 10 World Heritage Sites have been net carbon emitters over the past two decades. And for those of us raised on generations of naturalist fables -- from ''The Lorax'' to ''The Overstory'' -- the recent fires in Canada may be a disorienting cultural tipping point. If we thought trees might save us, that is looking increasingly like a foolish bet. In many parts of the world, including some of the most densely forested, trees are not perfect allies for tree-huggers anymore, and forests no longer reliable climate partners. What was once the embodiment of environmental values now seems increasingly to be fighting for the other side. In some places, fighting harder each year. https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/06/opinion/columnists/forest-fires-climate-change.html Graphic   This article appeared in print on page A18. "

But we’ve so weakened our forest — through decades of business-as-usual industrial logging and fossil-fuelled climate shifts — that it has switched to hemorrhaging CO₂ instead of absorbing it.” And, in theory at least, there is a lot more to hemorrhage: Saxifrage calculates that the 3.7 billion tons of carbon dioxide released by Canada’s forests since 2001 are only a small fraction of the 100 billion tons stored in its trees and soil. The trends there are not encouraging. “As extreme as this year’s wildfire emissions have been,” he says, “they are just the latest escalation in a multi-decade flood of CO₂ pouring out of Canada’s ‘managed’ forests and forestry.” This is not a simple story of wildfire and climate change but also of logging and forest management. Roughly speaking, when trees logged and trees replanted and regrown are in balance, a forest’s ability to absorb carbon is stable. But beginning in the early 2000s, twice as much carbon-absorbing ability was destroyed through logging as was regenerated by replanting. In the decades since, the forest has largely stopped regenerating at all. In the 1990s Canadian forests were sequestering 165 million tons of carbon each year, 20 million more than the carbon-storage loss by logging. In the 2010s those same forests released 35 million more tons of carbon each year than they stored, not including the additional carbon released by logging. In the 2020s, that number has grown to 180 million tons released annually. It all seems very Canadian. This is a country that promotes itself as a soft-spoken environmentalist leader, endowed with an endless forest landscape, but which nevertheless expands its pipelines, mocks the idea of leaving fossil fuels in the ground and routinely arrests climate activists. Canada is one of the few countries with more per capita emissions than the United States; in fact, its overall carbon production has actually grown since 1990, with the country producing more than 20 percent more carbon dioxide in 2019 than it did three decades earlier. This year, in the hellish midst of its worst fire season in modern history, Alberta actually hit pause on new renewable energy projects — a pause that may derail 118 projects worth $33 billion. But the story is much larger than Canada. Over the past decade or two, the world has really invested in the promise of forests as a climate solution, not just in the vaguely conceived “billion trees” or “8 billion trees” or “trillion trees” proposals endorsed by supporters as various as Marc Benioff and Donald Trump and the World Wildlife Fund, but in elaborate offset projects and carbon-credit markets designed to mitigate the effects of industrial emissions by planting enough trees to absorb all that carbon through photosynthesis. These proposals always stretched the veneer of plausibility. Planting a trillion trees would mean essentially standing up a new Amazon, and offsetting a meaningful share of the world’s fossil fuel emissions would require, it’s been estimated, turning over a third of the planet’s arable land to tree plantations. Offsetting all of them could require more than all the farmland on Earth. And because they eventually die, trees don’t store carbon permanently, even when they don’t combust and even when plantations are impeccably managed, which they rarely are. But in recent months carbon offsetting has begun to look like an outright sham, with reports illustrating the emptiness of a vast majority of programs, particularly those that pay skimpily for poorly monitored projects in the developing world. In one particularly scathing review in Science, researchers estimated that only 6 percent of 89 million carbon offsets would be associated with real carbon reductions. My colleague Peter Coy recently noted that the British bank Barclays suggested that the cost of offsets had fallen by more than three-quarters in just a year, a reflection of how little faith those buying them have in their reliability; voluntary carbon markets are shrinking for the first time in seven years out of growing skepticism. And last month in The Guardian, Patrick Greenfield speculated that carbon-credit speculators stood to lose many billions as the world came to realize that nearly all of the offsets being sold were “worthless.” A 2020 study showed that much-celebrated offsets sold for the Brazilian Amazon had barely slowed deforestation there. And a white paper published this summer by Joe Romm argued that the whole project of mitigating emissions through carbon offsets using forest replantation was “unscalable, unjust and unfixable.” I wouldn’t be quite so fatalistic. Planting trees is still good, all else being equal, and can offer some climate benefits, if more limited ones than optimistic assessments suggest. And it is perhaps too cynical to judge offsets by the failures of the past. (If we judge all climate solutions by that standard, nearly all fail.) Even in a world of continued warming, some of the analyses show, forests can be managed better, deforestation more effectively combated and carbon more reliably stored. Logging practices can be reformed and deforestation in places like the Amazon can be reversed. In fact, under President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva of Brazil, they already are, with rates of Amazon clearing down 34 percent from January to June. But the world’s most precious rainforest is still in quite a lot of trouble, as Daniel Grossman documented last month in Nature. A 2021 review of 590 plane flights documenting forest behavior found that carbon uptake was weakening across the region and that in the southeast Amazon, the forest had already become a net source of carbon dioxide — raising alarm that the ecosystem may already be approaching a much-feared tipping point. Other studies have suggested that the rainforest as a whole may already have flipped from a carbon sink to a carbon source. “What we were predicting to happen perhaps in two or three decades is already taking place,” one of those alarm-raising researchers told Grossman. And while policymakers discussing the transformation of the Amazon often emphasize the role of deforestation, which theoretically can be reversed, other research has suggested a larger impact of other warming-related changes, including fire. “We are killing this ecosystem directly and indirectly,” the climate scientist Luciana Gatti, who led the 2021 review, told Grossman. “This is what scares me terribly and why it’s affecting me so much when I come here. I’m observing the forest dying.” Worrying trends have also been observed in the Congo basin. In less consequential places, such as the Czech Republic, countries have come to rely on forest uptake to manage their own carbon footprints — only to see those forests turned into carbon sources by warming. Some forests elsewhere in the world may offer more encouraging trends. But according to UNESCO, forests in 10 World Heritage Sites have been net carbon emitters over the past two decades. And for those of us raised on generations of naturalist fables — from “The Lorax” to “The Overstory” — the recent fires in Canada may be a disorienting cultural tipping point. If we thought trees might save us, that is looking increasingly like a foolish bet. In many parts of the world, including some of the most densely forested, trees are not perfect allies for tree-huggers anymore, and forests no longer reliable climate partners. What was once the embodiment of environmental values now seems increasingly to be fighting for the other side. In some places, fighting harder each year. This article appeared in print on page A18."
2023-08-08,"Brazil has 1.7 million Indigenous people, near double the count from prior census, government says",42,"BELEM, Brazil — The diminutive woman with a white feather headdress stood on the stage of the majestic colonial theater in Brazil’s Amazon on Monday and addressed the crowd. The woman, Minister of Indigenous People Sonia Guajajara, declared the day “the milestone of Indigenous participation,” then cited the national statistics institute’s freshly released census data that revealed the full scope of the nation’s Indigenous population: 1,693,535 people. While just 0.8% of Brazil’s population, the figure marks an 89% jump from the nation’s prior census, in 2010, due to greater willingness of people to recognize their roots and better survey methods, including access to previously unreachable villages, she said. The latter largely explains why their numbers within Indigenous territories grew 20%, to 622,066. “This a historic moment with that picture that the statistics agency has made,” she said on the eve of the two-day Amazon Summit in Belem. “It’s a historic moment of the restart of social, popular participation, and of the dialogue of our civil society with government.” The setting seemed symbolic: a theater displaying European décor -- French chandeliers, Italian marble busts and a massive painting across the ceiling depicting Greek deities. It was built during the rubber boom, with fortunes amassed with raw material from deep in the Amazon, and little care for what its extraction implied for local communities. There is no trace of them in the so-called Theater of Peace -- except on Monday many of their descendants could be found from the floor seats up to the balcony boxes, wearing tribal vestments. The gathering formed part of the events leading up to the Amazon Summit, during which presidents and representatives from the eight countries home to the world’s largest tropical rainforests will converge in this city to discuss how best to face up to its myriad challenges. In the so-called Amazon Dialogues during the days before the summit, there was surprisingly diverse participation of delegations from regions of the Amazon. Some boat trips to reach Belem took as long as five days. In some 400 events, representatives of Indigenous groups, riverine communities, fishermen and Afro-descendants discussed topics such as harassment from carbon credit companies, ending deforestation and illegal mining. One of their main demands was to cancel new oil projects in the region. Though the large majority came from Brazil, which holds two-thirds of the Amazon, there were also representatives from all eight countries. Most events took place in the same convention center where the presidents will meet starting on Tuesday. There, Indigenous Warao people from Venezuela sold crafts made of straw next to Kayapo Indigenous people painting their bodies with traditional designs. Riverine community stalls sold native honey, Brazil nuts and cassava flour. There were also protests against oil exploration near the mouth of the Amazon River. “You can clearly see that Brazil has a significant social problem to solve, a social problem left by the previous government,” said Colombian Indigenous leader Anitalia Pijachi Kuyuedo, referring to the administration of far-right former president Jair Bolsonaro. “There are many grievances, much pain, much anger, and you can feel the emotions in the words of those you speak with.” In an interview with The Associated Press on Monday, Guajajara, the minister, agreed that their anxiety has been palpable, but finally they have a forum. “There were six years of the complete silencing of civil society, and spaces for social participation were extinguished. People became very afraid to express themselves,"" Guajajara said. ""This is the first moment when society is once again engaging in dialogue with the federal government.” Brazil’s government had expected 10,000 attendees, but instead, 24,000 had arrived, according to Guajajara. Over 1,200 of them were camping in a private recreational park on Belem’s outskirts, with tents arranged in rows beside the stone trail gently winding through the jungle past waterslides coursing into man-made pools. Early Monday, they were rising to eat breakfast and prepare for the events of the day ahead. Some smiled at the sight of Chief Raoni Metuktire, a leader from the Amazon known throughout the world for defending the environment, sitting on a flimsy chair beside the trail and smoking a pipe. He shook hands and exchanged pleasantries with well-wishers. Diolina Krikati had traveled with about 40 others from her native Maranhao state. In an interview, she stressed the importance of the Amazon for generating the rains that irrigates crops in fields far from the forest – ensuring a livelihood not just for Indigenous people, but many non-Indigenous Brazilians, too. “(The summit) is like taking a moment to hear Indigenous people, and we need to be listened to. It’s a moment we need to speak about our needs, and our difficulties,” said Krikati, 31. Another attendee was Naldinho Kumaruara, 29, a spiritual leader wearing a crown of blue macaw feathers and a necklace made of snake bones, and who held a giant maraca in his hand. Kumaruara had come from his Indigenous territory – threatened by illegal logging and fishing, and predatory tourism – to Belem, the state capital. Already he had spoken with members of Para state’s secretariats of education and health who visited the park, as well also officials of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva’s general secretariat at the convention center. He sees this gathering, bringing together all nations that are stakeholders in the Amazon, as a step forward, and also one that has better likelihood to advance Indigenous causes than others, like the Free Land Camp in the capital Brasilia. “Now it is different, because we can speak for ourselves; It isn’t a white person coming and speaking for us. We are always involved, but we didn’t have a position to speak,” he said. “Today, we can speak.” Later that afternoon, Naldinho was among those in the crowd of Belem’s colonial theater. From an upper balcony, he watched as a group of adolescent Indigenous people stomped and sang on the stage. The interim president of Brazil’s statistics institute Cimar Azeredo announced the revised population statistic to the crowd, saying it had “helped to rediscover Brazil.” Their larger numbers means a greater share of the government resources can be earmarked for investment in Indigenous people’s health and education, Planning and Budget Minister Simone Tebet said at the event. And Guajajara stressed that it also means more money for security – a need she said was underscored just hours earlier, when three people of the Tembe ethnicity were shot. And in coming months, she told the crowd, the federal government will expel invaders from 32 Indigenous territories; her announcement was met by cheers and applause from the audience, plus the shaking of maracas. “Never again a Brazil without us!”"
2023-07-17,EU and Latin American leaders hold a summit hoping to rekindle relationship with long-lost friends,43,"BRUSSELS — Leaders from the European Union and Latin America gingerly hugged and huddled at the opening of their first summit of long-lost relatives in eight years. Monday's opening session didn't turn into a joyful reunion of long-lost friends. Latin American and Caribbean leaders brought century-old recriminations over colonialism and slavery across the Atlantic to the EU's headquarters in Brussels, and added current-day complaints that Europe still doesn't get how to treat former colonies as equal partners in the 21st century. “Most of Europe was, and still is, overwhelmingly the lopsided beneficiary in a relationship in which our Latin America, and our Caribbean, have been and are unequally yoked,” said St. Vincent and the Grenadines Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves, who holds the presidency of the 33-nation Community of Latin American and Caribbean States. European leaders acknowledged time and again that the exploitation of old had been fundamentally wrong, yet insisted that the challenges of today can only be tackled effectively when EU and Latin American countries do so together. “You have to realize that in the past, we didn’t pick up the phone when they had issues. So there is very serious irritation among a great many countries,“ Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said. “That we get this back in our face now is also proof that we, as Europe, sometimes acted a bit arrogantly.” The result was that long-stalled trade agreements — like a huge EU-Mercosur deal — will likely be no closer to resolution when the leaders wrap up their summit Tuesday. And despite weeks and months of preparation, a joint final statement was still in limbo less than a day before the closing of the meeting, highlighted by a dispute over whether to include a condemnation of Russia’s war in Ukraine. If something was on show, it was Central and South America's increased confidence, boosted by a huge injection of funds from China and the knowledge that their critical raw materials will become ever more vital as the EU seeks to end an excessive reliance on Beijing's rare mineral resources. Their last such encounter was in 2015, and since then the COVID-19 pandemic and Brazil's three-year departure from the 33-nation CELAC group had made the Atlantic Ocean separating the two sides seem wider. That view could not be dispelled despite pledges of friendship and EU commitments to spend 45 billion euros ($51 billion) on the partnerships over the next four years. Instead, divisions ranging from Russia's war in Ukraine to trade and deforestation gave extra spice to a meeting that will be considered a success simply if the participants agree to meet more frequently. Problems over including a reference to Russia in the summit statement were especially painful. The EU repeats its unwavering support for Ukraine almost daily. CELAC has member nations like Cuba and Venezuela whose views on Russia contrast with just about every EU nation and others that are neutrals in the war and point out other global conflicts that get less attention. While the EU pushes for strong words on the war, Gonsalves said that “this summit ought not to become another unhelpful battleground for discourses on this matter, which has been and continues to be addressed in other, more relevant fora.” The Netherlands, with France, Spain and Portugal, are EU nations with ties to the Americas going back centuries and that were long based on exploitative colonialism and slavery. And even since the nations wrested independence from European powers, trade has often been seen as a one-way street on which Europeans benefitted first and foremost. In the 21st century, China has steadily been pushing its influence and trade outreach deep into Latin America, and the EU acknowledges it has a geo-strategic battle on its hands. “A lot of European companies have lost ground,” said Parsifal D’Sola, executive director of the Center of Chinese-Latin American Investigations. Still, there is no overstating Europe's clout in Latin America, especially when it comes to the economy. Annual trade between the two blocs has increased 39% over the past decade to 369 billion euros ($414 billion). EU investment in the region stood at 693 billion euros ($777 billion), a 45% increase over the past decade. The EU already has trade deals with 27 of the 33 CELAC nations. It is also why the elephant in the room is the huge EU-Mercosur trade agreement between the EU bloc and Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay, which has foundered for five years just short of full ratification. Unlock that deal, and shared prosperity would be the reward for all involved, von der Leyen said. “All of this is within reach if we get the Mercosur, EU agreement across the finishing line. Our ambition is to settle any remaining differences as soon as possible.” Several EU nations have powerful farm lobbies that seek to keep competition from beef producing nations like Brazil and Argentina at bay. And after then Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro allowed Amazon deforestation to surge to a 15-year high, EU nations have been insisting on tougher environmental standards. “The conclusion of the Mercosur-European Union Agreement is a priority and must be based on mutual trust, not threats,"" said Brazil's current president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. ""The defense of environmental values, which we all share, cannot be an excuse for protectionism.” ___ Associated Press journalists Megan Janetsky in Mexico City, David Biller and Eléonore Hughes in Rio de Janeiro and Angela Charlton in Brussels contributed to this report."
2023-08-03,"Amazon Indigenous are leaving rainforest for cities, and finding urban poverty",44,"ATALAIA DO NORTE, Brazil — In 1976, Binan Tuku ventured to meet a Brazilian government's expedition on the banks of the Itui River in a remote area of the western Amazon rainforest. After some initial suspicion, he and his father accepted machetes and soap in what was the beginning of the Matis tribe's contact with the non-Indigenous world. Nearly 50 years after that meeting, documented in research by anthropologist Barbara Arisi, Tuku's own son Tumi is trying to carve out a living in the impoverished city of Atalaia do Norte. Instead of the traditional blowgun, Tumi held a pastry bag in his hands while working in a bakery, and his face bore none of the tattoos or piercings characteristic of the Matis. “In the village, the quality of education is not as good as in the city,” said Tumi, 24, who hopes to go to college to study medicine or journalism. “I want to engage with non-Indigenous people, learn from the challenges I face, and perhaps one day return to my village to share my understanding of how the city functions with the elders.” Thousands of Indigenous like Tumi are migrating to cities like Atalaia do Norte, some in pursuit of a better education and some drawn by a federal welfare benefit that can ensnare them in urban poverty. Their exodus is leaving villages to wither and raising concern that the world’s largest tropical rainforest — crucial to stemming the worst of climate change — will be left without its most effective guardians. About half of the 6,200 Indigenous people in the Javari Valley now live in urban centers, according to estimates by anthropologist Almério Alves Wadick. The Matis, one of several Indigenous peoples in the region, say almost half their 600 people now live in that city. That number is likely to grow, said Binin Matis, who leads the Matis Indigenous Association and takes the name of his people as his surname. Binin Matis said he fears the loss of his people's language and their exposure to drugs. “In the village, there are few people; it’s the older leaders. The youngsters are in the city,” he said. “No young Matis knows how to make a blowgun, an arrow. When the students go to the village for vacation, they don’t want to learn from the elders. They want to play soccer, have fun, and do things of the white man.” Bushe Matis, president of Univaja, the main association for Indigenous peoples in the Javari Valley, worries that the migration will lead to cuts in health and education programs and the potential revocation of Indigenous territories that might then be opened for mining and drilling. The Amazon came under heavy pressure under far-right President Jair Bolsonaro, who favored development. His single term saw a surge in illegal mining and deforestation hit a 15-year high. Univaja recently established its own surveillance team to guard against illegal fishermen, miners and loggers — a duty previously carried out by the villages. The initiative is crucial to protect isolated Indigenous who could be imperiled by something as simple as flu carried by invaders, Bushe said. Such tension appears to be behind last year’s killings of Indigenous expert Bruno Pereira and British journalist Dom Phillips. Pereira was in the Javari Valley assisting the creation of Univaja's surveillance system. Four fishermen and a businessman are under arrest in the killings. Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has sought to lessen pressure on the Amazon since defeating Bolsonaro in last year's election. He established a Ministry of Indigenous Affairs in part to safeguard Indigenous communities. A crucial part of that is improving education, a significant challenge in remote areas of the Amazon. Indigenous families also face hostility from non-Indigenous residents who see them as competition for limited resources, especially fish. “The Indians come here, the government doesn’t give them food, and they fish on our side,” said fisherman Antonio Alves, 46. “When one of us mistreats someone, it’s for our survival.” The Indigenous migration is being driven in part by a federal program created 20 years ago in Lula's first term. The Bolsa Familia program was launched to provide cash to families if they immunize their children and keep them in school. Tens of thousands of Indigenous families started frequenting cities to withdraw the benefit from state bank branches. There were dire consequences. Indigenous people unaccustomed to handling money sometimes pay more than they should for long boat trips or have their debit cards illegally retained by unscrupulous merchants as collateral for installment or credit purchases. In the city, they stay in precarious conditions, vulnerable to alcohol and disease. Often, the Bolsa Familia payout isn't enough to get them back home. “They conclude that it’s better to stay in the city, receiving this amount and putting it towards studying since there isn’t even a complete primary education in the village,” said Wadick, the anthropologist. Indigenous leaders say village schools are in shambles from poor maintenance and lack of oversight by governments. Many Indigenous teachers have been spending long periods in the city, neglecting their work. But the money isn't enough to cover life in the city, either. The minimum payment is $125 per month, plus small additions for pregnant women and for children depending on age. Indigenous people often compete against each other for poorly paying jobs like collecting garbage or sweeping streets. Many endure hunger. “We need clothing, to eat every day, to pay for electricity, and water bills. If all of that were free, we could sustain ourselves with $125,” said Tumi, who recently left the bakery to work for Univaja. The Ministry of Indigenous Peoples is seeking to rework parts of the program so Indigenous peoples don't have to travel as often to collect payment. Proposals include extending the withdrawal period for the money and flexible payment dates. Another major ministry goal is to improve education in Indigenous territories to reduce the incentive to leave. That's a daunting task with high costs for huge, remote and impoverished areas. Nelly Marubo, an anthropologist who is Indigenous, said her ideal is culturally adapted village schools where students have access to both Indigenous and non-Indigenous knowledge without needing to be in the city. But she was shocked by what she found when, after a five-year absence, she recently visited her native region deep in the Javari Valley to film a documentary about her life. “I always have in my mind lots of children and young people, but unfortunately, this time the visit was very sad,"" she said. ""I found an abandoned village with only four elderly women.” ___ Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

2024-01-22,"In Dark Times, I Told My Little Girl Stories",45,"I was nursing a 4-month-old baby when Jair Bolsonaro won Brazil's presidential election in 2018. It was a disaster, and I knew it right away. My daughter -- let's call her Potato -- kept on sucking while I shed tears over her head. Then I changed her into a rainbow onesie to indicate my displeasure with our future president, who once said he was ''proud to be homophobic.''   There was not much else I could do in my state of exhaustion and despair. But then, on one of those lonely nights of breastfeeding, I started to tell Potato random stories, just to feel less alone and to divert my sad thoughts. Little did I know that this, the simple act of telling tales, would see us through an unhinged far-right presidency and a devastating pandemic. In the toughest of times, it was a lifeline.  I remember the story that started everything: It was the tale of Damon and Pythias, which I had read somewhere and wanted to pass along. According to the myth, they were best friends who traveled to Syracuse, where Pythias did something unpleasant to King Dionysius and was sentenced to death. Pythias wanted to say goodbye to his family, so Damon offered himself as a hostage while Pythias settled his affairs. The king agreed. Nobody expected Pythias to return, but he did. Dionysius was so moved by the demonstration of friendship that he revoked the death sentence.  When I relayed the story's ending, I swear that my baby stopped feeding for a second, her big brown eyes looking at me inquiringly. After that, I decided to tell her any anecdote that came to mind and sounded even remotely child appropriate. This helped me a lot during late-night diaper changes, especially when I also needed to change Potato's soaked bed linens while distracting a cold, outraged baby.  She paid attention -- first to my intonations and then to the narrative, as she began to understand our language. I told her stories of the day I slipped off a boat, the day my bus broke down, the day I mistook apples for tomatoes, the day two buckets flew away through our window, whatever. She loved the story of a friend who was stung by a bee and continued to play a recreational volleyball match with a swollen foot; it's graphic, it's heroic, it's fun.  A little more than a year later, when Potato was a toddler learning to walk and talk, Covid-19 reached the country. By then, I was telling her stories about the environment, Indigenous tribes, the Amazon rainforest and the soaring deforestation rates under Mr. Bolsonaro's watch. Then we began to chat about pathogens, masks, vaccines and science denialists -- like the leader of our country, who aimed for herd immunity and worked against vaccines.  Sharing stories was our way of getting through the long days and nights of social isolation. She showed a special interest in the plot of a novel by Ivan Goncharov, the 19th-century Russian novelist, she picked up from my bedside table. The protagonist, Ilya Ilyich Oblomov, refused to leave his bedroom; for him to move from his bed to a chair takes dozens of pages. (He complied with quarantine before it was cool.)  As she developed her language skills, Potato started to ask difficult questions -- about why the rich could continue to drain our natural resources and why Mr. Bolsonaro hadn't been arrested yet. I tried to convey a hopeful message about the future, but sometimes my despondency was hard to hide. On the other hand, I learned that telling stories to her was a way of thinking out loud and calming my anxieties. This was good for both of us: I got a therapeutic break from my neurosis, and she got a story.  Since Potato didn't have many true stories of her own to share and the outside world was a mess, we often resorted to fiction. All the time, she asked me to tell ''wrong things'' (fictional stories) that were ''long and difficult to understand'' (meaning many characters and plot twists). Sometimes she interrupted me to say: ''No, another one! A story without people.''  She intervened in everything -- the plot, the genre, the dialogue, the characters. She demanded certain props and scenarios. ''Now I want a sad story with Chico Bento,'' she asked one day, referring to a character from a Brazilian comic strip. ''And he sings!'' Recurring cast members in her stories included Greta Thunberg, Oblomov, the sisters Bingo and Bluey (from the Australian animated series ''Bluey''), Mario and Luigi (from the ''Super Mario'' franchise) and Luna (from the Brazilian animated series ''Earth to Luna!'').  In late 2022, Mr. Bolsonaro was voted out of office, defeated by Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. I told my daughter about Mr. Lula's imprisonment, his release, the annulment of his convictions and his comeback as president. Now that's a story. I told her about Mr. Lula's dog, a female black mutt named Resistance who went from living on the streets outside Mr. Lula's prison to the presidential palace. Potato loved that part.  Last year, with Mr. Bolsonaro and Covid-19 out of our lives -- well, sort of -- we could finally concentrate more on experiencing new stories rather than just telling them. Depression, my own faithful black mutt, still follows me around, but I have found more ways to keep it at a certain distance. A good night's sleep is a nice way to start. Things seem lighter.  Potato is now a 5-year-old who knows how to read, write and craft a compelling narrative. A while ago, we were coming home from school when she decided to perform a story inside the crowded bus. (I told her to lower her voice, to little avail.) At one point we were all ''in a very deep cave with a giant, a chicken and a huge ice cream.'' The lady next to us couldn't stop laughing, especially when the plot twist came. We got off at the penultimate stop, so most passengers didn't hear the end, sadly.  Our storytelling has developed in tandem, each of us encouraged by the other. In the past year, I drafted a novel about depression, motherhood, Greek myths and creative writing. Potato wrote and illustrated five books before getting bored: ''Things I Like,'' ''Things I Don't Like,'' ''The Long Dress,'' ''The Crazy Birthday Book'' and ''The Pineapple Singer.'' Life is fuller for both of us: She's been learning to swim and I've been playing beach volleyball, risking the occasional bee sting.  She's been teaching me how to finish a complex narrative when you are despairing and clueless about how to move on: She just appears, flying, as a plot resolution device. It's called a Potato ex machina. It works every time.  The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor. We'd like to hear what you think about this or any of our articles.

Binin Matis said he fears the loss of his people's language and their exposure to drugs. “In the village, there are few people; it’s the older leaders. The youngsters are in the city,” he said. “No young Matis knows how to make a blowgun, an arrow. When the students go to the village for vacation, they don’t want to learn from the elders. They want to play soccer, have fun, and do things of the white man.” Bushe Matis, president of Univaja, the main association for Indigenous peoples in the Javari Valley, worries that the migration will lead to cuts in health and education programs and the potential revocation of Indigenous territories that might then be opened for mining and drilling. The Amazon came under heavy pressure under far-right President Jair Bolsonaro, who favored development. His single term saw a surge in illegal mining and deforestation hit a 15-year high. Univaja recently established its own surveillance team to guard against illegal fishermen, miners and loggers — a duty previously carried out by the villages. The initiative is crucial to protect isolated Indigenous who could be imperiled by something as simple as flu carried by invaders, Bushe said. Such tension appears to be behind last year’s killings of Indigenous expert Bruno Pereira and British journalist Dom Phillips. Pereira was in the Javari Valley assisting the creation of Univaja's surveillance system. Four fishermen and a businessman are under arrest in the killings. Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has sought to lessen pressure on the Amazon since defeating Bolsonaro in last year's election. He established a Ministry of Indigenous Affairs in part to safeguard Indigenous communities. A crucial part of that is improving education, a significant challenge in remote areas of the Amazon. Indigenous families also face hostility from non-Indigenous residents who see them as competition for limited resources, especially fish. “The Indians come here, the government doesn’t give them food, and they fish on our side,” said fisherman Antonio Alves, 46. “When one of us mistreats someone, it’s for our survival.” The Indigenous migration is being driven in part by a federal program created 20 years ago in Lula's first term. The Bolsa Familia program was launched to provide cash to families if they immunize their children and keep them in school. Tens of thousands of Indigenous families started frequenting cities to withdraw the benefit from state bank branches. There were dire consequences. Indigenous people unaccustomed to handling money sometimes pay more than they should for long boat trips or have their debit cards illegally retained by unscrupulous merchants as collateral for installment or credit purchases. In the city, they stay in precarious conditions, vulnerable to alcohol and disease. Often, the Bolsa Familia payout isn't enough to get them back home. “They conclude that it’s better to stay in the city, receiving this amount and putting it towards studying since there isn’t even a complete primary education in the village,” said Wadick, the anthropologist. Indigenous leaders say village schools are in shambles from poor maintenance and lack of oversight by governments. Many Indigenous teachers have been spending long periods in the city, neglecting their work. But the money isn't enough to cover life in the city, either. The minimum payment is $125 per month, plus small additions for pregnant women and for children depending on age. Indigenous people often compete against each other for poorly paying jobs like collecting garbage or sweeping streets. Many endure hunger. “We need clothing, to eat every day, to pay for electricity, and water bills. If all of that were free, we could sustain ourselves with $125,” said Tumi, who recently left the bakery to work for Univaja. The Ministry of Indigenous Peoples is seeking to rework parts of the program so Indigenous peoples don't have to travel as often to collect payment. Proposals include extending the withdrawal period for the money and flexible payment dates. Another major ministry goal is to improve education in Indigenous territories to reduce the incentive to leave. That's a daunting task with high costs for huge, remote and impoverished areas. Nelly Marubo, an anthropologist who is Indigenous, said her ideal is culturally adapted village schools where students have access to both Indigenous and non-Indigenous knowledge without needing to be in the city. But she was shocked by what she found when, after a five-year absence, she recently visited her native region deep in the Javari Valley to film a documentary about her life. “I always have in my mind lots of children and young people, but unfortunately, this time the visit was very sad,"" she said. ""I found an abandoned village with only four elderly women.” ___ Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

2024-01-01,How Telling Stories to My Daughter Got Me Through the Darkest Times; Guest Essay,47,"I was nursing a 4-month-old baby when Jair Bolsonaro won Brazil’s presidential election in 2018. It was a disaster, and I knew it right away. My daughter — let’s call her Potato — kept on sucking while I shed tears over her head. Then I changed her into a rainbow onesie to indicate my displeasure with our future president, who once said he was “proud to be homophobic.” There was not much else I could do in my state of exhaustion and despair. But then, on one of those lonely nights of breastfeeding, I started to tell Potato random stories, just to feel less alone and to divert my sad thoughts. Little did I know that this, the simple act of telling tales, would see us through an unhinged far-right presidency and a devastating pandemic. In the toughest of times, it was a lifeline. I remember the story that started everything: It was the tale of Damon and Pythias, which I had read somewhere and wanted to pass along. According to the myth, they were best friends who traveled to Syracuse, where Pythias did something unpleasant to King Dionysius and was sentenced to death. Pythias wanted to say goodbye to his family, so Damon offered himself as a hostage while Pythias settled his affairs. The king agreed. Nobody expected Pythias to return, but he did. Dionysius was so moved by the demonstration of friendship that he revoked the death sentence. When I relayed the story’s ending, I swear that my baby stopped feeding for a second, her big brown eyes looking at me inquiringly. After that, I decided to tell her any anecdote that came to mind and sounded even remotely child appropriate. This helped me a lot during late-night diaper changes, especially when I also needed to change Potato’s soaked bed linens while distracting a cold, outraged baby. She paid attention — first to my intonations and then to the narrative, as she began to understand our language. I told her stories of the day I slipped off a boat, the day my bus broke down, the day I mistook apples for tomatoes, the day two buckets flew away through our window, whatever. She loved the story of a friend who was stung by a bee and continued to play a recreational volleyball match with a swollen foot; it’s graphic, it’s heroic, it’s fun. A little more than a year later, when Potato was a toddler learning to walk and talk, Covid-19 reached the country. By then, I was telling her stories about the environment, Indigenous tribes, the Amazon rainforest and the soaring deforestation rates under Mr. Bolsonaro’s watch. Then we began to chat about pathogens, masks, vaccines and science denialists — like the leader of our country, who aimed for herd immunity and worked against vaccines. Sharing stories was our way of getting through the long days and nights of social isolation. She showed a special interest in the plot of a novel by Ivan Goncharov, the 19th-century Russian novelist, she picked up from my bedside table. The protagonist, Ilya Ilyich Oblomov, refused to leave his bedroom; for him to move from his bed to a chair takes dozens of pages. (He complied with quarantine before it was cool.) As she developed her language skills, Potato started to ask difficult questions — about why the rich could continue to drain our natural resources and why Mr. Bolsonaro hadn’t been arrested yet. I tried to convey a hopeful message about the future, but sometimes my despondency was hard to hide. On the other hand, I learned that telling stories to her was a way of thinking out loud and calming my anxieties. This was good for both of us: I got a therapeutic break from my neurosis, and she got a story. Since Potato didn’t have many true stories of her own to share and the outside world was a mess, we often resorted to fiction. All the time, she asked me to tell “wrong things” (fictional stories) that were “long and difficult to understand” (meaning many characters and plot twists). Sometimes she interrupted me to say: “No, another one! A story without people.” She intervened in everything — the plot, the genre, the dialogue, the characters. She demanded certain props and scenarios. “Now I want a sad story with Chico Bento,” she asked one day, referring to a character from a Brazilian comic strip. “And he sings!” Recurring cast members in her stories included Greta Thunberg, Oblomov, the sisters Bingo and Bluey (from the Australian animated series “Bluey”), Mario and Luigi (from the “Super Mario” franchise) and Luna (from the Brazilian animated series “Earth to Luna!”). In late 2022, Mr. Bolsonaro was voted out of office, defeated by Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. I told my daughter about Mr. Lula’s imprisonment, his release, the annulment of his convictions and his comeback as president. Now that’s a story. I told her about Mr. Lula’s dog, a female black mutt named Resistance who went from living on the streets outside Mr. Lula’s prison to the presidential palace. Potato loved that part. Last year, with Mr. Bolsonaro and Covid-19 out of our lives — well, sort of — we could finally concentrate more on experiencing new stories rather than just telling them. Depression, my own faithful black mutt, still follows me around, but I have found more ways to keep it at a certain distance. A good night’s sleep is a nice way to start. Things seem lighter. Potato is now a 5-year-old who knows how to read, write and craft a compelling narrative. A while ago, we were coming home from school when she decided to perform a story inside the crowded bus. (I told her to lower her voice, to little avail.) At one point we were all “in a very deep cave with a giant, a chicken and a huge ice cream.” The lady next to us couldn’t stop laughing, especially when the plot twist came. We got off at the penultimate stop, so most passengers didn’t hear the end, sadly. Our storytelling has developed in tandem, each of us encouraged by the other. In the past year, I drafted a novel about depression, motherhood, Greek myths and creative writing. Potato wrote and illustrated five books before getting bored: “Things I Like,” “Things I Don’t Like,” “The Long Dress,” “The Crazy Birthday Book” and “The Pineapple Singer.” Life is fuller for both of us: She’s been learning to swim and I’ve been playing beach volleyball, risking the occasional bee sting. She’s been teaching me how to finish a complex narrative when you are despairing and clueless about how to move on: She just appears, flying, as a plot resolution device.

2023-12-01,"Top world leaders talk of climate crisis at UN summit. They say they must act on fossil fuels, war",48,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Dozens of world leaders said they know the planet's dangerously overheating and they are trying to keep it from getting worse. The next step is to turn their soaring rhetoric voiced at the beginning of the United Nations climate conference into action. In the first of two days of the two-week summit, presidents, prime ministers and royals from nations rich and poor trotted up to the microphone Friday to lay out commitments to reduce how much their countries spew heat-trapping gases and asked their colleagues to do better. Critics, advocacy groups and even some leaders themselves said that the words of promise must be followed by deals hammered out by diplomats in the coming days. The conference, called COP28, is a who's who of about 150 of Earth's top decision-makers — except the two most powerful men: Presidents Joe Biden and Xi Jinping of the United States and China. The leaders of the two most carbon-polluting nations were glaringly absent. In a fire-and-brimstone kickoff of the parade of VIPs, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, fresh from melting glaciers in Antarctica and Nepal, said ""Earth's vital signs are failing"" and told leaders, “you can prevent planetary crash and burn.” He referred to inequality and conflicts, mentioning the return of fighting between Israel and Hamas on Friday. “Climate chaos is fanning the flames of injustice,” Guterres said. “Global heating is busting budgets, ballooning food prices, upending energy markets, and feeding a cost-of-living crisis. Climate action can flip the switch.” Jordan's King Abdullah said it was impossible to separate climate change from the war in Gaza. “Climate threats magnify the devastation of war,’’ the king said. “Let’s be inclusive of the most vulnerable Palestinians severely impacted by the war.” Still, Kenya President William Ruto said, ""climate change stands out by far as the defining issue of our era."" He joined many leaders who repeated the major goals of conference organizers to triple renewable energy and double energy efficiency. Those goals aren't controversial, but what to do about fossil fuels is. Guterres, a long-time critic of oil, gas and coal use that is causing climate change, fired his strongest shots yet against the industry, which includes COP28 host country United Arab Emirates, saying, “we cannot save a burning planet with a firehose of fossil fuels.” In a direct challenge to fossil fuel-aligned nations, the U.N. chief said the only way to limit warming to the goal set in 2015 in Paris — 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) since the start of the industrial era — requires eliminating oil, coal and gas use. “Not reduce, not abate. Phase out,"" he said. The conference president on Friday issued a document calling for a “phase-down” of fossil fuels, which experts say is less than a phase-out. But 106 nations in Africa, Europe, the Caribbean and in the Pacific signed a statement calling for a full exit. It's up to the more than 190 countries in the talks to come up with an agreement everyone can be happy with, said conference Director General Majid Al Suwaidi. That exposed the traditional fault lines between rich, industrialized countries and much of the developing world — and between pledges and political action. “Although we’ve made great progress together, the world is just not moving fast enough,"" said British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. He said “major emitters” must speed up delivery of their promises, ""and we must address the disconnect between lofty rhetoric on stages like this and the reality of people’s lives around the world,” he added. Sunak has approved new North Sea oil drilling and pushed further into the future a planned ban in Britain on sales of new gas and diesel cars. He says he's still committed to the U.K.'s goal of reaching net zero carbon emissions by 2050, but is taking a “pragmatic” approach that does not unfairly hit taxpayers — ahead of a possible election next year. Many developing-world leaders pledged to do more to advance solar power and other renewable energies, while calling for technology transfer, help in building resilience against climate disasters and sharing of “best practices” — as Zambian President Hakainde Hichilema put it — from “the North” to help continents like Africa benefit too. President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of Brazil, home to most of the Amazon rainforest, said “the planet is tired of climate agreements that were not fulfilled” and said he's had enough of “eloquent and empty speeches.” Lula called for climate justice for poorer nations that didn’t cause the problem and railed against $2 trillion spent on weapons last year when the money should be spent on fighting hunger and climate change. He said Brazil will stop Amazon deforestation by 2030. Many leaders, including France's Emmanuel Macron and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, took aim at coal. The Japanese leader pledged ending new construction at home of unabated coal-fired power plants, in a clearer show of determination than in the past toward achieving net-zero. While Japan has faced criticism for not setting a timeline for eliminating coal power plants, the country has achieved 20% emissions reduction and is on target to lower that to 46% by 2030. Kishida said Japan will issue the world’s first government transition bond with international certification. Japanese officials say the country aims to fund 20 trillion yen ($135 billion) over the next 10 years to promote private sector investment worth 150 trillion yen ($1 trillion). Xi and Biden are sitting out this COP, just weeks after announcing a bilateral agreement to help cut down on methane emissions. Their deputies, U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris and China's First Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang, are attending instead. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi proposed that the South Asian nation, which is the world’s most populous country and third biggest carbon-polluting nation, host the climate talks in 2028. The Indian leader also announced that his country will spearhead the green credits program, which will likely allow individuals and corporations to purchase credits on a dedicated website yet to be setup to offset their emissions. Many of the leaders represent countries hard hit by floods, storms, drought and heat waves worsened by climate change from the burning of coal, oil and gas. Those include the islands nations of Palau and the Maldives as well as leaders of Pakistan and Libya, which have been devastated by recent floods that killed thousands. Host country United Arab Emirates continued to spend money to show its green credentials, including establishing a $30 billion investment program for climate-friendly technology. The UAE, which also pledged $100 million in a climate damage compensation fund Thursday, added pledges of $300 million in other climate spending on Friday. ___ Associated Press journalists David Keyton in Dubai, UAE; Sibi Arasu in Bengaluru, India; Jill Lawless in London and Mari Yamaguchi in Tokyo contributed to this report. ___ Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

2023-06-08,The Terrible Beauty of Richard Mosse’s Portrait of the Amazon; Critic’s Notebook,49,"The artist wanted to photograph orchids but ended up making “Broken Spectre,” a film about the destruction of the rainforest — his most powerful work yet. In 2018, the artist Richard Mosse was understandably weary. He had spent most of the last decade in places torn by conflict and civil unrest. In the early 2010s, the Irish-born New York-based artist had worked for five years in the Democratic Republic of Congo, photographing and filming the humanitarian disaster that has claimed millions of lives and displaced millions more. That project led to another video and photographic series focusing on the European refugee crisis unfolding around the Mediterranean. Before that, he had embedded with the U.S. Army in Iraq. “I was exhausted,” Mosse said recently, as he recounted the events that led to his latest film installation, “Broken Spectre,” filmed in the Amazon rainforest from 2018 to 2021. “I thought I’d put the superego aside, and just enjoy the simple pleasures of photography. This project essentially began with portraits of orchids.” Mosse booked himself into a remote ecolodge in the Ecuadorean cloud forest, and began photographing plants, lichens, mycelium and insects with a macro lens. He found that many organisms phosphoresce under ultraviolet light, so he created dramatic Technicolor images of the teeming biodiversity on the forest floor. Then in the summer of 2019, images appeared in the news media about fires burning across the Amazon Basin. Mosse called up Trevor Tweeten, the cinematographer who has contributed to Mosse’s film projects since 2008, and they flew down, Tweeten said, “to see what it was about.” “Broken Spectre,” an epic film made from four conjoined projections that total 70 feet across, testifies to the calamitous destruction of the Amazon rainforest: the deliberate burning, the tree-felling, the industrial-scale agriculture, the mineral extraction and the displacement of Indigenous peoples that climate scientists believe is fast approaching a tipping-point from which there may be no return. Part photojournalism, part nature doc, part cinéma vérité, part Western, the film defies categorization. It includes close-ups of plants and vast panoramas shot from helicopters. It features farmers and their families; abattoir workers; wealthy landowners; miners; Indigenous people. With an immersive and often thunderous soundtrack by the experimental composer Ben Frost, the film is both visceral and abstract, beautiful and horrifying. “Broken Spectre” is Mosse’s most powerful and consequential work yet. Mosse, 43, had flown to San Francisco for the film’s U.S. premiere at a new exhibition space, 1201 Minnesota Street, following its presentation in London and in Victoria, Australia, in 2022. (In August it will be included in Converge45, the Portland Biennial.) The invitation to exhibit “Broken Spectre” in San Francisco came from the philanthropists Andy and Deborah Rappaport, founders of the Minnesota Street Project Foundation in the city’s Dogpatch neighborhood. A short walk away, Mosse was opening a simultaneous exhibition at Altman Siegel, his San Francisco gallery: “Occidental,” a group of works including “drone maps” made from tessellated aerial photographs during his time in the Amazon. “Seventy-five percent of the entire Amazon is so degraded by processes of deforestation that we’re now very close to the point where there’s an automatic dieback, and the forest can’t generate its own rain,” Mosse explained. “So it stops being rainforest. Once that happens, it turns quite quickly to savanna.” The enormity of such a chain of events — and their consequences for our planet’s future — challenges comprehension. As he relayed this information, Mosse, who has boyish dimples and an affable manner, did not try to dramatize it, or impress me with its gravity. He must have recited the same facts 100 times. He knows that statistics alone are not sufficient. “We’ve got all the reports, we have the quantitative data, but we still don’t have the adequate image, the qualitative storytelling,” he said. That’s where his art comes in. Mosse has long been concerned with making the unseen visible. In Congo, he used Kodak Aerochrome infrared film to photograph paramilitary rebels against the lush tropical landscape, transforming green tones into alarming shades of hot pink. The culminating film installation, “Enclave,” was presented by Ireland at the Venice Biennale in 2013. For “Incoming,” his three-channel video about the migrant crisis, first shown in 2017, he used a military-grade thermal imaging camera to photograph Syrian battlefields and European refugee camps from many miles away. Mosse is drawn to what he calls “aggravated media” — media whose technological or social histories are entwined, problematically, with what they represent. Aerochrome film, for example, was developed to discover camouflaged soldiers in World War II. Mosse’s thermal imaging camera is internationally classified as a weapon. The multispectral cameras that Mosse and Tweeten used for parts of “Broken Spectre” and for Mosse’s “drone maps” are able to see environmental conditions invisible to the naked eye. Lurid colors correspond to wavelengths both above and below the range of human vision. This technology helps scientists assess the damage done to the Amazon, but it is also commonly used by Brazilian farmers to identify how best to exploit their land. The Amazon can be a dangerous place — and was especially so during the administration of the former Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro, when regulations safeguarding the environment were loosened, or not enforced. One recent study estimated that 99 percent of deforestation in the Amazon is illegal, much of it connected to organized crime. The remote settlements that have sprung up near gold mines are lawless, violent places, inhabited mainly by young miners who are paid in gold and supplied with drugs by cartels. One day, in June 2021, Mosse read reports of a skirmish between Indigenous Yanomami villagers and garimpeiros, or illegal gold miners. The miners brought with them diseases, including malaria, which was sickening the villagers’ children. Young Yanomami women were coerced into prostitution, bringing more disease. The gold mining process involves the use of mercury, traces of which get washed into the river, harming the wildlife and entering the villagers’ food supply. “They used to live in paradise,” Mosse said. “All of a sudden they’re living in hell.” Mosse read about how the villagers fastened a wire across the river, blocking a boat loaded with valuable diesel on its way to the garimpeiro settlement. They seized the diesel and burned it. The garimpeiros fired back, and several villagers were killed. That night and many nights later, garimpeiros (or the cartels protecting them) fired automatic weapons into the villagers’ huts. Mosse hurriedly booked flights to Boa Vista, in northern Brazil. From there, he chartered a Cessna aircraft to take him to the village. Traveling with him were his “fixer-translator,” Alessandro Falco, and the Yanomami’s regional leader, Júnior Hekurari Yanomami. In the most memorable and impactful scene of the film, one of the villagers, a woman named Adneia, directly addresses the camera. At first, her fury is aimed at the Brazilian president: “Bolsonaro, you parasite. You keep sending the gold miners to our land. It’s sickening. It’s disgusting, you foul man.” Her subtitled diatribe continues for more than five minutes. (Tweeten’s 35 mm film camera had to be reloaded twice, so the film intermittently cuts to black.) As her voice cracks with emotion, it becomes clear that Adneia’s entreaties are no longer meant for Bolsonaro, but for the white filmmakers before her — and by extension, us, the viewers. “You say you’re here to support us,” she chides. “Don’t say that for nothing.” For a long time, Mosse said he struggled with Adneia’s mandate. “We’re just artists!” he said. “The best we can do — the only thing we can do really — is what we’re good at, which is to communicate to as many people as we can.” Mosse now describes “Broken Spectre” as his first activist film. When “Broken Spectre” was shown in London, Mosse recalls, John Kerry, President Biden’s climate envoy, saw the film, and soon after Mosse received an email from Kerry’s office requesting an online screening link. The next day, Kerry was to meet with Brazil’s new president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, and the minister of environment and climate change, Marina Silva, and he wanted to share the film with them. Mosse says he has no idea if “Broken Spectre” was in any way responsible, but soon after, the Brazilian military began stopping the garimpeiros mining in the area. “That’s what Adneia was asking for!” Mosse says. “She was asking us to tell the senior level of U.S. government which we’ve somehow managed to do. For me, that’s just the power of art.” Broken Spectre Through June 30 at 1201 Minnesota Street, San Francisco, minnesotastreetproject.org.

Mosse read about how the villagers fastened a wire across the river, blocking a boat loaded with valuable diesel on its way to the garimpeiro settlement. They seized the diesel and burned it. The garimpeiros fired back, and several villagers were killed. That night and many nights later, garimpeiros (or the cartels protecting them) fired automatic weapons into the villagers' huts.  Mosse hurriedly booked flights to Boa Vista, in northern Brazil. From there, he chartered a Cessna aircraft to take him to the village. Traveling with him were his ''fixer-translator,'' Alessandro Falco, and the Yanomami's regional leader, Júnior Hekurari Yanomami.  In the most memorable and impactful scene of the film, one of the villagers, a woman named Adneia, directly addresses the camera. At first, her fury is aimed at the Brazilian president: ''Bolsonaro, you parasite. You keep sending the gold miners to our land. It's sickening. It's disgusting, you foul man.''  Her subtitled diatribe continues for more than five minutes. (Tweeten's 35 mm film camera had to be reloaded twice, so the film intermittently cuts to black.) As her voice cracks with emotion, it becomes clear that Adneia's entreaties are no longer meant for Bolsonaro, but for the white filmmakers before her -- and by extension, us, the viewers.  ''You say you're here to support us,'' she chides. ''Don't say that for nothing.''  For a long time, Mosse said he struggled with Adneia's mandate. ''We're just artists!'' he said. ''The best we can do -- the only thing we can do really -- is what we're good at, which is to communicate to as many people as we can.''  Mosse now describes ''Broken Spectre'' as his first activist film.  When ''Broken Spectre'' was shown in London, Mosse recalls, John Kerry, President Biden's climate envoy, saw the film, and soon after Mosse received an email from Kerry's office requesting an online screening link. The next day, Kerry was to meet with Brazil's new president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, and the minister of environment and climate change, Marina Silva, and he wanted to share the film with them.  Mosse says he has no idea if ''Broken Spectre'' was in any way responsible, but soon after, the Brazilian military began stopping the garimpeiros mining in the area. ''That's what Adneia was asking for!'' Mosse says. ''She was asking us to tell the senior level of U.S. government which we've somehow managed to do. For me, that's just the power of art.''

2024-01-23,Jane Goodall Says 2024 is the ‘Most Consequential Voting Year’,51," “Every vote matters, more this year than perhaps any time in history.” When I caught up with Jane Goodall in 2019, she was calling on consumers and businesses to make responsible choices and protect the natural world.  Now she is telling people something much more simple: vote.  The celebrated primatologist thinks governments around the globe are not working hard enough to combat climate change. And in a year when more than 40 countries — including the United States, India and South Africa — will be electing their leaders, Goodall is telling anyone who will listen that the health of Earth itself is on the ballot. “Half of the population of the planet is going to be voting,” she said on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos last week. “This year could be the most consequential voting year in terms of the fate of our planet.” As my colleague Manuela Andreoni wrote last week, the leaders elected this year will face consequential choices on energy policy, deforestation and emissions reductions. In the United States, Republicans are planning to undo environmental regulations if former president Donald J. Trump wins re-election. In Mexico, the favorite to win the presidency in June is Claudia Sheinbaum, a climate scientist who is now mayor of Mexico City and has vowed to take action to reduce emissions. Goodall noted that the outcomes of national elections can have profound and immediate impacts. She pointed to Brazil, where two years ago, voters ousted the far-right leader, Jair Bolsonaro, and brought back President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. Overnight, Lula abandoned Bolsonaro’s laissez-faire approach to environmental regulation and redoubled efforts to protect the Amazon rainforest.  Similar swings in policy will reverberate around the world as people go to the polls in the months to come, Goodall said: “Every vote matters, more this year than perhaps any time in history.” ‘The wealthy are being hit’ Goodall refrained from endorsing specific candidates.  But she believes that as extreme weather batters every corner of the globe, more voters were coming to understand that climate policies matter.  “When climate change began to make itself known, it was Bangladesh and the poorer countries that were suffering,” she said. “Now the wealthy are being hit. The industrialized countries are being hit where it hurts them economically.” In the United States alone last year, there were 28 storms, wildfires or other disasters that each cost at least $1 billion or more in damages, my colleague Christopher Flavelle reported this month. “There are floods in New York, floods in Britain, floods in several parts of Europe, unprecedented heat waves killing people in France,” Goodall told me. “It has changed.” Yet in what is expected to be a tight race between President Biden and Trump, climate is not one of the dominant issues of the campaign. Inasmuch as it is a factor, it is often invoked by activists who believe the Biden administration is not doing enough to curb emissions, or by Trump with promises to expand oil and gas drilling. Goodall also expressed hope that companies could do more to reduce emissions. Just as voters might respond to climate crises at the polls, she said corporations might begin funneling their lobbying dollars toward candidates who prioritized climate issues. “I’m hoping that because companies are being hit economically, some of them will think, ‘Well, we better put a bit more money into the right politicians,’” she said. ‘An all of the above moment’ Goodall, who turns 90 in a few months, was in Davos talking up her efforts to educate young people about the plight of the natural world — and to bend the ear of the policymakers and C.E.O.s who sought her out for selfies. Elections, she said, matter to the degree that they help preserve the natural world.  “The ecosystem is this tapestry of interconnected plants and animals, and each single one has a role to play,” she said. “When a species becomes extinct, it’s like pulling a thread. And if enough threads are pulled, the tapestry hangs in tatters. The ecosystem will collapse.” Goodall, who spent decades living in the jungle studying chimpanzees, is not dogmatic in her approach to fighting climate change. “We need the technology,” she said. “We need transfer to renewable energy. We need to stop subsidizing fossil fuel companies. We must think about human population with its cattle. It’s an all-of-the-above moment.” But she said those policies will only be enacted by leaders who appreciate the gravity of the crises facing planet Earth. “We’ve got to get the message out there for people to understand, and then they’ll vote in the right way,” she said. “Then they’ll understand how important it is for their children, and their children’s children.” Geoexchange students: Colleges drill for clean energy To slash carbon emissions, a growing number of colleges and universities are digging deep, using underground pipes to heat and cool their buildings without burning fossil fuels. Princeton University is spending hundreds of millions of dollars on a new system that will heat and cool buildings using a process known as geoexchange. It starts with a big, muddy mess, as thousands of boreholes are drilled around campus. But the holes will eventually be undetectable, and able to perform an impressive sleight of hand. During hot months, heat drawn from Princeton’s buildings will be stored in thick pipes deep underground; in the winter, the heat will be drawn back up again. “This is what saving the planet looks like,” said the aptly named Ted Borer, head of energy plants at Princeton. “It’s hugely chaotic. It’s messy. It’s disruptive.” But, he added, “There’ll be kids playing Frisbee here a year from now.” Among the colleges where geoexchange or geothermal systems are being tested, installed or are in use are Smith, Oberlin, Dartmouth, Mount Holyoke, Carleton College, Ball State University, William &amp; Mary, Cornell University, Brown University and Columbia University. Many of the colleges are using their projects as a classroom, conducting educational seminars and tours. Lindsey Olsen, associate vice president and senior mechanical engineer at Salas O’Brien, a technical engineering firm, said five years ago, the company was working on two or three campus geothermal projects at one time. That figure has grown to between 20 and 30 projects, she said. Around the country, geoexchange systems are generating enthusiasm from students, faculty, staff and alumni. “I’m not always the person they’re applauding at a faculty meeting,” said David DeSwert, executive vice president for finance and administration at Smith College, where a geothermal system is expected to cut carbon emissions by 90 percent. “When we were presenting this, they were extremely, extremely happy.” — Cara Buckley Other climate news An atmospheric river wreaked havoc in San Diego, sparking flash floods and sweeping away cars.  Exxon Mobil is suing two activist investors to prevent a climate proposal from getting a shareholder vote. The U.S. global food security envoy is pushing to bring back traditional African crops that American policies helped to sideline. New York may soon join a growing number of states seeking to incorporate climate change into school lesson plans. Rising temperatures are threatening Swiss glaciers, which have long been considered Europe’s water tower. Reusing rare earth metalsfrom old tech gadgets could meet much of global demand.

2023-08-08,Curbing Contrails: A Climate Solution in the Skies,52,"The wispy condensation from jet airplanes can trap vast amounts of heat in the atmosphere. Slowing down climate change is going to require big fixes, and many small ones, too.  Case in point: contrails, those wispy white lines that trail some airplanes flying high in the sky. Contrails, short for condensation trails, are produced when exhaust from jets mixes with water vapor at extremely high altitudes, forming minuscule ice particles. Scientists have known for decades that in some cases, contrails spread out across huge areas, trapping heat in the atmosphere. That may sound insignificant given the vastness of the sky. Yet studies have estimated that contrails are responsible for as much as 35 percent of all of the planetary warming attributable to aviation. By some measures, contrails account for upward of 1 percent of human-caused global warming. “We now know enough about contrails and their impact to know we need to do something about it,” said Andrew Chen of RMI, a nonprofit that promotes sustainability. Here’s the new part: A team from Google, Breakthrough Energy and American Airlines says it has demonstrated a relatively cheap and easy way to significantly reduce contrails. Their research, which was shared exclusively with Climate Forward before being submitted to a scientific journal, found that adjusting a plane’s altitude by just a couple thousand feet reduced contrail formation by more than half. The results, they say, suggest it could be relatively easy, quick and cheap to start reducing contrails at scale. “The opportunity here is twofold,” said Chen, who was not involved in the project. “It’s near-term, and it’s cost-effective.” (And for the record: Contrails are not a bioweapon used to control the masses, as some conspiracy theorists would have you believe.) Changing altitudes The researchers used weather and satellite data, along with some machine learning, to develop a model that predicts where contrails are most likely to form.  Using the model created by Google and Breakthrough, American slightly altered the flight paths of 70 daytime flights. Pilots flew one leg of a round-trip journey at an altitude where contrails were expected to form. Going the other way, they flew at a slightly lower altitude, hoping to avoid contrail formation.  After the flights, the researchers looked at satellite imagery and determined that in total, the flights at the lower altitudes produced 54 percent fewer contrails. “It’s a really exciting study,” said Chen. “I’m very pleased with the design, and it will help us answer a bunch of very high-priority questions right now.” There was a cost: Flights avoiding contrails used 2 percent more fuel on average, because flying at lower altitudes expends more energy. That’s a big problem for an industry in which one of the biggest expenses is jet fuel — American spent nearly $14 billion on it last year.  “Burning more jet fuel is not inconsequential to American or to any other airline,” said Jill Blickstein, the airline’s vice president of sustainability. “We wouldn’t do this at any cost.” Moreover, it wouldn’t make much sense for the broader climate challenges to have airlines burn more jet fuel just to prevent contrails.  But the researchers say they expect that only a small fraction of flights will need to change altitude to avoid contrails, and that in total, the additional fuel burn should be only 0.3 percent higher, resulting in a relatively cost-effective way to reduce global warming, even as the larger fight to reduce fossil-fuel consumption continues. The challenges ahead Beyond the potential costs, there are questions and challenges that need to be addressed before contrail avoidance becomes a routine part of commercial aviation.  The contrails that produce the most warming are those that form at night. They block heat that is rising from the ground, without any offsetting reflection of incoming sunlight. But the tests conducted by American took place during the day. The researchers say they are confident their approach will be just as successful during night flights, but it will take more tests to prove them right. Then there’s the matter of making this technology widely accessible. The researchers say they’re talking with the Federal Aviation Administration about integrating forecasts for contrails into flight-management software, just like turbulence forecasts.  (A study published in Geophysical Research Letters in June found that climate change hadincreased the amount of turbulence on popular flight routes by more than 50 percent since the 1970s.) “The airline industry knows how to avoid turbulence,” said Juliet Rothenberg, the lead product manager for climate A.I. at Google. “It’s a very straightforward extension to avoid contrails.” Others are working on the problem, too, including Eurocontrol, a pan-Europe aviation organization; Delta, which is working with M.I.T.; and Satavia, a British start-up that is working with Etihad and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines. There are also other ways to reduce contrails. Using low-carbon aviation fuel, which is in limited use but growing fast, can also help because its exhaust contains less soot. Reducing contrails alone won’t solve aviation’s climate-change problem. Air travel is responsible for about 3.5 percent of human-caused warming, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The much bigger challenge will be finding ways to power jets without fuels that spew planet-warming emissions into the atmosphere — or to simply fly less. But the experiment by Google, Breakthrough and American is the most promising sign yet that contrail avoidance can work. It points to a relatively cheap, easy and quick way to reduce one source of global warming. “You can’t just do contrail avoidance,” Rothenberg said. “But this is really unique among climate solutions in that it can scale in years, not decades.” Forest countries unite for the Amazon The countries of the Amazon Basin are holding the highest profile meeting in half a century to find common cause in protecting the world’s biggest rainforest. Leaders from Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Peru, Suriname and Venezuela are attending the summit in Belém, Brazil this week, along with attendees from other tropical forest countries, including Indonesia and the Republic of Congo. Attendees criticized wealthy countries for not following through on a promise to deliver $100 billion in climate finance annually to poorer nations. The leaders of Norway, France and Germany were invited to attend the summit but are sending representatives instead. The United States was not invited. It won’t be easy to reach a consensus. Colombia has been pushing for a ban on new oil development in the Amazon, but Brazil is still considering a huge offshore oil drilling project at the mouth of the Amazon River. And an attempt by Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, the president of Brazil, to secure a pledge to end illegal deforestation by 2030 looks like a long shot. Observers don’t expect any bold commitments in Belém, which will host the United Nations COP30 climate meetings in 2025. But just the fact that it’s happening is a step forward, said Alicia Guzmán of the environmental nonprofit Stand.earth. “Whatever the result, it’s a historic summit,” she told me. “Now, governments won’t be able to go back to normal, without thinking of everything they are killing.”  — Manuela Andreoni Other climate news A conservative think tank’s plan for the next Republican president would dismantle efforts to slow global warming. The European Union’s climate observatory confirmed that July was the hottest month ever recorded. Residential microgrids, powered by solar panels and batteries, are on the rise in the U.S. Big oil companies are struggling to attract engineers and other highly skilled young workers who are concerned about climate change, The Wall Street Journal reports. Tensions are escalating between Iran and Afghanistan over a water dispute exacerbated by climate change, with the Taliban deploying troops and suicide bombers to the border, Bloomberg reports.

2023-07-01,Brazil Bars Bolsonaro From Office for Fraud Claims,53,"Brazil's electoral court banned former President Jair Bolsonaro from seeking office until 2030 for spreading false claims about the nation's voting system. Brazilian election officials on Friday blocked former President Jair Bolsonaro from seeking public office until 2030, removing a top contender from the next presidential contest and dealing a significant blow to the country's far-right movement.   Brazil's electoral court ruled that Mr. Bolsonaro had violated Brazil's election laws when, less than three months ahead of last year's vote, he called diplomats to the presidential palace and made baseless claims that the nation's voting systems were likely to be rigged against him.  Five of the court's seven judges voted that Mr. Bolsonaro had abused his power as president when he convened the meeting with diplomats and broadcast it on state television.  ''This response will confirm our faith in the democracy,'' said Alexandre de Moraes, a Supreme Court justice who leads the electoral court, as he cast his vote against Mr. Bolsonaro.  The decision is a sharp and swift rebuke of Mr. Bolsonaro and his effort to undermine Brazil's elections. Just six months ago, Mr. Bolsonaro was president of one of the world's largest democracies. Now his career as a politician is in jeopardy.  Under the ruling, Mr. Bolsonaro, 68, will next be able to run for president in 2030, when he is 75. The next presidential election is scheduled for 2026.  Mr. Bolsonaro said Friday that he was not surprised by the 5-to-2 decision because the court had always been against him. ''Come on. We know that since I took office they said I was going to carry out a coup,'' he told reporters (though he, too, had hinted at that possibility). ''This is not democracy.''  His lawyers had argued that his speech to diplomats was an ''act of government'' aimed at raising legitimate concerns about election security.  Mr. Bolsonaro appeared to accept his fate, saying Friday that he would focus on campaigning for other right-wing candidates.  Yet he is still expected to appeal the ruling to Brazil's Supreme Court, though that body acted aggressively to rein in his power during his presidency. He has harshly attacked the high court for years, calling some justices ''terrorists'' and accusing them of trying to sway the vote against him.  Even if an appeal is successful, Mr. Bolsonaro would face another 15 cases in the electoral court, including accusations that he improperly used public funds to influence the vote and that his campaign ran a coordinated misinformation campaign. Any of those cases could also block him from seeking the presidency.  He is also linked to several criminal investigations, involving whether he provoked his supporters to storm Brazil's halls of power on Jan. 8 and whether he was involved in a scheme to falsify his vaccine records. (Mr. Bolsonaro has declined the Covid-19 vaccine.) A conviction in any criminal case would also render him ineligible for office, in addition to carrying possible prison time.  Mr. Bolsonaro was a shock to Brazil's politics when he was elected president in 2018. A former Army captain and fringe far-right congressman, he rode a populist wave to the presidency on an anti-corruption campaign.  His lone term was marked by controversy from the start, including a sharp rise in deforestation in the Amazon rainforest, a hands-off approach to the pandemic that left nearly 700,000 dead in Brazil and harsh attacks against the press, the judiciary and the left.  But it was his repeated broadsides against Brazil's voting systems that alarmed many Brazilians, as well as the international community, stoking worries that he might try to hold on to power if he lost last October's election.  Mr. Bolsonaro did lose by a slim margin and at first refused to concede. Under pressure from allies and rivals, he eventually agreed to a transition to President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.  Yet, after listening to Mr. Bolsonaro's false claims for years, many Bolsonaro supporters remained convinced that Mr. Lula, a leftist, had stolen the election. On Jan. 8, a week after Mr. Lula took office, thousands of people stormed Brazil's Congress, Supreme Court and presidential offices, hoping to induce the military to take over the government and restore Mr. Bolsonaro as president.  Mr. Bolsonaro said on Friday that the riot was not an attempted coup, but instead ''little old women and little old men, with Brazilian flags on their back and Bibles under their arms.''  Since then, more evidence has emerged that at least some members of Mr. Bolsonaro's inner circle were entertaining ideas of a coup. Brazil's federal police found separate drafts of plans for Mr. Bolsonaro to hold on to power at the home of Mr. Bolsonaro's justice minister and on the phone of his former assistant.  Mr. Bolsonaro's attacks on the voting system and the Jan. 8 riot in Brazil bore a striking resemblance to former president Donald J. Trump's denials that he lost the 2020 election and the Jan. 6, 2021, storming of the U.S. Capitol.  Yet the result for the two former presidents has so far been different. While Mr. Bolsonaro has already been excluded from the next presidential race, Mr. Trump remains the leading contender for the Republican presidential nomination. Mr. Trump could also still run for president even if he is convicted of any of the various criminal charges he faces.  The ruling against Mr. Bolsonaro upends politics in Latin America's largest nation. For years, he has pulled Brazil's conservative movement further to the right with harsh rhetoric against rivals, skepticism of science, a love of guns and an embrace of the culture wars.  He received 49.1 percent of the vote in the 2022 election, just 2.1 million votes behind Mr. Lula, in the nation's closest presidential contest since it returned to democracy in 1985, following a military dictatorship.  Yet conservative leaders in Brazil, with an eye toward Mr. Bolsonaro's legal challenges, have started to move on, touting Tarcísio Gomes de Freitas, the right-wing governor of Brazil's largest state, São Paulo, as the new standard-bearer of the right and a 2026 challenger to Mr. Lula.  ''He is a much more palatable candidate because he doesn't have Bolsonaro's liabilities and because he is making a move to the center,'' said Marta Arretche, a political science professor at the University of São Paulo.  The Brazilian press and pollsters have speculated that Mr. Bolsonaro's wife, Michelle, or two of his sons would run for president. Mr. Bolsonaro said recently that he told Ms. Bolsonaro she doesn't have the necessary experience, ''but she is an excellent campaigner.''  Friday's decision is also further proof that Mr. Moraes, the head of the electoral court, has become one of Brazil's most powerful men.  During Mr. Bolsonaro's administration, Mr. Moraes acted as the most effective check on the president's power, leading investigations into Mr. Bolsonaro and his allies, jailing some of his supporters for what he viewed as threats against Brazil's institutions and ordering tech companies to remove the accounts of many other right-wing voices.  Those tactics raised concerns that he was abusing his power, and Mr. Bolsonaro and his supporters have called Mr. Moraes an authoritarian. On the left, he has been praised as the savior of Brazil's democracy.  Mr. Bolsonaro's case before the electoral court stemmed from a 47-minute meeting on July 18 in which he called dozens of foreign diplomats to the presidential residence to present what he promised was evidence of fraud in past Brazilian elections.  He made unfounded claims that Brazil's voting machines changed ballots for him to other candidates in a previous election and that a 2018 hack of the electoral court's computer network showed the vote could be rigged. But security experts have said the hackers could never gain access to the voting machines or change votes.  The speech was broadcast on the Brazilian government's television network and its social media channels. Some tech companies later took the video down because it spread election misinformation.  As for Mr. Bolsonaro's future plans? He told the Brazilian newspaper Folha de São Paulo that during the three months he spent in Florida this year after his election loss, he was offered a job as a ''poster boy'' for American businesses wanting to reach Brazilians.  ''I went to a hamburger joint and it filled with people,'' he said. ''But I don't want to abandon my country.''

Mr. Bolsonaro’s case before the electoral court stemmed from a 47-minute meeting on July 18 in which he called dozens of foreign diplomats to the presidential residence to present what he promised was evidence of fraud in past Brazilian elections. He made unfounded claims that Brazil’s voting machines changed ballots for him to other candidates in a previous election and that a 2018 hack of the electoral court’s computer network showed the vote could be rigged. But security experts have said the hackers could never gain access to the voting machines or change votes. The speech was broadcast on the Brazilian government’s television network and its social media channels. Some tech companies later took the video down because it spread election misinformation. As for Mr. Bolsonaro’s future plans? He told the Brazilian newspaper Folha de São Paulo that during the three months he spent in Florida this year after his election loss, he was offered a job as a “poster boy” for American businesses wanting to reach Brazilians. “I went to a hamburger joint and it filled with people,” he said. “But I don’t want to abandon my country.” Ana Ionova, Letícia Casado and Lis Moriconi contributed reporting.

2023-01-19,"Marina Silva says Brazil will lead the defense of the Amazon after the ""blackout"".",57,"Davos (Switzerland), Jan. 19. The Brazilian Minister of Environment, Marina Silva, said Thursday that the government of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva intends to lead the protection of the Amazon and be a world example despite the difficulties to reduce deforestation after the ""blackout"" left by Jair Bolsonaro. Silva, a recognized environmental leader and who resumed the ministry she exercised during Lula's first government (2003-2006), assured the attendees at the World Economic Forum in Davos (Switzerland) that Brazil already has the experience and scientific knowledge necessary to reduce deforestation in the Amazon to zero by 2030. ""We have a successful experience to reduce deforestation. In Lula's first governments we managed to reduce the rates of destruction of the Amazon by 83%,"" he said. He added that, despite the fact that at that time the government had to start from scratch because there was neither experience nor knowledge to combat deforestation, now we have to start from scratch again after the desolate scenario left by Bolsonaro (2019-2022). ""Now it is more difficult because Bolsonaro caused a blackout in environmental policies; he dismantled the control and oversight bodies; he reduced the budgets for combating deforestation and empowered segments opposed to the protection of forests and indigenous peoples,"" he said. Silva recalled that during Bolsonaro's four years in office, devastation in the world's largest rainforest reached record levels. LULA ACTS QUICKLY And he added that in the first days of Lula's government, who took office for his third term on January 1, the deforestation control plan was already reestablished; the Amazon Fund was reactivated, Bolsonaro's controversial measures such as the one that allowed mining in the Amazon were revoked, and a group with 17 ministries was set up to define preservation policies. ""We are here (in Davos) to say that Brazil returned to the world stage determined to regain its prominence as a driver of initiatives to combat climate change and preserve biodiversity and to join efforts in defining a new, more sustainable development model,"" he said. ""We consider that as the country with the largest extension in the Amazon it is our duty to protect it and we want to lead by example before the world,"" he added. But he clarified that to ensure the success of these efforts it is necessary to have the backing of the countries with which Brazil shares it, as well as the financial and technological support of rich countries and companies. ""Lula is going to travel shortly to participate in a meeting of Amazon countries to think about a common strategy,"" he said in reference to the Amazon summit scheduled for next May. Silva explained that the Brazilian strategy for the preservation of the Amazon has two aspects, one aimed at protecting 57 million hectares still protected, and the other to promote sustainable development to guarantee the livelihood of the 30 million Brazilians living in the region. In the same debate in Davos, entitled ""The Amazon at a crossroads"", the governor of the state of Pará, Helder Barbalho, presented the Bioeconomy Plan created by his administration to guarantee preservation in the second largest Amazonian state in Brazil and which made it possible to reduce deforestation by 21% between 2021 and 2022 and to promote a sustainable economic model.

2023-01-02,"Marina Silva, defender of the Brazilian Amazon to repeat as Minister of Environment",58," In 1994, at the age of 35, she was elected Senator of the Republic, being the youngest person in the history of the country to hold this elected position. Photo: EFE - Andre BorgesAt the end of last week, the recently inaugurated president of Brazil, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, presented the people who will be in charge of the 37 ministries of  the country. The name of Maria Osmarina da Silva Vaz de Lima, better known as Marina Silva, stood out above other appointments, because besides being an old acquaintance of the Brazilian president, she repeats at the head of the Ministry of Environment, a portfolio in which she stood out for her results during her first term. (You can read: A solution to the garbage problem in Leticia) Silva was born 63 years ago in the small community of Breu Velho, which is part of Rio Branco, the capital of the department of Acre, in northern Brazil. He was born into a large family, with ten siblings, but very poor, which is why, from a very young age, he had to dedicate himself to the rubber business, the most predominant in the region and to which his father was dedicated. In her adolescence, hepatitis led her to seek help in Rio Branco, where she was cared for by the Sisters Servants of Mary Reparatrix. During her stay, she thought of becoming a nun and there she found the motivation to learn to read and write. However, her vocation began to change when, entering a church, she came across a notice of a rural union leadership course to be taught by theologian Clodovis Boff and union leader Chico Mendes. (May be of interest to you: A draft law in Peru threatens indigenous peoples in isolation) Since then, her path has been focused on the union, environmental and political struggle. Along with her training as a historian, she was one of the founding members of the Central Única de Trabajadores (CUT) of Acre, together with Mendes, and ran for her first elected positions in her region, although without success. At the age of 32 she was elected as a state deputy and four years later she became a senator in Brasília, the youngest person to reach that position in the history of the country. At that time, she was awarded the Goldman Prize, considered the Nobel Prize for the Environment. In 2002 she was re-elected and a year later, Lula, who was beginning his first term as president, appointed her as Minister of the Environment. (When Silva arrived at that post, deforestation in the Amazon rainforest was at an all-time high, with more than 27,000 square kilometers of forest cleared. For this reason, one of her first actions was the creation of the Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Deforestation in the Legal Amazon (PPCDAm). Three years later, deforestation had been reduced by more than half. For these achievements, and others, the British newspaper The Guardian considered her one of the 50 people who could help save the planet in 2007 and the United Nations (UN) awarded her the 'Champions of the Earth' prize, the organization's main environmental award. However, a year later, her relationship with Lula fractured and Silva resigned from the ministry. The then minister considered that a series of constructions promoted by the government would be harmful to the Amazon, which is why she decided to leave her post and return to the Senate. Two years later, she ran for president, coming in third place, the same position she occupied in 2014, when she repeated her candidacy. She wanted to be president again in 2018. (You may be interested in: A tributary of the Amazon River in Brazil seriously affected by a hydroelectric dam) A week and a half before the first presidential round in Brazil took place, Marina Silva announced her support for Lula. ""Our political reunion is taking place in the face of a serious political situation. We have the threat of threats, a threat to our democracy"", said the now Minister of the Environment at the time. Undoubtedly, Silva's main challenge at the head of the environmental portfolio will be to stop deforestation in the Amazon rainforest, which, according to the Brazilian Institute for Spatial Research (INPE), has increased since Jair Bolsonaro became president in 2009. Susana Muhamad, Colombia's Minister of Environment, celebrated Silva's appointment: ""Congratulations Marina Silva, Colombia and Brazil united to Save the Amazon and the socio-ecological transition. We environmentalists in South America celebrate!"", she said on her Twitter account. (You can read: The evidence of the Prosecutor's Office against three mayors for crossing an illegal road in the Amazon) To face the main challenge of her portfolio, Silva has already announced that ""we will strengthen oversight, we will recompose the public policy, which is the PPCDAm and will be resumed immediately, we will resume the Amazon Fund to provide resources, in addition to strengthening management bodies, such as ICMBio, and oversight bodies, such as Ibama"" . One of the immediate effects of Silva's arrival in office was the change in the name of the ministry, which is now called the Ministry of Environment and Climate Change, as well as the creation of a couple of secretariats: the Extraordinary Secretariat for Combating Deforestation and the Secretariat for Bioeconomy and Genetic Resources. The new Minister of Environment announced that she is already working with her counterpart of Justice to address another of the serious problems that the country is experiencing: environmental crimes.

Cappelli informed that the program will include the installation of new land and river bases in the region, the expansion and training of personnel and investments in technological solutions that will help the Brazilian state to regain effective control of the region. ""Illegal activities that have proliferated in the region in recent years will be combated, ranging from illegal mining and deforestation to the presence of criminal organizations, which used to be a reality only in major centers, but are now established and growing in a very dangerous way throughout the Amazon region. The executive secretary stressed that ""this is our commitment to present in the coming days the Amas program, detailing the entire justice and public security operation, led by Minister Flávio Dino, for the entire region, in line with the guidelines set by the Guidance Committee of the Amazon Fund and also by the Plan for Prevention and Control of Deforestation in the Legal Amazon (PPCDAm).

2023-03-22,Norwegian Minister says Brazil has returned to environmental leadership,60,"Norway's Minister of Climate and Environment, Espen Barth Eide, said on Wednesday (22) that Brazil is resuming the global leadership it once had, when it comes to environmental issues. Thestatement was made during his meeting with the Minister of Environment and Climate Change, Marina Silva. The two ministers released a joint statement in which they reaffirmed the bilateral partnership on climate and forests, which began in 2008, with the launch of the Amazon Fund, by Brazil; and the International Climate and Forests Initiative (NICFI), by Norway. ""Through the 2008 bilateral Memorandum of Understanding, Norway supported the Amazon Fund, which became a model for several other bilateral partnerships. In the following years, Brazil continued to achieve a remarkable reduction in deforestation in the Amazon and delivered one of the most important climate mitigation results in the world,"" the MMA said in a statement. Global leadership Barth Eide told the Brazilian Minister that ""Brazil has shown global leadership in the past and is doing it again now. Still according to the Norwegian, the international community must spare no efforts to mobilize all available tools and resources to partner with the Brazilian government. He reinforced that Norway is ""deeply committed to remaining a close and long-term partner of Brazil. Both Barth Eide and Marina Silva advocated for a ""rapid operationalization of the resources available in the Amazon Fund to support the critical needs identified by Brazil to reduce deforestation and promote sustainable and inclusive development in the Amazon Region."" The Norwegian minister said that his country will support Brazil in mobilizing additional resources for the Amazon Fund, as well as to increase cooperation, investments and public and private financing. ""In this context, both authorities committed to exchange views on how best to take advantage of opportunities emerging from different approaches, including results-based payments and jurisdictional carbon markets,"" the MMA said.

2023-01-27,"One third of Amazon 'degraded' by human activity, drought: study",61,"Manila, Jan. 27 -- WASHINGTON, United States - More than one third of the Amazon rainforest may have been degraded by human activity and drought, researchers said Thursday, and action is needed to protect the critically important ecosystem. In a study published in the journal Science, the researchers said the damage done to the forest which spans nine countries is significantly greater than previously known. For the study, they examined the impact of fire, logging, drought and changes to habitat along the forest borders - what they called edge effects. Most previous research into the Amazon ecosystem has focused on the consequences of deforestation. The study found that fire, timber extraction and edge effects have degraded at least 5.5 percent of all remaining Amazonian forests, or 364,748 square kilometers, between 2001 and 2018. But when the effects of drought are factored in, the degraded area increases to 2.5 million square kms, or 38 percent of the remaining Amazonian forests. ""Extreme droughts have become increasingly frequent in the Amazon as land-use change and human-induced climate change progress, affecting tree mortality, fire incidence, and carbon emissions to the atmosphere,"" the researchers said. ""Forest fires intensify during drought years,"" they said, warning of the dangers of ""much larger megafires"" in the future. The researchers from Brazil's Universidade Estadual de Campinas and other institutions used satellite images and other data from 2001 to 2018 to reach their conclusions. In a separate study published in Science of the human impacts on the Amazon, researchers from the University of Louisiana Lafayette and elsewhere called for action. ""The Amazon is perched to transition rapidly from a largely natural to degraded and transformed landscape, under the combined pressures of regional deforestation and global climate change,"" they said. ""The changes are happening much too rapidly for Amazonian species, peoples, and ecosystems to respond adaptively,"" they said. ""Policies to prevent the worst outcomes are known and must be enacted immediately. ""To fail the Amazon is to fail the biosphere, and we fail to act at our peril,"" they said.

2023-01-13,"Ricardo Galvão, former director of Inpe, to take on presidency of CNPq",63,"The physicist Ricardo Galvão, former director of Inpe (National Institute for Space Research), should be announced as the new president of CNPq (National Council for Scientific and Technological Development) next week. The decision, as reported by Folha, has not yet been officially confirmed, but has already been taken by the Minister of Science, Technology and Innovation, Luciana Santos. Galvão is 75 years old, a professor at the Physics Institute at USP (University of São Paulo), and was a candidate for federal deputy in São Paulo for the Network, but was not elected. In recent months, he participated in the Lula government's transition team. The researcher became known in 2019 for producing in the country. In July of that year, when charged by the foreign press about the high levels of deforestation alerts that had been being registered by Inpe's Deter system, Bolsonaro said he had ""conviction"" that the data were ""liars"" and accused Galvão of being ""at the service of some NGO."" ""I've even asked the guy who is in charge of Inpe to explain himself here in Brasilia, to explain this data that was leaked to the press,"" said the then president. ""Our feeling is that this is not consistent with reality. It even seems that he is at the service of some NGO, which is very common."" It was Bolsonaro's first attack of denialism not only to what was happening in the Amazon, which was suffering from a rapid advance of deforestation, but to data scientifically produced by government agencies themselves. Inpe is linked to the Ministry of Science. Galvão reacted immediately. In an interview to Estadão, he said that Bolsonaro manifested himself ""as if he were in a bar conversation"", with ""improper comments and without any basis"". The researcher, who had started his career at Inpe in 1970 and was at the head of the organ's presidency since 2016 stated, in the same interview, that Bolsonaro ""took a pusillanimous, cowardly attitude"" and said he expected to be called to Brasília to explain the data. ""And that he has the courage to repeat it, looking face to face, in my eyes."" Bolsonaro never spoke to Galvão, continued to deny the data, and exonerated him two weeks later. Inpe's monitoring, however, continued to show, month after month, that deforestation in the Amazon continued unabated. In the four years he has been in office, the Legal Amazon, the area that encompasses the largest tropical forest in the world, has lost 45,586 km2 - an unprecedented 59% increase in relation to the previous four years. In 2022, for the fourth consecutive year, the annual deforestation rate in the Amazon was above 10,000 km2. Galvão's confrontation with Bolsonaro has borne fruit. At the end of 2019 he was chosen by the British science magazine Nature as one of the ten people who were most important to science that year, precisely for having defended scientific knowledge in the face of Bolsonaro. The magazine said Galvão captured global attention when he challenged Bolsonaro for undermining data showing the sharp increase in deforestation rates in the Amazon. ""(They were) acts that he knew would lead to him losing his job. What he didn't know was that he would become a hero of sorts, acclaimed by his fellow scientists as well as by strangers on the street. One woman even stopped him in the subway in São Paulo to thank him for standing up to Bolsonaro and helping her understand why preserving the Amazon is important,"" the scientific journal pointed out at the time. In early 2021, he was also awarded the international award for Scientific Freedom and Responsibility given by the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS). ""Professor Galvão defended sound science in the face of hostility. He acted to protect the welfare of the Brazilian people and the immense natural wonder that is the Amazon rainforest, a world heritage site,"" Jessica Wyndham, director of the AAAS Program on Scientific Responsibility, Human Rights and Law, said in a statement. At the head of CNPq Galvão will have the challenge of helping to rebuild the impaired investment in research. The agency is the federal government's main agency for promoting science and has suffered successive budget cuts and blockages in recent years. The ABC (Brazilian Academy of Sciences) recently highlighted that students in exclusive dedication regime for master's and doctoral degrees receive by CNPq, respectively, R$ 1,500 and R$ 2,200, values that have not been adjusted since 2013. Upon taking office on January 2, Minister Luciana Santos promised to work to readjust the scholarships. According to ABC's calculation, if corrected only by the accumulated inflation over the period, the scholarships should rise to R$2,700 for master's students and R$4,000 for doctoral students.

2023-03-07,Satellite data confirms that the Amazon is losing its forests,64,"The project is called Sentinel-1 for Science: Amazon and, ESA warns, forest ecosystems are rapidly experiencing the effects of climate change, making timely forest monitoring increasingly urgent. Forests play an important role in offsetting anthropogenic fossil fuel emissions. Since 2015, the world's tropical forests can be regularly observed at an unprecedented interval of 6 to 12 days thanks to the Copernicus Sentinel-1 mission, ESA says in a statement. Millions of gigabytes of radar data are acquired both day and night, regardless of cloud cover, haze, smoke or aerosols, making it possible to monitor deforestation and forest degradation at least every two weeks. However, the challenge is to find suitable methods to extract meaningful indicators of forest loss from the huge amounts of incoming radar data so that anomalies in the time series can be detected regularly and consistently across tropical forests. The Sentinel-1 for Science: Amazon project presents a simple and transparent method of using Sentinel-1 satellite radar imagery to estimate forest loss. The project uses a spatio-temporal data cube design, also known as StatCubes - a method for multidimensional and temporal analysis of large amounts of data. With this approach, a dynamic analysis of deforestation in the Amazon basin is created. The team was able to detect a forest loss of more than 5.2 million hectares between 2017 and 2021, which is roughly equivalent to the size of Costa Rica. Neha Hunka, remote sensing expert at Gisat, commented, ""What we are seeing from space is that more than one million hectares of tropical rainforests disappear every year in the Amazon basin, with the worst year being 2021 in Brazil."" ""We can track these losses and report on them transparently and consistently every 12 days from now on.""

2023-01-03,United Kingdom could join Amazon Fund to help Brazil control deforestation: minister,65,"BRASILIA, Jan 3 (Reuters) - The United Kingdom is considering joining the $1 billion Amazon Fund reopened by President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva to finance sustainability in the rainforest, British Environment Minister Therese Coffey said. ""It is something we are seriously considering,"" Coffey told Reuters on Monday in Brasilia, where she attended Lula's inauguration earlier in the day. The minister said the British government was already in talks with the fund's current partners, Norway and Germany, which donated $1.2 billion to set up the initiative. The fund was frozen by the ultra-right government of Jair Bolsonaro, alleging irregularities among the projects managed by NGOs without offering any proof. One of Lula's first decisions upon taking office was to reverse Bolsonaro's policies that weakened environmental protection and helped contribute to deforestation, which reached its highest level in 15 years, including a measure encouraging mining on protected indigenous lands. Lula also reopened the Amazon Fund. The UK is already Brazil's third largest environmental partner, having committed more than 250 million pounds from its international pilot fund, said the official, who met with Environment Minister Marina Silva, Agriculture Minister Carlos Favaro and Indigenous Peoples Minister Sonia Guajajara. Indigenous communities were especially hit by illegal mining that advanced along with deforestation in the Amazon under Bolsonaro's government. ""I see the desire and intention to reverse that,"" she said. Coffey added that Pará governor Helder Barbalho had invited her to visit his vast Amazon state to see projects in the rainforest, which she had never experienced before.

2023-01-04,United Kingdom to fund Amazon Fund to boost sustainability in the rainforest,66,"TheUnited Kingdom is considering joining the Amazon Fund, formed by Norway and Germany, to finance sustainability in the Amazon rainforest. This was explained this Wednesday, January 4, 2023, by the British Minister for the Environment, Agriculture and Rural Affairs, Thérèse Coffey. ""It is something we are seriously analyzing,"" Coffey told the press during her visit to Brazil, where she attended the inauguration of the new president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. As founders of the Amazon Fund, Norway and Germany initially contributed USD 1.2 billion. The fund currently has some US$ 600 million available for environmental protection projects. According to the British minister, her country has much to offer Brazil, including rural sustainability programs and low-carbon architecture to help in mobilizing funds with its strength as a global hub for green finance. Bolsonaro's policies encouraged deforestation in the rainforest The Amazon Fund was frozen by the government of Jair Bolsonaro, who alleged irregularities in the projects managed by NGOs, although without presenting any evidence. One of Lula's first measures after his return to the Presidency was to revoke Bolsonaro's policies that weakened environmental protectionand helped foster deforestation in the Amazon, which reached its highest level in 15 years last year.

2023-02-10,"With Biden, Lula speaks against inequality and asks for partnership for the environment",67," In a speech next to the American leader, Joe Biden, president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (PT) cited common challenges with the United States and defended democracy, the fight against inequality and preached 'care for the Amazon' and partnership for climate change. ""We now have some problems to work together. First, never again allow there to be a new chapter on Capitol Hill and never again allow what happened in Brazil with the invasion of Congress, the Planalto, and the STF. The second thing that we have to work together is the fight against inequality. The racial issue that, from time to time, I see being practiced in every country, in the USA, in Brazil. Especially young blacks from the periphery are often victims of the incapacity of the state because the violence that exists in the periphery is the absence of the state with public policies to guarantee dreams for youth. ""The third thing is the climate issue. We have had a commitment since 2009 in Copenhagen, when I participated in COP 15 where we made a commitment to reduce deforestation by 80% and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 39% and we have fulfilled it,"" he added. In a poke at former president Jair Bolsonaro (PL), Lula said that ""in recent years, the Amazon has been invaded by political and human irrationality. ""We had a president who ordered deforestation, who ordered mining in indigenous areas, who ordered mining in the forests that we demarcated as a reserve in the Amazon,"" he said. Lula also stressed the goal of zero deforestation in the Amazon by 2030 and that he intends to transform it into ""a research center shared with the whole world."" ""I made a commitment that by 2030 we will reach zero deforestation in the Amazon. We are going to make a great effort to transform the Amazon, not into a sanctuary for humanity, but into a research center shared with the entire world so that we can take advantage of the wealth of biodiversity in the Amazon, to see if we can transform this wealth into an improvement in the quality of life of the people who live in the Amazon,"" he pointed out. ""Caring for the Amazon today is caring for planet earth. Taking care of planet earth is taking care of our survival. And, for this reason, we all have the obligation to leave our children and grandchildren a better world than the one we received from our parents"", he pointed out. ""A 300-year-old tree has no owner. Nobody can cut it down. It is a patrimony of humanity. It is there to guarantee the subsistence of the planet and that is why we are going to take the climate issue very seriously"", he added. The Brazilian President also defended the union between Brazil and the USA for a ""global governance"" for measures in favor of the environment. ""We need to establish a new conversation to build a stronger global governance. Because on the climate issue, if we don't have global governance that takes decisions, that all countries are obliged to comply with, if we don't have it, it won't work"". ""I don't know which forum, I don't know if in the UN, in the G20, in the G8, but something has to be done to oblige the countries, our Congress, businessmen to comply with the decisions that we take at a global level. If this doesn't happen, our discussion about the climate issue will be greatly impaired. I don't think we have much time. We urgently need to take action. In Brazil, we will do what is possible to do"". Finally, he added that ""both the USA and the rest of the world can count on Brazil in the fight for democracy and in the fight for environmental preservation"". ""This is not a government program. It is a commitment of faith from someone who believes in humanism, in fraternity, in solidarity. I don't want to live in a world where humans will turn into algorithms. I want to live in a world where humans are human. And, for this, we need to take great care of what God has given us, which is planet earth,"" he concluded.

2023-03-22,"""Water loss is a wake-up call for climate change""",68,"Brazil concentrates the largest volume of fresh water in the world, but it has been drying up in recent decades. For a specialist, the reduction indicates ongoing global warming.Brazil concentrates the largest volume of fresh water in the world: 12% of the planet's hydric reserves and 53% of the hydric resources of South America are in national territory. Despite this abundance, the country has experienced three major droughts in the last 20 years. The most recent one, which occurred in 2021, was the most severe recorded in 90 years. A survey by the network of scientists MapBiomas also showed that Brazil is drying up: while in 1991 the country was covered by 19.7 million hectares of water, in 2022 this area will fall to 18.2 million hectares, a decrease of almost 8% of the water surface. This loss, according to the coordinator of the MapBiomas Água platform, Carlos Souza Junior, may be related to the decrease in underground water, the aquifers, which supply rivers and other water bodies. The specialist also points to climate change and deforestation as factors that explain this worrying scenario. ""A deforested land, that is, without vegetation, does not have time to absorb the water, because the runoff on its surface is very fast. Without absorption, the soil and subsoil can't be replenished,"" Souza said. In an interview with DW, Souza points out the importance of the Amazon forest in regulating rainfall in Brazil and the entire American continent, and suggests ways to try to halt the ongoing drought in the country. DW: The area covered by freshwater in Brazil has decreased by about 8% in the last three decades. What does it mean to say that the country has lost water surface area? Carlos Souza Junior: We don't have a definite diagnosis yet, but we have a study in the São Francisco River basin that shows that the reduction of water surface had a high correlation with the reduction of water in aquifers. That is, if the amount of water on the surface is being reduced, possibly the aquifers are already compromised. The Amazon and the Atlantic Forest have the largest freshwater reserves in Brazil, concentrating 60% and 12% of all water resources in the territory, but the Cerrado is the biome considered the country's water body. Why? The Cerrado is home to many river springs. For this reason, it plays an important role in providing water for various basins both inside and outside the biome. Despite this water importance, the Cerrado suffers very strong pressure from agribusiness, an activity that is a great consumer of water and is linked to deforestation. Speaking of deforestation, how does it interfere with the amount of freshwater available in the country? The natural vegetation is important to balance the humidity and local temperature, since it can retain the water on the land and, therefore, reduce the return of solar radiation to the atmosphere. However, a deforested terrain, that is, without vegetation, does not have time to absorb the water, because the runoff on its surface is very fast. Without the absorption, there is no supply of soil and subsoil. When we think only of the Amazon, a region rich in rivers, is the impact of deforestation on the hydrological cycle greater? Deforestation in the Amazon is a local problem, because it affects the hydrographic basins of the deforested region, but also global, since the forest works as a powerful hydraulic pump capable of regulating the hydrologic cycle of the entire American continent. When it rains, the roots of the vegetation absorb the water and retain it in the soil. This water absorbed by the forest will return to the atmosphere through the transpiration of the plants and will supply the clouds, which will be carried to other regions by means of the winds. This is the process called flying rivers. However, as we remove the forest, the Amazon ecosystem loses its ability to return moisture to the atmosphere, lacking the water to supply the clouds. So by interfering with the flying rivers, deforestation in the Amazon could affect rainfall on the continent. Is it possible to tell if climate change is already affecting the amount of freshwater in Brazil? Aquatic systems are the most vulnerable to climate effects. One example is the várzea areas in the Amazon, a type of vegetation that is temporarily or permanently flooded. Even away from the deforestation areas, we have observed that the várzeas are losing water. If it is not deforestation of the forest, the cause of the várzeas drying up is evaporation caused by local warming, since summers in the Amazon are increasingly dry, long, and hot. In other words, the loss of water in the várzeas is a warning that climate change is already causing changes in our aquatic systems, as is the reduction of water in the Pantanal. [Between 1985 and 2022, the water surface in the Pantanal has decreased by 81.7%, according to data from MapBiomas Água]. Although Brazil recovered 1.7 million hectares of water last year compared to 2021, a year in which the country recorded the lowest amount of freshwater in the last 30 years, the decrease in water surface in Mato Grosso (-48%) and Mato Grosso do Sul (-23%) draw attention. What explains these losses in both states? The water loss in these states is a result of the removal of natural vegetation over time, coupled with climate change, which is amplified in these locations by deforestation. Without natural vegetation, these states have difficulty absorbing and retaining water in the soil. There is also the presence of infrastructure that affects the quantity of water, such as small, medium, and large-scale dams, which reduce the flow of rivers. How to ensure that fresh drinking water will not be lacking in the future? With a set of measures that involve everything from public policies to mass awareness campaigns about the rational use of water and conservation. Each one has to do his or her part. It will also be necessary to stop deforestation in all biomes, besides avoiding the construction of dams and reservoirs, changing the production logic of agribusiness and investing in landscape planning to avoid very extensive agricultural production fields without vegetation. There is also the issue of chemical inputs in the field, such as fertilizers and pesticides used in large-scale agriculture. With the rains, these inputs flow into the aquatic ecosystems, causing a serious problem of contamination of the biodiversity in rivers and lakes and of the groundwater. If we reach a critical point of fresh water availability, is desalination of seawater an option? This is something very expensive. If we get to the level of having to resort to desalination of water, we have already lost the fight against climate change.

2023-01-27,38% of the Amazon would have been degraded,69,"Washington, United States AFP In a study published in the journal Science, researchers say the damage done to that forest that spans nine countries is significantly greater than previously known. For the study, the authors examined the impact of fires, logging, droughts and habitat changes along forest boundaries, known in ecology as edge effects. Most previous studies of the Amazon ecosystem have focused on the consequences of deforestation. Impact This study found that fires, timber extraction, and edge effects have degraded at least 5.5% of the remaining Amazon forest, or about 364,748 square kilometers, between 2001 and 2018. However, when drought effects appear, the degraded area increases to 2.5 million square kilometers, 38% of the Amazon forest. ""Extreme droughts have become increasingly frequent in the Amazon as land use change and human-induced climate change progress, affecting tree mortality, fire incidence and carbon emissions to the atmosphere,"" the study states. ""Wildfires intensify during drought years,"" they say, and warn of the dangers of ""much larger megafires"" in the future. Researchers from the State University of Campinas in Brazil and other institutions used satellite imagery and other data from 2001 to 2018 to reach their conclusions. President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has ratified his commitment to end deforestation in the Amazon by 2030. After his inauguration, the president signed a series of decrees to strengthen the protection of the Amazon. In one of the first measures, Lula revoked a decree authorizing mining on indigenous lands. Impact on species ""The Amazon is headed for a rapid transition from being a huge natural landscape to one degraded and transformed by the combined pressures of local deforestation and global climate change,"" they anticipated. ""Changes are happening much faster for Amazonian species, people and ecosystems,"" they warned. ""Policies to prevent the worst consequences are well known and must be put in place immediately."" Environment President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva spoke with his French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron, about ""challenges"" with the environment and the ""risks"" of the extreme right for democracy. Both agreed on the risks to democracy posed by the violent actions of the extreme right.

2023-02-03,Amazon: deforestation alerts show a drop in January,70," Four days before the closing of January 2023 data, the deforestation alert in the Amazon made by the Deter system indicates a drop in the historical series. The accumulated number of alerts in the Legal Amazon is 121 km2, the third lowest mark for the month so far in the historical series, which began in 2015. The figures are from the Institute for Space Research (Inpe). The Legal Amazon corresponds to 59% of the Brazilian territory and encompasses the area of eight states (Acre, Amapá, Amazonas, Mato Grosso, Pará, Rondônia, Roraima and Tocantins). The alerts are made by Deter, which produces daily signals of changes in forest cover for areas larger than three hectares, both for fully deforested areas and for those in the process of forest degradation (by logging, mining, burning and others). The data may change until the completion of the data analysis by Inpe, which usually reviews the influence of factors such as cloud cover on the measurement of the rates. So far, at 121 km² - an area the size of the city of Niterói -, the rate this year was only above the 2017 and 2021 marks, when the index reached 58 and 83 km², respectively. The Minister for the Environment and Climate Change, Marina Silva, criticized the environmental policy of recent years and stressed the new government's commitment to zero deforestation in the biome, one of President Lula's campaign promises. Despite this one-time drop, deforestation in the Amazon grew by 59.5% during the four years of former president Jair Bolsonaro's (PL) administration, the highest percentage increase in a presidential term since satellite measurements began in 1988.

2023-01-04,Amazon: more than 80% of protected areas are threatened,71,"By 2023, if the pace of logging is not stopped, the Amazon Rainforest may lose another 11,805 km² of native forest, according to an estimate by the artificial intelligence platform PrevisIA. The size of almost 10 cities in Rio de Janeiro, the predicted devastation will cause even more emissions of greenhouse gases, which are related to the greater frequency and intensity of extreme weather phenomena. Among them are heavy rains, cold and heat waves and prolonged droughts. Developed by Imazon in partnership with Microsoft and Fundo Vale, the tool has already shown an accuracy of almost 80% in predicting deforestation in 2022, which consolidates it as a relevant technology to assist forest protection actions. To validate how accurate PrevisIA was, the researchers crossed the areas that the platform predicted to be at risk of deforestation between August 2021 and July 2022 with the devastation registered by Imazon's Deforestation Alert System (SAD) in the same period. And the result was that 78.2% of the destruction occurred within 4 km of the area indicated by the platform. If this happens, the platform estimates that 2023 will have the second largest deforestation since 2008, second only to 2021. Like Prodes, the federal system that annually monitors deforestation in the Amazon, PrevisIA's risk calculation takes into account the so-called ""deforestation calendar"", which runs from August of one year to July of the following year. Among the nine states that make up the Legal Amazon, the most critical in relation to the risk of deforestation in 2023 are the three largest: Pará, Amazonas and Mato Grosso. Together, they represent 73% of the area under threat of deforestation in 2023 (8,582 km²), according to PrevisIA. This means that state governments will also need to act to prevent this estimate from being realized. Next is Acre, which despite being the second smallest state in the Legal Amazon presented the fourth largest area at risk of deforestation in PrevisIA: 1,269 km². The fifth largest area under threat is Rondônia, 1,094 km², a state that, like Acre, borders Amazonas. On the tool's map it is possible to see that the forests under greatest risk in these states are precisely on their borders, where there is an area of agricultural expansion called Amacro. Besides the states, PrevisIA also points out the municipalities with the forest areas under the greatest risk of devastation in 2023. Among the first 10, half are in Pará. Of the 803 protected areas in the Amazon (indigenous lands, conservation units and quilombola territories), 653 are at risk of deforestation in 2023, according to PrevisIA. This represents 81% of all protected territories. Regarding the total area at risk in the Amazon, 1,806 km² (15%) are within protected areas. The most threatened are the conservation units, where 1,357 km² of forest are at risk of being cut down. Next are the indigenous lands, with 433 km², and the quilombola territories, with 16 km².

2023-03-10,Amazon and Cerrado record deforestation in February,72,"Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon and Cerrado reached record levels in February, according to official data released on Friday (10), which show President Lula's challenges to reverse environmental destruction. Satellite images detected 322 km2 of destroyed forest cover in the Brazilian part of the largest tropical forest on the planet, an increase of 62% compared to February 2022, which had already been a record, according to the DETER surveillance system, of the National Institute for Space Research (INPE). In the Cerrado, 558 km2 were destroyed, 99% more than in the same period last year and almost double the record of 283 km2 in February 2020. The figures, however, are not surprising, since the highest level had already been recorded on February 17. Nevertheless, the new index is unfavorable for President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who is counting on the support of the international community to reverse the destruction recorded during the term of Jair Bolsonaro (2019-2022). Lula assured that ""Brazil is back"" to fighting climate change, after four years in which the average annual deforestation in the Amazon increased 75% compared to the previous decade. So far, the president has mobilized environmental protection agencies, relaunched a forest protection program, and obtained international support to reactivate the Amazon Fund, which has more than US$ 580 million (about R$ 3 billion) to combat deforestation. Environmental groups have been showing patience with the new government, while waiting for data about the dry season, which begins in July, when deforestation tends to increase. ""It's difficult to reverse the damage of an anti-environmental policy in such a short time,"" said Frederico Machado, from the NGO WWF-Brazil. ""The reduction of deforestation will only occur when there is a consistent reversal of the weakening of the institutions responsible for enforcement,"" he added in a statement. Greenpeace Brazil spokesman Rômulo Batista celebrated the government's efforts, but warned that Lula will have to implement new strategies. ""Much more work will be needed,"" he said."
2023-01-29,Amazon at risk: degradation equivalent to ten times the size of the United Kingdom,73,"A report by the scientific journal Science revealed that forest fires, illegal logging and other human activities have degraded more than a third of the world's forests, an extension equivalent to the surface of the United Kingdom multiplied by ten. A group of 35 scientists worked on the diagnosis, which focuses on the environmental policies to be implemented in this region, considered the ""lungs of the planet"". Degradation differs from deforestation in that the use of the affected land does not change - that is, it continues to be forest - despite the disappearance of most of the trees and vegetation. At least 2.5 million square kilometers of the forested area, 38 percent, was affected, temporarily or permanently, by this phenomenon in less than 20 years.  The amount of pollutant emissions resulting from this process, the experts found, is equal to, or even greater than, that produced by deforestation. ""Despite the uncertainty about the total effect of these alterations, it is clear that their cumulative effect may be just as important as deforestation in terms of carbon emissions and biodiversity loss,"" explained one of the authors, Jos Barlow, in a statement. The researchers warned that anthropogenic changes are occurring ""much faster"" than previously thought, and much more so than natural environmental changes in the past. ""Most analyses of land-use change in the Amazon rainforest have focused on the causes and effects of deforestation. However, anthropogenic disturbances also cause degradation of the Amazon rainforest and threaten its future,"" they said. In this line, they estimated that these four factors will continue to produce large amounts of polluting emissions, even if deforestation of the Amazon is totally eliminated, so they proposed to create specific monitoring systems that take into account these threats to the environment, in addition to suppressing logging. ""While some disturbances can be addressed by curbing deforestation, others, such as limiting the increase in extreme droughts, require additional measures, including global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,"" the researchers said.

2023-02-10,Amazon deforestation alerts drop by 61% this year,74," The accumulation of deforestation alerts in January 2023 in the Legal Amazon was 167 km², the fourth lowest mark for the month in the historical series of the Real-Time Deforestation Detection System (Deter), which began in 2015. The survey was released on Friday morning (10/2) by the Special Research Institute (Inpe). If this result is compared with January last year, there was a 61% drop. The same period in 2022 marked 430 km² of deforestation. The Legal Amazon corresponds to 59% of the Brazilian territory, and encompasses the area of eight states: Acre, Amapá, Amazonas, Mato Grosso, Pará, Rondônia, Roraima, Tocantins and part of Maranhão. The alerts are made by Deter, which produces daily signals of changes in forest cover for areas larger than three hectares, both for fully deforested areas and for those in the process of forest degradation (by logging, mining, burning and others). At 167 km², this year's rate was only above the marks for 2017, 2019, and 2021, when the rate reached 58, 136, and 83 km², respectively.

2023-01-27,"Amazon deforestation drops in January, according to partial data from Inpe",75,"The Amazon lost 99 km² of forest in January of this year, according to data from Deter, an alert system from Inpe (National Institute for Space Research), published on Friday (27). Updated to the 20th, the numbers should still increase by the end of the month, but are well below the 430 km² recorded in January last year, under former president Jair Bolsonaro (PL). The number so far is the third lowest in the recent historical series of Deter (Deforestation Detection System in Real Time), which began in 2015. It is above 2017, which recorded 58.2 km², and 2021, with 82.8 km² of forest cut down. The indicators are the first in the government of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (PT), which has Marina Silva (Rede) who returned to the command of the Environment portfolio 15 years after her first passage and in a much more complex context for the fight against deforestation. With weakened enforcement in recent years, criminal organizations have increased gold mining on indigenous lands, land grabbing and illegal timber schemes. Still, the Lula government needs to face this scenario in order to fulfill the promises of zero deforestation and emissions reduction, reinforced in his inauguration speech and even before. In November of last year, the then president-elect went to COP27, the UN (United Nations) climate conference held in Egypt, and signaled that his government would be different from Bolsonaro's, marked by friction with the international community and with foreign sources of funds, such as the Amazon Fund. The first operations against deforestation in the Amazon started last week, when Ibama agents led raids against deforestation in Acre, Pará and Roraima. On January 16, Funai (National Foundation of Indigenous Peoples) revoked the normative instruction that made logging on indigenous lands more flexible, allowing non-indigenous people to participate in the management. The government is also counting on donations from the Amazon Fund, reactivated on January 1st of this year, to resume inspection. On January 18, Marina Silva said at the World Economic Forum in Davos that the fund's donor base can be expanded to reinforce the fight against environmental crimes."
2023-01-07,Amazon deforestation hits record in Bolsonaro administration,76," The Amazon forest lost 218.41 square kilometers (km²) of vegetation in December last year, the last under then-President Jair Bolsonaro's (PL) administration, in yet another record of his administration. The data are from Deter, a system of the National Institute for Space Research (Inpe) that issues alerts to combat deforestation in real time. The record is Bolsonaro's highest for the month of December, compared with the same period in previous years as president. If considered the historical series, starting in 2015, it is the third, behind 2017, which recorded 287.51km², and 2015, which had 266.29km². The numbers are yet to be updated by Inpe, since the information published this Friday (6/1) goes up to December 30th last year - there is one day left to complete the year 2022, therefore. The number more than doubled compared to the same period last year, when the system recorded 87.19km², but caution must be exercised in comparisons, according to Mariana Napolitano, conservation manager at WWF-Brazil.  ""So,"" she says, ""the trend projected by Deter is that deforestation data will remain high and will be confirmed in the next publication of Prodes, another Inpe system."" This is also what the Climate Observatory, a network of several civil society organizations, points out. ""Amazon destruction alerts have hit historic records in recent months, leaving the Lula government with a kind of contracted deforestation, which will negatively influence the figures for 2023,"" says Marcio Astrini, executive secretary of the entity. ""The Bolsonaro government is over, but its harmful environmental legacy will still be felt for a long time. In her inauguration speech last Wednesday, the Minister of the Environment and Climate Change, Marina Silva, announced the creation of an extraordinary secretariat exclusively focused on controlling and combating deforestation. It was during her first term in the ministry in the government of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (PT) that deforestation, with the PPCDAm -or Action Plan for Prevention and Control of Deforestation in the Legal Amazon-, reached an 83% reduction in the rate from 2004 to 2012. According to Napolitano, the restructuring of command and control actions and agencies such as Ibama and ICMBio are important, but the government will need to make a quick effort in the direction of the economy. ""We know that you can't hold and don't want to hold [deforestation] with command and control. What we want is a forest-based economy, in which deforestation no longer makes sense, because keeping the forest standing is more profitable. It is much less risky for everyone,"" he says. The deadline, however, is another challenge: ""We can remember that, with Marina and the PPCDAm, there was a reduction in deforestation in eight years. We don't have eight more years to reduce, we need effort and resources for the response to be more drastic. It is a more critical scenario for climate, water resources, our window for change is smaller"", highlights the specialist. Until the closing of this edition, the Ministry of the Environment had not commented on the new Deter data. "
2023-01-13,Amazon deforestation increased 150% in the last month of Bolsonaro's term in office,77,"Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon increased by 150% in December 2022, Jair Bolsonaro's last month as president of Brazil, compared to the same period of the previous year, according to data analyzed by the Deforestation Detection in Real Time System (DETER), managed by Brazil's National Institute for Space Research. Specifically, the satellites observed the loss of vegetation in 218.4 square kilometers of Amazonian forests last December, while in December 2021 the losses were 87.2 square kilometers. Overall, during 2022, the Brazilian part of the Amazon basin recorded a loss of 10,267 square kilometers of forested areas, the worst figure since, in 2015, the monitoring of this type of data with satellite images began. Until now, the first position in this deforestation ranking was occupied by 2019 (Jair Bolsonaro's first year in office), in which 9,178 square kilometers of forests were deforested in this part of the Amazon basin. Lábrea and Apuí, in the south of the Brazilian Amazon, head the ranking of municipalities with the largest deforested area from August to December 2022. These towns are located on the axis of BR-319 (Manaus-Porto Velho), a highway designed in the 1970s by Brazil's military dictatorship and recovered during the mandate of Jair Bolsonaro. The previous license for the paving of an important part of this road was granted last June, disregarding the opinions of technicians from Brazil's own Ministry of the Environment.  Logging until the last minute Several environmental organizations had warned that burning, logging, land movements and agricultural and mining occupations would increase between the election of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva as president of Brazil and his inauguration. As will be recalled, Lula da Silva has promised that one of the priorities of his government will be to curb deforestation in the Amazon, as he already did during his first two terms in office (2003-2010). ""Bolsonaro's government may be over. but his nefarious environmental legacy will be felt for a long time,"" Marcio Astrini, executive secretary of the Climate Observatory, a coalition of environmental groups in Brazil, has lamented in a statement."
2023-03-09,"Amazon deforestation linked to reduced Tibetan snows, Antarctic ice loss: Study",78,"Mar 08, 2023( Mongabay News: http://news.mongabay.com Delivered by Newstex)   Earth's climate is controlled by a complex network of interactions between the atmosphere, oceans, lands, ice and biosphere. Many elements in this system are now being pushed toward tipping points, beyond which changes become self-sustaining, with the whole Earth system potentially shifting to a new steady state.A recent study analyzed 40 years of air temperature measurements at more than 65,000 locations to investigate how changes in one region rippled through the climate system to affect temperatures in other parts of the globe. Computer models then simulated how these links may be affected by future climate change.Researchers identified a strong correlation between high temperatures in the Amazon Rainforest and on the Tibetan Plateau.  They found a similar relationship between temperatures in the Amazon and the West Antarctic Ice Sheet.Deforestation in the Amazon likely influences the Tibetan Plateau via a convoluted 20,000-kilometer (12,400-mile) pathway driven by atmospheric and oceanic circulation patterns. The study suggests that a healthy, functioning Amazon is crucial not only for the regional climate in Brazil, but for the whole Earth system. There's a recent saying, grown popular among climate scientists: 'What happens in the Arctic doesn't stay in the Arctic[1].' Now, new research adds to our understanding that, likewise, what happens in the Amazon Rainforest doesn't stay there.  Researchers reporting in Nature Climate Change last month found that deforestation in the Amazon Rainforest may have knock-on effects for the climate in distant regions[2], potentially pushing key elements of the global climate system — on the Tibetan Plateau and the West Antarctic Ice Sheet — closer to climatic tipping points that could be catastrophic for humanity and our planet's biodiversity.  Earth's climate is controlled by a complex network of interactions between its atmosphere, oceans, land, ice and biosphere. Scientists have identified many elements of this system that humanity's actions are presently pushing toward thresholds[3], or tipping points, beyond which changes become self-sustaining — ultimately causing the whole Earth system to shift into a new state possibly hostile to life in its current forms.  'Earth system components that have a critical threshold beyond which a system reorganizes are called tipping elements,' explained study co-author Jingfang Fan, an Earth system scientist at Beijing Normal University in China and the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) in Germany. These tipping elements include the Amazon Rainforest biome[4], the East and West Antarctic ice sheets[5], the Arctic permafrost[6], and the Great Barrier Reef[7], among others[8]. It is theorized that a tipping point reached in one region could trigger a tipping point in another, and so on, like toppling dominoes.  Researchers identified a relationship between temperatures in the Amazon and over the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, both of which are key tipping elements in Earth's climate system. Scientists are concerned that the Antarctic ice sheet may have already entered a state of irreversible decline. Image by NASA Goddard Photo and Video via Flickr[9] (CC BY 2.0[10]). The Arc of Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon, a vast swath of former rainforest intruded on by roads, dams and mines, and converted to cattle ranches, soy plantations and other monoculture croplands. This deforestation is contributing to the drying out of the Amazon, possibly leading to the eventual death of the rainforest and conversion of the biome into degraded savanna. Image courtesy of KBHS Social Sciences.  To investigate how different tipping elements in the global climate system may be interconnected, researchers analyzed 40 years of hourly near-surface air temperature measurements accumulated by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecast, across a global grid of more than 65,000 locations, or nodes.  This immense network of data allowed scientists to investigate how changes in one region appear to ripple through the climate system to affect temperatures in other parts of the globe, by comparing the relationships between temperatures at nodes within the Amazon Rainforest with nodes in other regions. The researchers then used computer simulations to model how climate change might affect these connections between various tipping elements through the end of the 21st century.  'This is the first time that the [mathematical] theory of complex networks has been applied in the context of [far distant] tipping points,' said Teng Liu, a Ph.D. researcher in complex systems at Beijing Normal University, who performed the study. 'We found that the Amazon Rainforest exhibits significant teleconnection with other tipping elements.'  The research team identified a strong correlation between temperature anomalies — where regional conditions buck the global trend — in the Amazon Rainforest and the Tibetan Plateau, roughly 15,000 kilometers (9,300 miles) distant. These anomalies allowed the authors to distinguish between the global trend of climatic warming and direct climate connections between distant regions.  The data showed that anomalously warm temperatures in the Amazon and Tibet have coincided over the last 40 years. They found a similar relationship between temperature in the Amazon and on the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, a key tipping element in Earth's climate system.  Simulations of future climate change carried out by the researchers indicated that these connections are likely to be maintained to 2100. These computer models also showed that future extreme climate events in the Amazon and the Tibetan Plateau are likely to be synchronized.  This mathematical study demonstrated that 'if you lost the Amazon [biome,] or if you disrupt the Amazon, there's further knock-on implications elsewhere in the world,' said Tim Lenton, director of the Global Systems Institute at the University of Exeter in the U.K., who was not involved in the study. 'Any advance in credibly mapping out these couplings between tipping elements gives us a richer picture of the kind of non-linear coupled dynamics of the Earth as a system.' Scientists agree that precisely detecting actual tipping points is impossible until you've passed through them, and can only be fully confirmed in hindsight.  The water-cycling capabilities of forests are responsible for generating roughly half the annual rainfall in the Amazon. But concerns have grown that with continued loss and degradation of the rainforest due to human activities, the Amazon biome is transitioning into a new, drier state[11], potentially causing the remaining forest to die out[12] and be replaced by savanna, with profound rippling impacts for the global climate system.  The water-cycling capabilities of forests are responsible for generating roughly half the annual rainfall occurring in the Amazon, but concerns are growing among scientists that continued deforestation and forest degradation there could cause the remaining forest biome to collapse and be replaced by savanna. Such a tipping point event would result in a massive release of carbon stored in rainforest trees and soils, worsening climate change regionally and planetwide. Image 2011CIAT/NeilPalmer via Flickr[13] (CC BY-SA 2.0[14]). Long-distance climate connections  Analyzing their data, the researchers say that deforestation (most of it due to intentionally set fires) in the Amazon may be responsible for the long-distance connection with conditions on the Tibetan Plateau, carried out via atmospheric and oceanic circulation patterns. That connection follows a convoluted, meandering 20,000-km (12,400-mi) pathway that carries air from central South America to the southern coast of Africa, then north, through eastern Africa, finally veering west through the Middle East to the Himalayas, where it reaches the Tibetan Plateau.  'Wind or ocean currents may carry dust or black carbon particles generated by the burning of the Amazon forest, which could then be transported to the Tibetan Plateau via this pathway,' helping warm the atmosphere over Tibet and melt snow, explained Fan. Further research will be needed to confirm and better define these pathways and the intercontinental climate connections they underpin.  The researchers found evidence that 'snow cover in the Tibetan Plateau has been losing stability since 2008, which implies that [it] is an activated tipping element,' said Liu. While the Tibetan Plateau may be close to its tipping point, 'we don't know what kind of new state the Tibetan Plateau will remain in if it crosses the threshold,' Fan warned.  According to the new study, climate conditions in the Amazon Rainforest influence climate and snow cover on the Tibetan Plateau. Warmer temperatures in the Amazon have coincided with warmer temperatures in Tibet over the last 40 years. Image by NASA Johnson via Flickr (CC BY-NC-ND 2.0).  Lenton said it remains unclear whether passing such a threshold on the Tibetan Plateau would lead to the kind of self-sustaining feedback loop that is the defining characteristic of a tipping element, but he agreed that 'abrupt change on the Tibetan Plateau would have quite significant impacts regionally and [likely lead to] climate feedbacks as well.'  The study adds to a growing weight of evidence that a healthy, functioning ecosystem in the Amazon is crucial, both for the regional climate in Brazil and other South American nations, and also for the whole Earth system. But forecasting exactly when regional tipping points will be reached, and how these regional climatic dominoes may fall, is extremely difficult to determine — though this study aids in connecting some global climatic dots. What is certain is that we are changing Earth in dangerous ways.  Lenton believes that an expanded market for genuine carbon credits[15] in the Amazon could be the 'ultimate savior' for preserving this vital, yet vulnerable ecosystem.

2023-03-08,Amazon deforestation reduces rainfall in South America,79,"Specialists have been talking for decades about the cause-and-effect relationship between the logging of the Amazon and the reduction of rainfall periods in flow and frequency. When miners, loggers and ranchers cleared the rainforest at record rates, scientists were already warning of the consequences. However, researchers are still learning about the effects that human actions in the forests have on the balance of local and global climate. British scientists provided what they called ""compelling evidence"" about these actions for the first time. They have been able to demonstrate a link between deforestation and declining rainfall in the tropics as a whole. ""Local people living near deforested regions often report a warmer and drier climate after forests are cleared. But until now this effect has not been seen in rainfall observations,"" explained study co-author and project supervising professor Dominick Spracklen from the School of Earth and Environment at the University of Leeds, U.K. ""Our paper shows the critical importance of tropical forests in maintaining rainfall. The study, just published in Nature, established this crucial link by looking at satellite data on deforestation and rainfall in three key tropical forest regions: the Amazon, Congo and Southeast Asia. All of these regions had experienced significant deforestation between 2003 and 2017, the period observed by the scientists. The researchers analyzed rainfall records in both deforested areas and where the forest had remained unlogged. In their analysis, they found that deforested sites were drier, even during the dry season, when every drop of rain counts. In the rainy season, rainfall fell as much as 0.6 millimeters per month for every percentage point of clearing. The study authors also looked at how far the impacts of deforestation would reach, on a scale of 25 to 40,000 square kilometers. In that analysis they found that the effects increased with the greatest amount of land included, with no discernible effects within 10 square miles (16 square kilometers) of deforestation, but with a reduction in monthly precipitation of 0.25 millimeters per percentage point of forest cleared within 25,000 square kilometers. Although the study does not prove that deforestation is causing the decline in precipitation, it provides evidence for a long-standing hypothesis that forest loss reduces precipitation because it means there is less evapotranspiration, the word that describes what happens when water from leaves ascends into the atmosphere. If true, this could have serious consequences for both tropical forests and the people and animals that depend on them. ""Tropical forests play a critical role in the hydrological cycle by helping to maintain local and regional rainfall patterns,"" said the study's lead author and PhD researcher at the University of Leeds, Callum Smith. Reduced rainfall caused by tropical deforestation will affect people living nearby through increased water scarcity and reduced crop yields."" The conclusions of this study are also not good for the forests themselves. ""Loss of precipitation can trigger other deforestation feedback loops, such as increased risk of forest fires, as well as hindering the forests' ability to store carbon and damaging their biodiversity,"" Smith added. The team also analyzed the potential future of Congo's rainforest and found that, if current rates of deforestation persist until 2100, rainfall in the region could decrease by 8 to 10 percent. However, there is a silver lining: the evidence that deforestation leads to local rainfall loss also makes an important short-term case for forest conservation. For every percentage point of rainfall reduced, crop yields can fall by 0.5 percent. Given that agriculture is the driver of nearly 90 percent of global deforestation, these findings may raise doubts among farmers about cutting down trees. ""Demonstrating the local benefit of keeping tropical forests standing for the people who live nearby has important policy implications,"" Smith said. I hope our work will provide a strong incentive for policy and decision makers within tropical nations to conserve tropical forests to help maintain a cooler and wetter local climate, with benefits for agriculture and people nearby,"" he concluded. J. C. A. Baker, another member of the University of Leeds team, also participated in the research.

2023-03-23,Amazon rainforest deforestation is influencing weather in Tibet,80," March 23 -- An international team of climate scientists has found evidence suggesting that deforestation in the Amazon rainforest is influencing weather in Tibet, more than 15,000 kilometers away. In their paper published in the journal Nature Climate Change, the researchers describe possible long-range impacts of deforestation of the Amazon rainforest. Valerie Livina, with the U.K.'s National Physical Laboratory, has published a News & Views piece in the same journal issue outlining the Hopf bifurcation theory and how it relates to climate tipping points and the work done by the team on this new effort.   The Amazon rainforest is considered to represent one of the world's tipping points, where small, gradual changes can eventually lead to a large, sudden, permanent change. As deforestation progresses, it edges ever closer to this tipping point, at which point scientists believe the rainforest cannot be returned to its natural state, even if all of the cutting was stopped and the trees replanted. In this new effort, the researchers note that cutting down the forest has been going on for decades, and climate data has been gathered during the same time period. They wondered what impact the slowly diminishing rainforest might have on distant regions around the globe. To that end, they obtained and analyzed global climate data covering the years 1979 to 2019, looking for associations. They were surprised to find that due to tree loss, warmer temperatures in the Amazon correlated with rising temperatures in Tibet and the West Antarctic ice sheet. They also found that when it rained more in the Amazon, there tended to be less precipitation in both of the other two regions. The researchers were able to trace the route of climate change as the size of the rain forest grew smaller. Its approximate path, they saw, could be charted first to southern Africa, and then on up to the Arabian Peninsula and finally over to Tibet. The trip was found to take just a little over two weeks. This finding, the researchers note, suggests that if a tipping point is reached in the Amazon, it could create a tipping point in Tibet, where temperatures and rainfall would be permanently impacted. They note that prior research has already shown that warming is proceeding faster in Tibet and the Arctic than the global average."
2023-02-24,Amazon/Deforestation: February has worst rate of alerts for the month since 2015,81,"Data from the National Institute for Space Research (Inpe), an agency of the Ministry of Science and Technology, indicate that deforestation alerts in the Legal Amazon identified between February 1 and 17 already represent the worst rate for the month since the beginning of the historical series, which began in 2015. According to information from the Real-Time Deforestation Detection System (Deter), the volume of deforestation reached 209 km2 in the period, compared to 199 km2 verified in the month of February last year. The volume is almost double the area deforested in February 2015, for example, when the system captured 115 km2 of devastation. The Legal Amazon is an area that corresponds to 59% of the Brazilian territory and encompasses the entire eight states - Acre, Amapá, Amazonas, Mato Grosso, Pará, Rondônia, Roraima and Tocantins - and part of the state of Maranhão. In January, the number of deforestation had registered a sharp drop compared to the same month in previous years. There were 167 km2 in January 2023, compared to 430 km2 in January 2022. The specialists point out that factors such as strong rainfall can have an influence on the data, besides the offensives against crimes that devastate the forests. Specialists pointed out that at least four months are needed to evaluate the effect of the actions announced by the government on the forest devastation rates. The Deter system alerts serve as a compass for the deforestation issue, pointing out the most devastated areas and guiding the actions of agencies such as Ibama and the Chico Mendes Biodiversity Institute (ICMBio). Last week, in an interview to Estadão, the new president of Ibama, Rodrigo Agostinho, stated that the government's goal is to halve the deforestation rate verified in the previous year. Agostinho said that Ibama is back in action, after years of paralysis during the Jair Bolsonaro (PL) administration, but it is necessary to recover the structure of the agency, which has been emptied. Ibama once had 2,000 inspectors in the field. Currently, it has less than 350 agents to supervise the entire country. The environmental protection and inspection work, said the new president of Ibama, must count not only on resources from the Union, but also from the Amazon Fund and other agencies that have come knocking on the door of the agency, such as the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and the Global Environment Facility (GEF), one of the largest funders of environmental projects in the world. Ibama informed on Thursday evening that the federal base installed two weeks ago in the Palimiú village, on Yanomami land in Roraima, was the target of an attack. Armed criminals broke through the blockade set up on the Uraricoera River and shot at Ibama agents who had boarded one of the boats. The inspectors fired back. In the shootout, one of the miners was wounded. He was arrested by the Federal Police (PF), for attacking public servants and was hospitalized until Thursday night."
2023-01-20,Ambassador confirms German Prime Minister's visit to Brazil,82,"The German ambassador in Brazil, Heiko Thoms, confirmed on Friday (20) that the Prime Minister of Germany, Olaf Scholz, will visit Brazil on the 30th. The date had already been anticipated by President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, but until this Thursday (19) was not confirmed by German diplomatic sources. ""The German Chancellor has just confirmed that he will come to Brazil on January 30,"" wrote the ambassador on his Twitter account. For Thoms, Scholz's visit, the second by a German official in less than a month, is a ""sign of strengthening cooperation"" between the two countries. As Agência Brasil reported this Thursday (19), the German chancellor will travel accompanied by other ministers and representatives of large German companies. Amazon Fund  An important Brazilian trade partner, Germany has shown interest in a political rapprochement with Brazil, with the possibility of allocating more financial resources to fund environmental preservation projects and actions developed in the country, especially in the Amazon. In early January, when President Frank-Walter Steinmeier came to Brazil to attend the inauguration of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, Germany announced the release of 35 million euros to the Amazon Fund, as compensation for the reduction of deforestation in the Amazon biome in 2017. Created in 2008, the fund receives donations from international institutions and governments to finance actions to prevent and combat deforestation in the Legal Amazon. The resources are used to finance projects for reducing deforestation and monitoring the biome. For political reasons, the mechanism was paralyzed during the Jair Bolsonaro administration. Early last November, the Federal Supreme Court (STF) ordered the Brazilian government to reactivate the fund within 60 days. The measure has been fulfilled under the current administration. On his first day at the helm of the Executive Branch, Lula signed Decree 11.368, authorizing the National Bank for Economic and Social Development (BNDES) to resume raising financial donations for the Amazon Fund. Bilateral relations  Besides the environmental area, Lula and Scholz, who is in fact the political leader in Germany, should also deal with ways to expand commercial relations between the two countries and the growth of the extreme right in several countries. Yesterday, during the GloboNews interview, Lula said that he wants to talk to the German chancellor about how the extreme right is growing in Europe and in the world. On the 9th, the German Prime Minister used Twitter to condemn the invasion and depredation of the Planalto Palace, the National Congress, and the Supreme Federal Court (STF) building that occurred the day before in Brasilia.

2023-02-28,Analysis: Deforestation has internationalized the Amazon,83,"The visit to Brazil by the special envoy of the Biden administration, John Kerry, to deal with the participation of the United States in the Amazon Fund, coincided with an increase in forest fires. According to data from the National Institute for Space Research (INPE), a record for the period had been registered by February 17. During the meeting with Vice-President Geraldo Alckmin and the Minister of the Environment, Marina Silva, at Itamaraty, Kerry promised to seek ""huge"" resources for the Fund. During President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva's visit to the White House, President Joe Biden had announced this intention. It is estimated that this participation may reach US$ 50 million. According to the US ambassador to Brazil, Elizabeth Bagley, the amount will be defined in a White House negotiation with the US Congress. The Fund was stopped between 2019 and 2022, under the Bolsonaro government. After Lula's inauguration, it was reactivated and its resources released by donors, mainly Norway and Germany. The European Union (EU) also intends to collaborate. The deforestation of the Amazon during the previous government became a threat to the world, which reacts strongly to this. In practice, Bolsonaro has ""internationalized"" the Amazon, whose impact on global warming is enormous, because of the burning and felling of trees. Zero deforestation is the most efficient and cheapest way to reduce global warming and gain time for the conversion to a green economy. For example: the president of France, Emmanuel Macron, announced last Saturday during the International Agricultural Fair in Paris that the agreement between Mercosur and the EU may go through the roof because of the environmental issue. At COP27, in Egypt, Macron doubled down with Lula, then newly elected, with harsh criticism of still-President Bolsonaro. In fact, the warning is mainly directed at Venezuela, which is now also under pressure from its neighbors. Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay are interested in the agreement. France, because of French Guiana, considers itself ""an Amazonian power"". Macron alludes to the Kourou space center, which hosts the European Space Agency's (ESA) rocket and satellite launching base. The venture generates state-of-the-art technology and IT, as well as jobs. Located on the northern coast of South America, like Suriname and the Republic of Guyana, French Guiana is more like a Caribbean territory than a South American one. It is isolated from the rest of the continent by the Amazon rainforest, as it is mainly populated on the Atlantic strip. The French language and the Creole dialect, also present in the Antilles, are not spoken in the South American countries. As it is a French province, it was also excluded from the treaties between the South American countries, but it represents France in the Association of Caribbean States, along with Martinique and the island of Guadeloupe. It is a European enclave in the subcontinent. Illegal mining With 200 thousand inhabitants, a small consumer market and a vulnerable border, French Guiana has remained isolated, but now suffers from illegal immigrants, mainly Brazilian and Peruvian gold miners, Colombian traffickers and Haitian refugees. Brazil has always given more strategic importance to the cooperation with Guyana than France itself, of which it is a department, because the 760km border between the two countries makes us also neighbors. However, the bridge that would connect Guyana to Amapá, the only Brazilian state that has no land connection with the rest of the country, never got off the drawing board. The strategic connection between Manaus and Georgetown, dreamed of by the military in the 1970s, has not been built either. The connection with Suriname, after the construction of the road from Cayenne to Oiapoque, however, became an open door to Colombian traffickers and Brazilian gold miners - in other words, a problem. The borders between Brazil, Guyana, Suriname, Venezuela and Colombia are practically virtual, which puts into question the effective sovereignty between these countries, even more so since the preservation of the Amazon has become a global problem. Several operations have been carried out by the French government to combat illegal mining in French Guiana. However, after each operation the miners returned. On March 12, 2010, French soldiers and border police were attacked while returning from a successful operation during which they arrested 15 miners, confiscated three boats, and seized 617 grams of gold. However, the miners returned to retrieve their lost loot and colleagues. The soldiers fired warning shots and rubber bullets, but the miners managed to retake one of their boats and about 500 grams of gold. Cooperation with France will be fundamental to curb illegal mining and drug trafficking in the Amazon. Coverage by Correio Braziliense Want to stay on top of the main news from Brazil and the world?

2023-01-26,Beyond deforestation: 38% of the Amazon Rainforest is affected by other forms of degradation,84,"In October 2022, the Amazonas government declared that all 62 municipalities in the state were suffering from a drought that left rivers, such as the famous Solimões, full of sandbars, and the population with difficulty navigating and accessing potable water. At that time, 19 cities were considered in a situation of attention, 41 in alert and two in a stage of emergency - the most serious. The recent example, coming from one of the Brazilian states that are part of the Legal Amazon, shows that the threats that surround the forest go far beyond deforestation. This is the alert of a study published this Thursday (26/01) in the scientific journal Science, one of the most important in the world: other forms of degradation that have human interference already destroy a good part of the forest and should be, by 2050, one of the main sources of carbon emissions, regardless of the increase or decrease in deforestation. The study estimates that 38% of the Amazon Rainforest is today affected by some type of degradation: fires; drought (intensified by climate change) selective logging (legal or illegal; ""selective"" because some commercially interesting trees are removed, leaving others standing) and the so-called edge effects (changes in forests near deforested areas, therefore a direct consequence of deforestation). ""The degraded area in the Amazon and the carbon emissions from degradation are equal to or even greater than those from deforestation,"" David Lapola, a researcher at the Center for Meteorological and Climatic Research Applied to Agriculture at the State University of Campinas (Unicamp) and a doctorate from the University of Kassel, Germany, told BBC News Brazil. The research in Science considered the Amazon area both in Brazil and neighboring countries and was based on previous studies and satellite images. The analyzed period ranges from 2001 to 2018. Authored by 35 Brazilian and foreign researchers, the study differentiates between deforestation and degradation. While, in the former, the forest undergoes major changes to make way for a new use - for example, an area that is burned to turn into pasture -, degradation is different because it involves more contained changes in forest cover and does not aim to transform the use of that land. In scientific production, there is another difference: according to the authors, deforestation has received much more attention than degradation. ""In the Amazon Forest, the extent and long-term effects of such anthropogenic disturbances [degradation] on the terrestrial carbon cycle, ecosystem functioning, and the means of survival of local populations are beginning to be understood and differentiated from the impacts of deforestation,"" says an excerpt from the study, which also has the participation, in addition to Unicamp, of researchers from the Institute for Environmental Research in the Amazon (Ipam) and the National Institute for Space Research (Inpe). - This text was published at https://www.bbc.com/portuguese/geral-64395133"
2023-02-27,"Biden is committed to raising funds to help fight deforestation, says Alckmin",85,"Vice President Geraldo Alckmin (PSB) said on Monday (27) that the United States government is ""committed"" to raising ""huge resources"" to help combat deforestation in the Amazon. However, he said that the amount is not yet defined. He gave an interview after meeting with the U.S. government's special envoy for climate, John Kerry, and classified the meeting as ""very fruitful"". ""The envoy John Kerry did not define the amount, but he said that he will work with the government, with the US Congress and with the private sector so that we can have large resources, not only in the Amazon Fund but also in other forms of cooperation"", he said. The minister of the Environment, Marina Silva, and the president of BNDES (National Bank of Social Economic Development), Aloizio Mercadante, responsible for managing the Amazon Fund, also attended the meeting, which took place at the Itamaraty Palace. In early February, President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (PT) paid a visit to US President Joe Biden. At the time, the White House offered about US$ 50 million for environmental cooperation - the amount was considered disappointing by Brazilian negotiators. On Monday (27), Alckmin showed optimism in relation to the donation of values by the USA to help preserve the Amazon and said that the meeting dealt with issues such as decarbonization, energy transition, deforestation and climate change impacts. The vice president, however, said that it was not discussed what counterpart Brazil would have to give to get the transfer from the U.S. government. ""Brazil's commitment was already clear with the presence of president Lula in the meeting with president Biden, a clear commitment from Brazil to be a major player in the fight against climate change,"" he said.

2023-02-24,Brazil: Deforestation in the Amazon set a record for February,86,"Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon set a record for February, the second month of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva's administration, according to official data available on Friday, which contemplates a little more than half of the period, still unfinished. Satellite monitoring detected 209 km2 of destroyed forest in the Brazilian part of the world's largest rainforest, according to preliminary data from the DETER monitoring system of the National Institute for Space Research (INPE). The area, equivalent to more than 29,000 soccer fields, only contemplates data up to February 17, but already represents an increase in relation to the previous record of 199 km2 destroyed in the entire month of February 2022, the last year of the government of the former ultra-right-wing president Jair Bolsonaro. Last January, satellite monitoring had reported a drop of 61% in relation to the same period of 2022, although environmental organizations had warned that it was premature to speak of a ""trend reversal"", since part of the drop could be related to a greater cloud cover that impaired the calculations. ""The increase in deforestation may be a reflection of the limitation in detection last month due to cloud cover, and what is being observed now perhaps contemplates both the area destroyed this month and also from January,"" Daniel Silva, a conservation specialist with the NGO WWF-Brazil, told AFP. Under the Bolsonaro administration, an ally of agribusiness and climate change denier, average annual deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon increased 75.5% over the previous decade. Experts assure that the destruction is mainly due to the advance of farms and land usurpers who clear the jungle for livestock and crops. Lula, 77 years old, assumed the presidency of Brazil for the third time with the protection of the forest as one of his main banners to enable Brazil to stop being a ""pariah"" in climate issues. The leftist president appointed Marina Silva, a renowned environmentalist who headed the Ministry of the Environment between 2003 and 2008, when Brazil managed to significantly reduce deforestation. On January 24, Silva acknowledged in an interview with AFP that Brazil's environmental reality is ""much worse"" than expected. ""We know that there is an effort by the new government to control deforestation, but concrete results will take time to be seen,"" added the WWF-Brazil expert."
2023-01-21,Brazil: Government starts operations to prevent Amazon deforestation,87,"The first tasks to combat deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon began this week, as one of the first measures of the recently inaugurated President of that country, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, informed the Brazilian Institute for the Environment (Ibama). ""The dispatch of the teams to begin inspection operations began on January 16, 2023. The objective is not to compromise the success of these operations"", said the agency, however, they did not specify the place where the tasks will begin. Lula, who returned to power on January 1 for his third presidential term, promised to put an end to deforestation by 2030, in a context in which devastation in the Amazon broke records during the term of his predecessor, Jair Bolsonaro. Deforestation of the Brazilian rainforest shot up by an average of 75.5 percent annually during Bolsonaro's presidency, between 2019 and 2022, AFP news agency reported. In his statements to GloboNews, Lula said he wants to organize a meeting with the Presidents of the Amazon countries: Ecuador, Colombia, Peru, Venezuela, Bolivia and French Guiana, in order to discuss a continental policy for the preservation of the rainforest. / LMPT La entrada Brasil: Gobierno inicia operaciones para evitar deforestación de la Amazonía fue publicada primero en Periódico La Patria."
2023-01-22,Brazil?s new president takes on Amazon deforestation,88,"RIO DE JANEIRO -- Shaking a traditional rattle, Brazil's incoming head of Indigenous affairs recently walked through every corner of the agency's headquarters -- even its coffee room -- as she invoked help from ancestors during a ritual cleansing.  The ritual carried extra meaning for Joenia Wapichana, Brazil's first Indigenous woman to command the agency charged with protecting the Amazon rainforest and its people. Once she is sworn in next month under newly inaugurated President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, Wapichana promises to clean house at an agency that critics say has allowed the Amazon's resources to be exploited at the expense of the environment.  As Wapichana performed the ritual, Indigenous people and government officials enthusiastically chanted ""Yoohoo! Funai is ours!"" -- a reference to the agency she will lead.  Environmentalists, Indigenous people and voters sympathetic to their causes were important to Lula's narrow victory over former President Jair Bolsonaro. Now, Lula is seeking to fulfill campaign pledges he made to them on a wide range of issues, from expanding Indigenous territories to halting a surge in illegal deforestation.  To carry out these goals, Lula is appointing well-known environmentalists and Indigenous people to key positions at Funai and other agencies that Bolsonaro had filled with allies of agribusiness and military officers.  In Lula's previous two terms as president, he had a mixed record on environmental and Indigenous issues. And he is certain to face obstacles from pro-Bolsonaro state governors who still control swaths of the Amazon. But experts say Lula is taking the right first steps.  The federal officials Lula already has named to key posts ""have the national and international prestige to reverse all the environmental destruction that we have suffered over these four years of the Bolsonaro government,"" said George Porto Ferreira, an analyst at Ibama, Brazil's environmental law-enforcement agency.  Bolsonaro's supporters, meanwhile, fear Lula's promise of stronger environmental protections will hurt the economy by reducing the amount of land open for development, and punish people for activities that previously had been allowed. Some supporters with ties to agribusiness have been accused of providing financial and logistical assistance to rioters who earlier this month stormed Brazil's presidential palace, Congress and Supreme Court.  When Bolsonaro was president, he defanged Funai and other agencies responsible for environmental oversight. This enabled deforestation to soar to its highest level since 2006, as developers and miners who took land from Indigenous people faced few consequences.  Between 2019 and 2022, the number of fines handed out for illegal activities in the Amazon declined by 38% compared with the previous four years, according an analysis of Brazilian government data by the Climate Observatory, a network of environmental nonprofit groups.  One of the strongest signs yet of Lula's intentions to reverse these trends was his decision to return Marina Silva to lead the country's environmental ministry. Silva held the job between 2003 and 2008, a period when deforestation declined by 53%. A former rubber-tapper from Acre state, Silva resigned after clashing with government and agribusiness leaders over policies she deemed to be too lenient.  Silva strikes a strong contrast with Bolsonaro's first environment minister, Ricardo Salles, who had never set foot in the Amazon when he took office in 2019 and resigned two years later following allegations that he had facilitated the export of illegally felled timber.  Other measures Lula has taken in support of the Amazon and its people include:  -- Signing a decree that would rejuvenate the most significant international effort to preserve the rainforest -- the Amazon Fund. The fund, which Bolsonaro had gutted, has received more than $1.2 billion, mostly from Norway, to help pay for sustainable development of the Amazon.  -- Revoking a Bolsonaro decree that allowed mining in Indigenous and environmental protection areas.  -- Creating a Ministry of Indigenous Peoples, which will oversee everything from land boundaries to education. This ministry will be led by Sônia Guajajara, the country's first Indigenous woman in such a high government post.  ""It won't be easy to overcome 504 years in only four years. But we are willing to use this moment to promote a take-back of Brazil's spiritual force,"" Guajajara said during her induction ceremony, which was delayed by the damage pro-Bolsonaro rioters caused to the presidential palace.  The Amazon rainforest, which covers an area twice the size of India, acts as a buffer against climate change by absorbing large amounts of carbon dioxide. But Bolsonaro viewed management of the Amazon as an internal affair, causing Brazil's global reputation to take a hit. Lula is trying to undo that damage.  During the UN's climate summit in Egypt in November, Lula pledged to end all deforestation by 2030. and announced his country's intention to host the COP30 climate conference in 2025. Brazil had been scheduled to host the event in 2019, but Bolsonaro canceled it in 2018 right after he was elected  While Lula has ambitious environmental goals, the fight to protect the Amazon faces complex hurdles. For example, getting cooperation from local officials won't be easy.  Six out of nine Amazonian states are run by Bolsonaro allies. Those include Rondonia, where settlers of European descent control local power and have dismantled environmental legislation through the state assembly; and Acre, where a lack of economic opportunities is driving rubber-tappers who had long fought to preserve the rainforest to take up cattle grazing instead.  The Amazon also has been plagued for decades by illegal gold mining, which employs tens of thousands of people in Brazil and other countries, such as Peru and Venezuela. The illegal mining causes mercury contamination of rivers that Indigenous peoples rely upon for fishing and drinking.  ""Its main cause is the state's absence,"" says Gustavo Geiser, a forensics expert with the Federal Police who has worked in the Amazon for over 15 years.  One area where Lula has more control is in designating Indigenous territories, which are the best preserved regions in the Amazon.  Lula is under pressure to create 13 new Indigenous territories, a process that had stalled under Bolsonaro, who kept his promise not to grant ""one more inch"" of land to Indigenous peoples.  A major step will be to expand the size of Uneiuxi, part of one of the most remote and culturally diverse regions of the world that is home to 23 peoples. The process of expanding the boundaries of Uneiuxi started four decades ago, and the only remaining step is a presidential signature, which will increase its size by 37% to 551,000 hectares ( 2,100 square miles).

2023-03-10,Brazil's Amazon deforestation again hits record high for February,89,"Mar 10, 2023( Al Jazeera English: https://www.aljazeera.com/ Delivered by Newstex)   Deforestation in Brazil's portion of the Amazon rainforest hit a new record high in February, new data has shown, as President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's administration works to end years of widespread devastation.   Satellite monitoring detected 322sq km (124sq miles) of forest cover destroyed in the Brazilian Amazon last month, an increase of 62 percent from the previous record in February 2022, according to data from the national space agency released on Friday.   In the Cerrado, a biodiverse tropical savanna to the south of the Amazon, satellites identified 558sq km (215sq miles) of destruction.   That is up 99 percent from February 2022 and nearly double the previous record of 283sq km (109sq miles) from February 2020, the data showed.   The spike in destruction has underscored the difficulties that Brazil's new president - known as Lula - faces in addressing the rampant deforestation[1] that flourished under his predecessor, Jair Bolsonaro.  The far-right former army captain, who lost a close election run-off to Lula in October of last year, cut environmental enforcement in the Amazon, which environmental and Indigenous groups have blamed for an increase in illegal mining and violence[2].   Bolsonaro's four years in office saw average annual deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon surge[3] by 75 percent compared with the previous decade.   The issue has been of international concern, as the hundreds of billions of carbon-absorbing trees in the Amazon offer a critical buffer in the global fight against climate change.   In November, Lula made a high-profile appearance[4] at the United Nations COP27 climate summit in Egypt, pledging to reassert Brazil's place as an environmental protector and get Amazon deforestation down to zero. 'Brazil is back,' he said.   Lula has taken early action to address the environmental destruction, including rebuilding[5] Brazil's environmental protection agencies, relaunching a defunct national action plan to protect the rainforest and convincing international donors to revive the so-called 'Amazon Fund', which includes more than $580m for anti-deforestation operations.   Following his election victory, Lula also appointed[6] noted environmentalist Marina Silva as the country's minister of environment.  Nevertheless, observers have said reversing the trends will be a slow process.   'It's difficult to reverse the damage of an anti-environmental policy in so little time,' Frederico Machado of the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) Brazil office said in a statement on Friday.   'Reducing deforestation will only happen when there is a consistent strengthening of the institutions responsible for policing it,' he said.   The latest figures came after heartening data[7] from January - Lula's first month in office - showed Amazon deforestation in Brazil had fallen by 61 percent compared with the previous year.   In a presentation last week, a scientist with the space research agency, Inpe, blamed the large month-to-month fluctuations on cloud cover that hid deforestation on satellite images in January, only for it to be revealed in February.   Meanwhile, environment minister Silva last month called the high rate of deforestation shown in early data from February 'a kind of revenge against the actions already being taken'.   She said the level of deforestation was unusual that early in the year, when heavy rains make it difficult for loggers to work in the forest.   'We will keep working towards our goal,' she told reporters.

2023-02-10,Brazil's Amazon deforestation down 61% in January,90,"Brasília: Deforestation in Brazil's Amazon rainforest was down 61 percent in January -- Leftist President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's first month back in the job -- compared with the same period last year, according to an official report published on Friday. Satellite images from the DETER monitoring system showed an area of 167 square kilometers had been destroyed, according to the INPE space research institute. That amounts to the equivalent of 22,000 football pitches, but is a huge decrease on the 430 square kilometers of deforestation in January 2022, when far-right climate change skeptic Jair Bolsonaro was in power. The news came just before Lula was due to meet US President Joe Biden in Washington. Despite the year-over-year drop off in deforestation, the new January figure is still higher than in two of the four years of Bolsonaro's presidency. In 2019 it was 136 square kilometers and just 83 square kilometers in 2021. However, over Bolsonaro's presidency, average annual deforestation increased by 75 percent compared to the previous decade. Bolsonaro instigated policies that favored the agriculture and logging industries, which are mostly responsible for deforestation. Last month's data ""may reflect the resumption of the environmental defense agenda"" that the Lula administration has made a priority, said the Brazilian arm of the World Wildlife Fund (WWF). However, the WWF warned that ""it is too early to talk of a reversal"" of increasing deforestation, not least because it usually peaks in the dry season, beginning in June. ""The action plans for prevention and control of deforestation and forest fires must be restructured as a matter of urgency so that Brazil rediscovers its role as an international environmental leader,"" said Frederico Machado, a conservation specialist at WWF Brazil. He accused Bolsonaro's policies of being ""anti-environmental"" and ""criminal."" Having previously governed Brazil from 2003-10, Lula has promised to rebuild the government agencies tasked with protecting the environment after the severe budget and personnel cuts inflicted on them by Bolsonaro. He has also announced an ambitious goal of zero deforestation by 2030. In order to do so he is counting on international aid, notably through the Amazon Fund, to which Germany and Norway are the main contributors."

This ministry will be led by Sônia Guajajara, the country's first Indigenous woman in such a high government post.  ""It won't be easy to overcome 504 years in only four years. But we are willing to use this moment to promote a take-back of Brazil's spiritual force,"" Guajajara said during her induction ceremony, which was delayed by the damage pro-Bolsonaro rioters caused to the presidential palace.  The Amazon rainforest, which covers an area twice the size of India, acts as a buffer against climate change by absorbing large amounts of carbon dioxide. But Bolsonaro viewed management of the Amazon as an internal affair, causing Brazil's global reputation to take a hit. Lula is trying to undo that damage.  During the UN's climate summit in Egypt in November, Lula pledged to end all deforestation by 2030 and announced his country's intention to host the COP30 climate conference in 2025. Brazil had been scheduled to host the event in 2019, but Bolsonaro canceled it in 2018 right after he was elected. "
2023-02-10,Brazil Amazon deforestation drops in Lula's first month in office,92,"Feb 10, 2023( Al Jazeera English: https://www.aljazeera.com/ Delivered by Newstex)   Deforestation in Brazil's section of the Amazon rainforest[1] dropped by 61 percent in January, the first month in office for left-wing President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who has promised to relaunch environmental protection efforts.  Preliminary satellite data collected by the government's space research agency Inpe and released on Friday showed 167sq km (64sq miles) cleared in the region last month, down from the 430sq km (166sq miles) lost in January 2022.  But experts cautioned that while the decrease was a good sign, it is still too early to say that the deforestation, which surged under Lula's predecessor[2], far-right Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, has been reversed.  'It is positive to see such a relevant drop in January,' WWF-Brasil conservation specialist Daniel Silva said. 'However, it is still too early to talk about a trend reversal, as part of this drop may be related to greater cloud cover.'  WWF-Brasil also pointed out that deforestation usually peaks in the dry season, beginning in June.  'The action plans for prevention and control of deforestation[3] and forest fires must be restructured as a matter of urgency so that Brazil rediscovers its role as an international environmental leader,' said Frederico Machado, another specialist with the group.  Deforestation increased dramatically[4] under Bolsonaro, who was narrowly defeated by Lula in October elections and had promoted more mining and economic development in Brazil's sprawling Amazon region.  Environmental and Indigenous rights groups had blamed the Bolsonaro administration's policies for the increase in deforestation[5] and illicit activities in the Amazon, including illegal gold mining, as well as an uptick in violence against Indigenous communities in the area.  The new deforestation data came as Lula, who previously served as Brazil's president from 2003 to 2010, was scheduled to meet his United States counterpart[6], President Joe Biden, in Washington, DC, later on Friday.  The two leaders are expected to discuss support for democracy, as well as efforts to fight climate change, among other issues.Lula has promised to get deforestation[7] down to zero in the Amazon rainforest, roughly two-thirds of which lies in Brazil.  On the eve of the talks, the Reuters news agency reported that the US was considering its first contribution to a multilateral fund aimed at fighting Amazon deforestation, with a possible announcement coming during the Biden-Lula meeting.  The Brazilian-administered Amazon Fund, supported mainly by Norway and Germany, was reactivated by environment minister Marina Silva[8] the day she took office last month, after being frozen since 2019 under Bolsonaro.  Charred trunks are seen on a tract of Amazon land burned by loggers and farmers, in Porto Velho, Brazil, August 23, 2019 [File: Ueslei Marcelino/Reuters]  In late January, German development minister Svenja Schulze announced that Berlin would make $38m available for the Amazon Fund, saying Lula's administration[9] offered 'a great chance to protect the forest and to offer a new perspective to the people who live there'.  Germany also pledged to provide $87m in low-interest loans for farmers to restore degraded areas and $34m for Brazilian states in the Amazon region to protect the rainforest.  Yet even with the positive start to the year, experts and staff at Brazil's environmental agency Ibama have warned that it may take years for Lula to deliver on conservation targets after Bolsonaro cut funding and staff at key agencies.  Still, the new Brazilian government has already taken some steps in its push to reverse environmental degradation in the Amazon.  Earlier this week, the authorities launched raids[10] to remove illegal gold miners from Indigenous territories in the region, where they have been blamed for violent attacks and a health crisis affecting the Yanomami people.

NA,Brazil chooses the Amazonian city of Belém for COP30 in 2025,93,"The Brazilian government has chosen the Amazonian city of Belem, capital of the state of Para, to host the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP30) in 2025, the President of Brazil announced Wednesday. ""Itamaraty [Ministry of Foreign Affairs] formalized the city of Belem as the city that is disputing the candidacy to hold COP30 in Belem,"" Lula da Silva said in a video shared on social media. ""I hope we will be there to make a beautiful COP,"" he added. Next door, the governor of the state of Pará, thanked the government for the gesture and stressed that Belem has ""open doors"" to discuss the Amazon, ""discuss the world's climate and find solutions."" Lula da Silva had already expressed his desire to host the climate conference last November during his participation in the COP27 in Egypt, which was his first international trip after winning the October elections against Jair Bolsonaro, who was seeking re-election. On January 1, in his inauguration speech, the Brazilian head of state stated that he ""will not tolerate"" the destruction of the Amazon, whose deforestation rates have skyrocketed during Bolsonaro's four-year administration (2019-2022). According to environmental organizations, deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon has increased by 60% during Bolsonaro's administration compared to the previous four years, when Dilma Rousseff and Michel Temer ruled. Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who will hold the presidency of Brazil until January 04, 2027, has also pledged to end illegal mining and to protect indigenous peoples by providing them with more resources to take care of their lands.

2023-01-06,Brazilian Amazon deforestation up 150% in Bolsonaro's last month,94,"Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon rose 150 percent in December from the previous year, according to government figures released Friday, a final bleak report for far-right ex-president Jair Bolsonaro in his last month in office. Satellite monitoring detected 218.4 square kilometers (84.3 square miles) of forest cover destroyed in Brazil's share of the world's biggest rainforest last month, according to the national space agency's DETER surveillance program. The area -- nearly four times the size of Manhattan -- was up more than 150 percent from the 87.2 square kilometers destroyed in December 2021, according to the agency, INPE. Bolsonaro, who was replaced on January 1 by leftist President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, triggered an international outcry during his four years in office for a surge of fires and clear-cutting in the Amazon, a key resource in the race to curb climate change. Under Bolsonaro, an agribusiness ally, average annual deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon rose by 75.5 percent from the previous decade. ""Bolsonaro's government may be over, but his tragic environmental legacy will still be felt for a long time,"" Marcio Astrini, executive secretary of the Climate Observatory, a coalition of environmental groups, said in a statement. It was the third-worst December on record for the eight-year-old DETER program, after 2017 and 2015. Deforestation in 2022 was also at or near record highs during the crucial dry-season months of August, September and October, when clear-cutting and fires often surge because of drier weather. Experts say the destruction is mainly driven by farms and land grabbers clearing the forest for cattle and crops. Lula presided over a sharp drop in deforestation when he previously led Brazil from 2003 to 2010. He has vowed to reboot Brazil's environmental protection programs, fight for zero deforestation and ensure the South American giant stops being a ""pariah"" on climate issues."
2023-01-23,"Brazilian President Lula Starts Work On Amazon Deforestation, Launches Logging Raids",95,"Jan 23, 2023( Latin Times: http://www.latintimes.com Delivered by Newstex)   Anti-illegal logging raids led by the Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (IBAMA), in Brazil started on Thursday. President Lula da Silva has soughtto fulfilhis many promises to stop the deforestation of the Amazon rainforest and increase the rights and protections of indigenous tribes in the area.  IBAMAenvironmental enforcement coordinator Tatiane Leite said that the agency was launching anti-illegal logging raids in the states of Roraima, Acre, and Para as a sustained effort to reduce the amount of illegal logging being done by loggersand ranchers in the Amazon, according to Climate Home News[1].  Agents and federal police went with reporters to the state of Para, where they found five different areas in the Cachoeira Seca indigenous reserve that appeared to have been burned and deforested around October of last year. Four of them, in the process of being turned into ranches, were reportedly abandoned after Lula was elected President.  Another area was reportedly found with a newly-built house as well as chainsaws, other equipment, and even stocks of food. Agents believed that there were people in that area before they fled just before IBAMA's arrival to escape.  Lula largely was able to win Brazil's presidency on the backs of environmentalists and indigenous people, promising to stop the deforestation of the Amazon and expand the rights and lands of indigenous tribes in the country, the Associated Press[2] reported.  One of the ways he has been able to do so was to appoint individuals from indigenous tribes in high government positions focused on their affairs.Joenia Wapichana was appointed the head of National Indian Foundation or Funai, which carries out the policies for indigenous tribes as well as for the Amazon rainforest.  Beyond that, he is also planning on signing a decree to revitalize the Amazon Fund, which was gutted during the presidency of Jair Bolsonaro. He has also created the new--Ministry of Indigenous Peoples, focused on the welfare and needs of indigenous people in the country.'It won't be easy to overcome 504 years in only four years. But we are willing to use this moment to promote a take-back of Brazil's spiritual force,' Sônia Guajajara, the appointed head of the Ministry of Indigenous Peoples, said.   Representation image.

2023-01-29,"Can intensification of cattle ranching reduce deforestation in the Amazon? Insights from an agent-based social-ecological model (Updated January 29, 2023)",96,"2023 FEB 10 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at NewsRx Science Daily -- According to news reporting based on a preprint abstract, our journalists obtained the following quote sourced from osf.io:  “Deforestation in the Amazon with its vast consequences for the ecosystem and climate is largely related to subsequent land use for cattle ranching.  “In addition to conservation policies, proposals to reduce deforestation include measures to intensify cattle ranching.  “However, the effects of land-use intensification on deforestation are debated in the literature. This paper introduces the abacra model, a stylized agent-based model to study the interplay of deforestation and the intensification of cattle ranching in the Brazilian Amazon. The model combines social learning and ecological processes with market dynamics.  “In the model, agents adopt either an extensive or semi-intensive strategy of cattle ranching based on the success of their neighbors. They earn their income by selling cattle on a stylized market. We present a comprehensive analysis of the model with statistical methods and find that it produces highly non-linear transient outcomes in dependence on key parameters like the rate of social interaction and elasticity of the cattle price. We show that under many environmental and economic conditions, intensification does not reduce deforestation rates and sometimes even has a detrimental effect on deforestation. Anti-deforestation policies incentivizing fast intensification can only lower deforestation rates under conditions in which the local cattle market saturates.”  This preprint has not been peer-reviewed.

2023-02-20,"Cattle Found Responsible For The Deforestation Of The Amazon In Colombia, Says Report",97,"Feb 20, 2023( Latin Times: http://www.latintimes.com Delivered by Newstex)   Cattle-ranching, not cocaine, has driven the destruction of the Colombian Amazon over the last four decades, a new study has found. This is a representational image. Karen Murray/Gettyimages  A recent study states that the deterioration of the Colombian Amazon over the past 40 years has been caused by cattle ranching rather than cocaine.  Research reveals that in 2018, the quantity of forest removed for the cultivation of coca, the main component of cocaine, was just 1/60th of that used for livestock. However, previous administrations have cited environmental concerns to justify stepping up their assault on the green shrub.  The study's conclusions support conservationists who have long argued that Colombia's approach to protecting the Amazon, which is frequently focused on halting coca cultivation, is misplaced, The Guardian[1] reported.  ""We want to finally eradicate this narrative that coca is the driver of deforestation,"" said Pablo Murillo-Sandoval at the University of Tolima, who led the study.  Once the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc) reached a historic peace accord with the government in 2016 and put down their weapons, deforestation spiked.  Land-grabbers profited as rebels came out of the jungle. Deforestation reached a record high of 219,973 hectares (543,565 acres) in 2017, up 23% from the previous year.  Then-president Ivn Duque used the environmental destruction caused by coca cultivation to justify stepping up military action against coca farmers.  Prohibited from spraying coca crops with glyphosate after the chemical was banned in 2015 for health concerns, the Duque government sent in choppers and armed troops into the Amazon rainforest, sometimes into deadly confrontations with coca farmers.  Yet while cattle ranches cleared more than 3m hectares (7.4m acres) of Amazon rainforest in 2018, coca's impact was negligible.  In 2018, the most recent year included in the study, just 45,000 hectares (111,200 acres) were removed for coca.  Murillo and his coworkers were able to distinguish between the activities on a large scale from 1985 to 2019 using a deep learning algorithm to identify between land utilized for coca and livestock.  ""We have always contested the government's argument that coca was driving deforestation but lacked the evidence,"" said Angelica Rojas, liaison officer for Guaviare state at the Foundation for Conservation and Sustainable Development, a Colombian environmental thinktank.  The study adds to the mounting evidence that Colombia's ""war on drugs"" has failed to stop coca production and, in some circumstances, may have even made it worse despite the loss of many lives and the expenditure of billions of dollars.  According to Murillo, farmers who have their crops destroyed simply construct new plots a few kilometers deeper in the forest canopy.  The authors claim that while the government has been playing whack-a-mole with coca producers, the main cause of deforestation, cattle rearing, has been allowed to engulf enormous tracts of land.  Biodiverse tropical rainforests have been incentivized to be turned into desolate fields due to flaws in Colombian land regulations. Landowners must prove that 75% of their plots are productive in order for their deeds to be recognized, and farmers find it much easier to utilize cows than crops, according to Carlos Devia, a forest engineer at Bogota's Javeriana University who was not involved in the study.  ""Ranching is the easiest way to show you're using land, as it's unregulated. You could have 100 hectares of land and just throw 10 cows in there, whereas for potatoes or corn only a hectare would require a year of great work,"" Devia said.  Many times, landless farmers destroy a few hectares of rainforest and illegally sell them to members of criminal gangs who combine several small lots into large expanses of dead, barren pasture.  Colombian President Gustavo Petro, who took office in August last year, is proposing a U-turn on Colombia's failed anti-narcotics strategy.  Petro, a former member of the defunct M-19 rebel group, has turned the focus away from forced coca eradication and is buying up millions of hectares of land to give to farmers.   2023 Latin Times.

2023-02-19,"Cattle, not coca, drive deforestation of the Amazon in Colombia – report",98,"Cattle-ranching, not cocaine, has driven the destruction of the Colombian Amazon over the last four decades, a new study has found.

Deforestation spiked after the guerrillas of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc) signed a landmark peace agreement with the government in 2016 and laid down their weapons. As the rebels came out of the jungle, land-grabbers took advantage , clearing trees with chainsaws and burning vast areas. Deforestation reached a record high of 219,973 hectares (543,565 acres) in 2017, up 23% from the previous year.

Using a deep learning algorithm to differentiate between land used for coca and cattle, Murillo and his colleagues were for the first time able to distinguish between the activities on a mass scale from 1985 to 2019. “We have always contested the government’s argument that coca was driving deforestation but lacked the evidence,” said Angelica Rojas, liaison officer for Guaviare state at the Foundation for Conservation and Sustainable Development, a Colombian environmental thinktank. “Now we have real data with which we can oppose this mistake.” The figures show that previous governments have used the environment as a false justification to wage war on coca farmers, said Rojas, who was not involved in the study. “They didn’t want to prevent deforestation, they just wanted to justify spending more money and resources on their real political goal: eliminating coca,” she said. The study also adds to evidence that despite lives being sacrificed and billions of dollars being spent, Colombia’s “war on drugs” has failed to halt coca production – and in some cases it may have even made it worse. When farmers have their crops eradicated they simply establish new plots, often just a few kilometres deeper into the forest canopy, Murillo said. “The war on drugs started 40 years ago now, yet everyone knows where coca is: in the same place they have always been.” As the government has engaged in a game of whack-a-mole with coca farmers, the real driver of deforestation, cattle farming, has been allowed to swallow up vast swathes of land, the authors argue. Flaws in Colombian land regulation have incentivised the conversion of biodiverse tropical rainforests into barren pastures. To get their deeds recognised, landowners must demonstrate that 75% of their plots are productive, and it is far easier for farmers to use cows than crops, said Carlos Devia, a forest engineer at Bogotá’s Javeriana University who was not involved in the study. “Ranching is the easiest way to show you’re using land, as it’s unregulated. You could have 100 hectares of land and just throw 10 cows in there, whereas for potatoes or corn only a hectare would require a year of great work,” Devia said. Landless farmers often clear a few hectares of rainforest and sell them illegally to members of criminal organisations who then join up multiple small lots, transforming them into vast swathes of lifeless, arid pasture. Colombian President Gustavo Petro, who took office in August last year, is proposing a U-turn on Colombia’s failed anti-narcotics strategy. Petro, a former member of the defunct M-19 rebel group, has turned the focus away from forced coca eradication, and is buying up millions of hectares of land to give to farmers. “Reducing drug use does not require wars, it needs us all to build a better society,” Petro told the UN general assembly in September last year."
2023-01-31,CCNY Biologist Ana Carnaval Sounds Alarm About Accelerated Deforestation In The Amazon,99,"(TNSjou) -- City College of New York issued the following news: The global climate crisis has altered every ecosystem on planet Earth. In the Amazon, the rate of change is accelerating. The Amazon is home to more than 10% of all named and plant and vertebrate species. It is the core of biogeographic realm that is home to about one-third of all known species. Habitat conversion - driven by logging, forest fires, and canopy clearing, threaten this biodiversity. Global warming, climate variability, and extreme weather events amplify these threats. City College of New York biologist Ana Carnaval along with collaborators from multiple institutions in North America, South America and Europe has determined that these anthropogenic events are pushing the entire Earth System across a critical threshold to a qualitatively different global climate scenario. Their study, entitled: ""Human impacts outpace natural processes in the Amazon,"" appears in the journal ""Science."" Carnaval and her colleagues compared rates of anthropogenic and natural environmental changes in the Amazon to other regions of South America. They then compared these rates with other processes in the larger Earth System. They compiled South America data from the Science Panel for the Amazon (SPA) Assessment Report which details the dimensions of the Amazon as a regional entity of the Earth System and documents Amazonian biodiversity, ecosystem function and cultural diversity. Among other key takeaways, they found the rate at which modern human activity drives extinction in the Neotropics is between 1,000 times and 10,000 times higher than the natural rate as estimated from the fossil record. The Amazon is transitioning from a largely natural to a degraded landscape. After millions of years of serving as a global carbon pool, the Amazon rainforest is poised to become a net carbon source. In some areas, forest respiration and burning are outpacing photosynthesis. Carnaval and her colleagues believe the global community must enhance conservation through legal protections and punish illegal activities for areas under public, private community, and Indigenous management. They call for international financial institutions to suspend funding for mega-infrastructure projects such as roads, bridges, railways, dams and mines in Amazonia pending independent regional environmental assessment. They conclude: ""To fail the Amazon is to fail the biosphere, and we fail to act at our own peril."" * * * JOURNAL: Science https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abo5003 * * * Original text here: https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/news/ccny-biologist-ana-carnaval-sounds-alarm-about-accelerated-deforestation-amazon Contact: Erica Rex, 845/668-0322, erex.ccny.cuny.edu Copyright Targeted News Services MSTRUCK-8056700 MSTRUCK"
2023-04-05,CJ Selecta Accelerates ESG Management to Stop Amazon Deforestation,100,"PR Newswire Completely moving away from purchasing soybeans from the Amazon as part of its Seed Project to preserve the environment  CJ Selecta, the Brazil-based Soy Protein Concentrate (SPC) producer and a subsidiary of South Korea-based CJ CheilJedang, announced on April 5 that it would no longer purchase any soybeans from the Amazon rainforest starting this year. This decision comes just two years after the company declared itself ""deforestation-free"" in 2021, achieving the goal ahead of schedule. Initially, the commitment was set for 2025, but the company managed to accomplish it early on by gradually reducing its soy purchases from the Amazon region. CJ Selecta's Seed Project, launched to replace soybeans sourced from the Amazon, has seen a steady increase in participation, with around 200 farmers currently engaged. The program provides seed and financing to Brazilian farmers outside of the Amazon forest, and commits to purchasing their entire soybean harvest. CJ Selecta has been focused on building a virtuous cycle in which soybeans purchased through the Seed Project can be repurposed after processing. This involves utilizing CJ's fermentation technology to reprocess the byproducts from the processing of the SPC into environmentally-friendly specialty fertilizers and bioethanol. These serve as sustainable alternatives to conventional chemical fertilizers and the gasoline used as fuel for automobiles, respectively. The company aims to reduce its carbon emissions in the entire SPC production. In particular, further cut-down in carbon emissions from inland transportation is expected by shifting its soybean purchases to Minas Gerais, where CJ Selecta is located. CJ Selecta is committed to extending ESG management efforts beyond its own business sites into the wider value chain including its supply chain and partner companies (Scope 3 emissions). At the end of last year, CJ Selecta began supporting farmers in obtaining an international certification from RTRS (Round Table on Responsible Soy Association), a non-profit organization based in Switzerland. RTRS certifies that the soybeans have been produced and transported in an environmentally-responsible manner. This year, the volume of RTRS-certified soybeans is expected to increase by 30 percent from last year, amounting to 60,000 tons. In addition, CJ Selecta has also created an ""agrosatellite"" system that guards against and prevents any intake of soybeans that do not comply with its ESG policy in the purchase of regular soybeans. This system monitors farmland for any potential illegal activities related to soybean cultivation. The Soy Trace app allows customers to also track the entire process of soybean production from harvest to warehouse, ensuring higher transparency and traceability throughout the supply chain.

The initiative was approved last July 14, but the Executive Power observed it, returning it to the Agrarian Commission. The observed document is signed by former President Pedro Castillo and also by the former head of the Council of Ministers, Aníbal Torres. In this sense, they mentioned that this project does not constitute ""an adequate legislation"" that would not protect the Amazon and the national ecosystem. However, the parliamentarians voted in favor of the project, without taking into account the observations made by the former president. Among them was that it ""threatened"" the Amazon. Therefore, it will be debated in the Plenary of the Congress to decide if it will be approved and become law. You may be interested in: Ministry of Environment is against the modification of the Forestry and Wildlife Law. The provision seeks to modify the Forestry and Wildlife Law, precisely in articles 29 and 33. This working group approved it on November 4, 2022. For its part, the Ombudsman's Office also urged the Parliament not to approve the bill promoted by the Teachers' Bloc. The entity pointed out that 80% of deforestation is generated by the agricultural sector, so they ask that land be provided to help ""promote this activity"". What was the Executive's observation? The Executive Branch details that this provision will allow the development of agricultural activities without the authorization of the Ministry of Environment. Therefore, they specify that this portfolio is responsible for approving the forest zoning. ""This regulation could have a greater impact on the forests of the Amazon, being that the process of formalization and titling of rural properties,"" reads the document.

In addition, they warned that this project has no ""technical support"". ""Therefore, the legislative proposal not only contravenes the purpose and objectives of the Forestry and Wildlife Law itself (...) threatening the sustainable development of the Amazon with adequate legislation, and putting at serious risk the right to enjoy a balanced and adequate environment for the development of people's lives,"" they read.

2023-02-26,Data shows worst Feb deforestation for Brazil's Amazon,103,"BRASILIA Brazilian Amazon deforestation reached its worst-ever February level in the second month of President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's presidential term, provisional data showed on Friday.  Surveillance satellites had detected 209 sq km of forest destroyed, according to the INPE space research institute's Deter monitoring system.  This is an area equivalent to about 30,000 football fields.  The INPE report included data only up to Feb 17, but there was already an increase from the previous worst February, in 2022, when far-right leader Jair Bolsonaro was still in office.  In January, Amazon deforestation was down 61 per cent from a year earlier, according to the same source.   But experts warned at the time it was premature to talk of a ""reversal"" of the deforestation trend, partly because some forest loss may have been unobserved due to heavy cloud cover.  The February increase may partly reflect forest losses that were unobserved in January, WWF Brazil expert Daniel Silva told AFP.  Over Mr Bolsonaro's presidency, average annual deforestation increased by 75 per cent compared with the previous decade.  Mr Bolsonaro instigated policies that favoured the agriculture and logging industries mostly responsible for deforestation.  Having previously governed Brazil from 2003 to 2010, Mr Lula took office on Jan 1, 2023, with a promise to rebuild the government agencies tasked with protecting the environment after severe budget and personnel cuts inflicted on them by Mr Bolsonaro. He also announced an ambitious goal of zero deforestation by 2030.  In order to do so, he is counting on international aid, notably through the Amazon Fund, to which Germany and Norway are the main contributors. AFP"
2023-01-06,Deforestation in Brazil's Amazon reached record high in last year of Jair Bolsonaro's presidency,104,"The Brazilian Amazon lost 10,267 kilometers of vegetation cover in 2022, an extension equivalent to that of a country like Lebanon. Thus, deforestation of the world's largest rainforest reached a record level in the last year of President Jair Bolsonaro's administration. The area of rainforest in the Brazilian Amazon devastated last year was 24.9% higher than that destroyed in 2021 (8 219 square kilometers) and the largest since the National Institute of Spatial Studies (INPE) began measuring in 2015 the so-called deforestation alerts, reported this January 6, 2023 the official agency. Management against the environment Until now, the year with the highest deforestation was 2019 (9,178 square kilometers), precisely the first of management of the ultra-right leader. Environmentalists blame the current crisis in the Amazon for his anti-environmentalist rhetoric, his defense of mining even in the reserves. In addition to dismantling the oversight agencies. The data disclosed are measured by Dete; a mechanism that uses satellite images to alert monthly and in real time about threatened areas in the Amazon; but they are less accurate than those of Prodes; a tool that INPE uses to calculate deforestation and whose disclosure is annual. According to the latest Prodes bulletin, released in November, the Amazon lost 11 568 km of vegetation between August 2021 and July 2022, 11.3% less than the previous year (13 038 square km) but the second highest in the last 14 years. Record pace Environmental organizations had already warned that the destruction was growing at a record pace in the last months of 2022 in the expectation that Bolsonaro would be defeated in the October presidential election, which ended up happening. Brazil's new president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who took office on January 1, promised that one of his government's priorities will be to return to minimizing deforestation in the Amazon, as he did in his first administration (2003-2010), and to relentlessly combat illegal logging and mining. His Minister of the Environment, the environmentalist Marina Silva, announced the creation of a secretariat within her portfolio dedicated exclusively to combating deforestation. According to INPE data, between August and December 2022 alone, 4,793 kilometers of forest were cleared in the Amazon, a record amount for the period. In December alone, deforestation extended over 218.4 square kilometers, with a jump of 150% compared to the same month of 2021 (87 square kilometers) and the highest number for this month since the beginning of the previous Government. "" Destruction alerts were record in the last months of 2022, which left the Lula Government a rate that will negatively affect the 2023 numbers,"" since the annual measurement is between August of one year and July of the next, said the executive secretary of the Climate Observatory, Marcio Astrini.

NA,NA,106,"End of Document SAO PAULO, Feb 10 (Reuters) - Deforestation in Brazil's Amazon rainforest fell in January from a year earlier, according to satellite data released on Friday, in what are the first monthly figures under President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's presidency. Preliminary satellite data collected by government space research agency Inpe showed 167 square kilometers (64 square miles) logged in the region last month, down 61% from January 2022, the worst month in the eight-year series. In mid-January, Brazilian environmental agents launched their first anti-logging raids under Lula, who has pledged to halt the increase in deforestation under the government of his predecessor, Jair Bolsonaro. Deforestation in January was also below the historical average of 196 square kilometers for the month since 2016, but the January data may have been influenced by dense clouds over the rainforest earlier in the year. ""It is positive to see such a relevant drop in January,"" said WWF-Brazil conservation specialist Daniel Silva. ""However, it is still early to talk about a change in trend, as part of this decline may be related to higher cloud cover."" The new figures come after Reuters exclusively reported on Thursday that the United States was considering its first contribution to a multilateral fund aimed at fighting Amazon deforestation, with a possible announcement during President Joe Biden's meeting with Lula at the White House on Friday. The Amazon Fund, administered by Brazil and supported mainly by Norway and Germany, was reactivated by Environment Minister Marina Silva on the day she took office last month, after having been frozen since 2019 under Bolsonaro. Even with the positive start to the year, experts and staff at environmental agency Ibama warn that it may be years before Lula meets conservation targets after Bolsonaro cut funding and staff at key agencies.

2023-01-06,"Deforestation in the Amazon has 3rd highest mark for the month of December, and the worst of the Bolsonaro administration",110,"The Amazon forest lost 218.41 km² of vegetation in December last year, the last under the management of former President Jair Bolsonaro (PL), in another record of his government. The data are from Deter, a system from Inpe (National Institute for Space Research), which issues alerts to combat deforestation in real time. The record is Bolsonaro's highest mark for the month of December, compared with the same previous periods. If considered the historical series, starting in 2015, it is the third, behind 2017, which recorded 287.51 km², and 2015, which had 266.29 km². The numbers are still to be updated by Inpe, since the information published this Friday (6) goes up to December 30th of last year. In her inauguration speech last Wednesday (4), the Minister of the Environment, Marina Silva, announced the creation of a special secretariat exclusively focused on controlling and combating deforestation. It was during her first term at the Ministry, in the first mandate of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (PT), that the fight against deforestation, with the PPCDAm, reached an 83% reduction in the deforestation rate between 2004 and 2012. Deforestation is monitored in two ways by Inpe. Besides Deter, whose full name is Real-Time Deforestation Detection System, which publishes information monthly, the data from Prodes (Project for Monitoring Deforestation in the Legal Amazon by Satellite) are released twice a year - the first is an estimate. While the Deter was created to enable faster enforcement actions and combat environmental crimes, the Prodes is the deforestation data itself, monitored by satellite and with greater precision. Nevertheless, the Deter can help indicate trends of growth, fall or maintenance of deforestation in the Amazon. Bolsonaro's administration has also accumulated records in Prodes. For the fourth consecutive year, deforestation in the Amazon, in one year, exceeded 10 thousand km². The program's data, released in November last year, show that 11,568 km² of forest were cut down from August 2021 to July 2022. "
2023-01-18,Deforestation in the Amazon has increased for fifth year in a row,111,"Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon has increased for the fifth year in a row and in 2022 was the largest in the last 15 years. Imazon (Amazon Institute of People and the Environment) unveiled on Wednesday that satellite monitoring detected the devastation of 10,573 square kilometers last year, a record since the institution started monitoring the cutting of the forest, in 2008. The loss is equivalent to 3,000 football fields per day. The institute calculates that 35,193 square kilometers of forest have been suppressed between 2019 and 2022. In the period, the increase is 150% in relation to the previous four-year period. From 2015 to 2018, 14,424 square kilometers of forest were cut down. “We hope that this was the last deforestation record reported by our satellite monitoring system since the new administration has promised to give priority to protecting the Amazon,” said Bianca Santos, a researcher at Imazon, in a note. “For this to happen, it is necessary that the government seeks maximum effectiveness in the measures to combat devastation, such as those already announced for the return of the demarcation of indigenous lands, the restructuring of inspection agencies, and incentives to generate income from standing forest.” December was the month of the greatest loss of forest area, 287 square kilometers, 105% more than in December 2021. It was the worst December since Imazon’s records began. “In the last month of the year, there was an unbridled race to deforest while the gate was open for cattle, for land speculation, for illegal mining, and for deforestation in indigenous lands and conservation units. This shows the size of the challenge of the new administration,” said Carlos Souza Jr., coordinator of Imazon’s Amazon monitoring program. The phrase is a reference to former Environment Minister Ricardo Salles, who in a cabinet meeting, in April 2020, said the Covid-19 pandemic was an “opportunity” to ease environmental rules while society’s focus was on the disease. According to Imazon, 80% of the forest cut down in 2022 was concentrated in federal areas, which means 8,443 square kilometers. In this case, deforestation increased by 2% year-over-year. The state areas deforested were equivalent to only 11% of the total, but showed an increase of 11% compared with the previous year, to 1,130 square kilometers. The remaining 9% occurred in areas without jurisdiction (1,000 square kilometers) and municipal areas (0.2 square kilometers). Of the nine states of the Legal Amazon, deforestation was most intense in Pará (3,874 square kilometers, 37% of the total deforested in the country), Amazonas (2,575 square kilometers, 24%), and Mato Grosso (1,604 square kilometers, 15%). The three states are at the top positions in the ranking of deforestation, in that same order, since 2019, according to Imazon. The only states with an increase in deforestation in 2022 compared to 2021 were Amazonas and Mato Grosso. In Amazonas, the increase was 24%. The state has been facing an increase in deforestation in the region bordering Acre and Rondônia, according to Imazon. This is the area of Apuí, the deforestation champion last year, with 586 square kilometers. (Essa publicação é parte integrante do jornal Valor Econômico e se sujeita aos termos de uso do site.)"
2023-04-07,Deforestation in the Amazon has one of its worst first quarters,112,"Deforestation in the Amazon grew again in March, ending one of the worst first quarters ever recorded during the 100 days of the Lula government, according to official figures released on Friday (7). Satellite images detected 356km² of destroyed forest cover in the Brazilian part of the largest tropical forest on the planet. The data shows an increase of 14% compared to that recorded in March 2022, the last of Jair Bolsonaro's administration, according to the DETER surveillance system of the National Institute for Space Research (INPE). Between January and March this year, the destruction of the Brazilian Amazon was the second highest in the historical series for this period, with 844km² deforested, second only to 2022, when 941km² were destroyed. After four years of Bolsonaro's government, which experts say has weakened regulations and environmental protection agencies, improvement in deforestation rates may take time, Mariana Napolitano, conservation manager at NGO WWF Brazil, told AFP. ""The data show that all the dismantling that happened in the last four years, all the discourse in favor of illegality, greater flexibility in relation to command and control shows that it's a complex scenario that exists in this biome and that it takes time to change, even though the current government has demonstrated its intention to combat deforestation very seriously."" Since his election, Lula has promised to reverse the environmental policies of his predecessor and eradicate illegal deforestation. ""It is necessary to recompose these (environmental) agencies and intensively resume command and control actions to see a real change in these tendencies,"" added Mariana. On his first day in office, Lula signed a series of decrees to annul measures harmful to the environment, create a working group to combat deforestation, and reactivate the Amazon Fund, an initiative financed with foreign donations that had been suspended since 2019. Lula also tried to convince the richest countries on the planet to fund initiatives to protect the forest, adding to Norway and Germany's contributions to the Fund, something that has so far yielded little fruit.

The area, almost four times the size of Manhattan Island, increased by 150% from the 87.2 km² deforested in December 2021, according to Inpe. Bolsonaro generated international protests during his four years in office due to a wave of fires and deforestation in the Amazon. Under his government, an agribusiness ally and climate change denier, average annual deforestation in the Amazon increased 75.5 percent over the previous decade. ""The Bolsonaro government is over, but its harmful environmental legacy will still be felt for quite some time,"" pointed out Marcio Astrini, executive secretary of the coalition of environmental groups Climate Observatory. Last December was the third worst month recorded by the Deter program in its eight years of existence, after those of 2017 and 2015. Deforestation in 2022 was also near or at record levels during the dry season months (August, September, and October), when logging and fires usually increase. According to experts, the destruction is mainly due to ranches and landowners who clear the forest for cattle ranching and plantations. In his two previous terms (2003-2010), president Lula achieved a sharp drop in deforestation. He has promised to resume environmental protection programs, to strive for zero deforestation, and to ensure that the country ceases to be a ""pariah"" in climate issues."

2023-01-08,Deforestation in the Amazon is influencing climate in Tibet,115," Like the Amazon, the Tibetan Plateau could also be approaching a tipping point.Photo: AFP - AFP AgencyDeforestation in the Amazon, a phenomenon that has worried activists and governments in the region, is apparently also having an effect on the climate in regions such as Tibet, more than 15,000 kilometers from the jungle. In a study published in the journal Nature Climate Change, researchers described how the Amazon Rainforest Area (ARA) has ""strong correlations"" with the Tibetan Plateau (TP) and the West Antarctic ice sheet. The models they used to identify the impacts that the transformation of the Amazon is having on other parts of the world allowed them to find associations between rainforest deforestation and rising temperatures in Tibet. ""We found that several climate extremes between the ARA and TP are synchronized under climate change,"" the authors of the new study stated. ( AlsoResearchers analyzed global climate data between 1979, as well as teleconnections between the two regions. ""Teleconnections describe remote connections between components of the complex climate system and reflect the transport of energy or materials on a global scale,"" the study indicates. In that sense, the researchers found a possible propagation path of this teleconnection, which can be divided into three parts: from central South America to southern Africa; from southern Africa to the Middle East; and the last one from the Middle East to the Tibetan Plateau. The length of the route is approximately 20,000 kilometers. Among other findings, they identified that the deforestation phenomenon correlates with rising temperatures in Tibet and the West Antarctic ice sheet. In addition, they found that when it rained more in the Amazon, there tended to be less precipitation in the other two regions. The study also highlights that the extent of the TP snow cover has been losing stability since 2008 and that this may be one of the indicators that this region is increasingly closer to reaching a tipping point. (You may be interested in: Deforestation of the Brazilian Amazon increased 150% in Bolsonaro's last month) This refers to a moment where all changes in an ecosystem (such as deforestation in the Amazon) affect it, changing its characteristics forever, with no possibility of returning it to its initial state. This concept is also known as the ""point of no return"" and has been extensively studied in the case of the Amazon rainforest. The latest Amazonia Viva report warned that ""the processes of deforestation, as well as the degradation of its forests and rivers, are taking the Amazon to a point of no return"". Currently, of the 7 million square kilometers that comprise the Amazon, 18% of the forests have been lost and an additional 17% are degraded. In Brazil alone, which is home to 60 % of the rainforest, more than 1,600,000 hectares were deforested in 2021, 59 % of which corresponded to the Amazon. The researchers warned, then, that it is possible that if this region reaches a tipping point, it could also trigger a tipping point in Tibet . ???? ????

2023-03-08,Deforestation in the Amazon sets a historical record in February,116,"Deforestation in the Amazon set an all-time record in February, according to data from the National Institute for Space Research (Inpe). The number was the highest since the beginning of the historical series in 2015. According to Inpe, between the 1st and 24th of last month, 290.75 km² of Legal Amazon forest were deforested, which is equivalent to the size of the capital city of João Pessoa (Paraíba). The number is 46% higher than in February 2022, when 146.32 km² were deforested. The state that registered the most deforestation was Mato Grosso with around 145 km², followed by Pará (45 km²), Amazonas (42 km²), Roraima (31 km²) and Rondônia (24 km²). The record deforestation was pointed out after a 61% reduction in deforestation rates in January 2023, compared to the same month in 2022. At the end of February, in a meeting at Itamaraty, the Minister of the Environment and Climate Change, Marina Silva, attributed the expansion of deforestation in the Amazon to ""a revenge against measures adopted by the government to combat illicit activities in the region"". She said that ""criminal action has been identified even during the rainy season"" and said that the government will relaunch the plan to combat devastation in the Amazon forest in April."
2023-03-10,Deforestation in the Amazon sets a record and reaches 321.97 km² in February,117,"The National Institute for Space Research (INPE) updated on Friday (10) the data of deforestation alerts in the Legal Amazon in February, confirming the perspective of a record for the month since the beginning of the historical series. The number went from 290.75 km² between the 1st and 24th of last month to 321.97 km² in the month's consolidated data. The area with deforestation alerts grew 62.06% in February, compared to the same month last year, when 198.67 km² were recorded. In the year-to-date, the Legal Amazon accumulates an area of 489 km², ""second largest area deforested in these two months since 2016, the beginning of the historical series - the record occurred in the same period last year (629 km²),"" says the Ministry of Environment. The states that registered the most deforestation alerts in February were Mato Grosso (168.83 km²), Pará (46.46 km²) and Amazonas (46.37 km²). Earlier this week, the ministry decreed an environmental emergency situation for forest fire risk for several regions of the country between April 2023 and February 2024. In mid-February, when the first data for the month came out, the vice-president Geraldo Alckmin (PSB) stated that it was necessary to analyze what had happened for this jump in the number of alerts. The President of the Republic has not yet made any statement about Inpe's update."
2023-02-10,Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon drops 61% in Lula's first month in office,118,"Sao Paulo, Feb. 10. Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon fell by 61.3% in January, the first month of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva's government, compared to the same period in 2022, according to data released Friday. In total, 166.58 square kilometers of forest were destroyed in the month, according to satellite data from the Deter system of the Brazilian Institute for Space Research (INPE). These data are partial, since they do not capture deforestation in areas covered by clouds, and in January 2023, 50.27% of the Brazilian Amazon territory could not be observed for this reason, while in January 2022 this area was 48.04%. The figure was worse than that recorded in January 2021 (82.8 square kilometers) or 2019 (136.1 square kilometers), during the administration of Jair Bolsonaro, who relaxed the fight against deforestation, allowed logging and mining in protected areas and promoted controversial development projects in the region. In a statement, the non-governmental organization WWF positively valued the deforestation data for January 2023, although it said that ""it is still early"" to talk about a reversal of the trend of forest destruction. In 2022, the last year of Bolsonaro's government, the Brazilian Amazon lost 10,267 square kilometers of vegetation cover, a record level since satellite measurements have been taken. President Lula has made the fight against deforestation one of his priorities, with the goal of reducing it to zero by 2030. In his first month in office, Lula reactivated the Amazon Fund, financed by Norway and Germany, revoked Bolsonaro's controversial measures and set up a group with 17 ministries to define policies for the preservation of the rainforest. In Brazil, deforestation is the main cause of the emission of polluting gases into the atmosphere."
2023-02-10,Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon falls 61% in first month of Lula's government,119,"Monitoring of the Amazon detected 167 km2 of forest destroyed last month in the Brazilian part of the world's largest rainforest, a figure lower than that measured in January 2022, according to preliminary data from the Deter satellite monitoring system of the National Institute for Space Research (INPE). Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon fell 61% in January, the first month of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva's administration, compared to the same period in 2022, according to an official report released Friday. Satellite monitoring detected 167 km2 of forest destroyed last month in the Brazilian part of the world's largest rainforest, according to preliminary data from the Deter satellite monitoring system of the National Institute for Space Research (INPE). The area, equivalent to more than 22,000 soccer fields, represents a drop from 430 km2 in January 2022, still under the administration of former ultra-right-wing president Jair Bolsonaro, according to INPE. Under Bolsonaro's administration, an ally of agribusiness and climate change denier, average annual deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon increased 75.5% over the previous decade. The decrease in the area destroyed could reflect a ""resumption of the environmental defense agenda,"" said the environmental NGO WWF-Brazil in a note, although ""it is premature to speak of a trend reversal."" ""It is necessary to restructure with the utmost urgency the Action Plans for the Prevention and Control of Deforestation and Deforestation and Burning for Brazil to resume its role of environmental leadership on the international scene,"" said Frederico Machado, a WWF-Brazil conservation specialist, who described the recent policy as ""anti-environmental"" and ""criminal"". Experts assure that the destruction is mainly due to the advance of farms and land usurpers who cut down the rainforest for cattle ranching and crops. The 77-year-old leftist president, who governed the country between 2003 and 2010, promised to restart environmental protection programs, to fight to meet the goal of zero illegal deforestation by 2030 and to ensure that Brazil ceases to be a ""pariah"" in climate issues. Lula appointed Marina Silva, a renowned environmentalist who headed the Ministry of Environment between 2003 and 2008, when Brazil managed to significantly reduce deforestation. Near the end of her first month in office, on January 24, Silva acknowledged in an interview with AFP that Brazil's environmental reality is ""much worse"" than expected. Brazil is in talks with some Western powers, such as France, to contribute resources and add their efforts to the Amazon Fund, whose main donors are Norway and Germany. In addition to the fight against deforestation, Lula's government is combating other crimes, such as illegal mining, with an operation to expel land invaders from the Yanomami ethnic group in the country's largest indigenous reserve on the border with Venezuela."
2023-02-24,Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon has already broken records for February,120,"Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon set a record for February, the second month of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva's administration, according to official data available on Friday, which contemplates a little more than half of the period, still unfinished. Satellite monitoring detected 209 km2 of destroyed forest in the Brazilian part of the world's largest rainforest, according to preliminary data from the DETER monitoring system of the National Institute for Space Research (INPE). The area, equivalent to more than 29,000 soccer fields, only contemplates data up to February 17, but already represents an increase in relation to the previous record of 199 km2 destroyed in the entire month of February 2022, the last year of the government of the former ultra-right-wing president Jair Bolsonaro. Last January, satellite monitoring had reported a drop of 61% in relation to the same period of 2022, although environmental organizations had warned that it was premature to speak of a ""trend reversal"", since part of the drop could be related to a greater cloud cover that impaired the calculations. ""The increase in deforestation may be a reflection of the limitation in detection last month due to cloud cover, and what is being observed now perhaps contemplates both the area destroyed this month and also from January,"" Daniel Silva, a conservation specialist with the NGO WWF-Brazil, told AFP. Under the Bolsonaro administration, an ally of agribusiness and climate change denier, average annual deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon increased 75.5% over the previous decade. Experts assure that the destruction is mainly due to the advance of farms and land usurpers who clear the jungle for livestock and crops. Lula, 77 years old, assumed the presidency of Brazil for the third time with the protection of the forest as one of his main banners to enable Brazil to stop being a ""pariah"" in climate issues. The leftist president appointed Marina Silva, a renowned environmentalist who headed the Ministry of the Environment between 2003 and 2008, when Brazil managed to significantly reduce deforestation. On January 24, Silva acknowledged in an interview with AFP that Brazil's environmental reality is ""much worse"" than expected. ""We know that there is an effort by the new government to control deforestation, but concrete results will take time to be seen,"" added the WWF-Brazil expert."
2023-01-06,Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon increased 150% in one year,121,"Under the administration of the ultra-right-wing former president, Jair Bolsonaro, the Amazon in Brazil is disappearing faster and faster due to deforestation. A report by the National Institute for Space Research (INPE) revealed that, compared to December 2021, deforestation in a piece of land in the Amazon increased by 150%. Satellite monitoring detected 218.4 square kilometers of forest cover destroyed last month in Brazil's part of the world's largest rainforest, in relation to the 87.2 square kilometers deforested in December 2021. Jair Bolsonaro: the legal proceedings he may face now that he is no longer president of Brazil Under Bolsonaro, an agribusiness ally and climate change denier, the average annual deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon increased 75.5% over the previous decade. Deforestation in 2022 was also at record levels during the dry season months (August, September and October), when logging and fires often increase due to drier weather. These fires provoked a wave of criticism against the former president, who was replaced on January 1 by Lula da Silva, the leftist president who promised to fight deforestation when he takes office. ""There will be no climate security if the Amazon is not protected"", said Lula, who added that all crimes committed against the rainforest in his country, from illegal logging to mining, will be fought ""relentlessly"" at the UN Climate Summit COP27."
NA,NA,122,"End of Document SAO PAULO, Mar 10 (Reuters) - Deforestation in Brazil's Amazon rainforest rose in February to the highest level on record for the month, preliminary official data showed on Friday, highlighting the challenges facing the new government to halt the destruction. President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva took office on Jan. 1 and pledged to end illegal logging after years of rising deforestation under his predecessor, Jair Bolsonaro. Environmental experts and officials have warned that it could take years to significantly reduce deforestation after Bolsonaro cut funds and staff at key agencies. ""We have just left behind a government that supported deforestation,"" Greenpeace Brazil spokesman Romulo Batista said Friday. ""As long as enforcement and control doesn't reach the whole region, illegal deforesters can exploit that to increase this deforestation."" Data from space research agency Inpe showed 322 square kilometers were cleared in the region last month, 62% more than in February 2022 and well above the average of 166 square kilometers for the period. It was also the highest since the Inpe data series began in 2015. But thanks to lower-than-average figures in January, deforestation fell 22% in the first two months of 2023 compared to the same period last year, according to Inpe. In a presentation last week, an Inpe scientist blamed the large month-to-month fluctuations on cloud cover that hid deforestation in satellite images in January, only for it to be revealed in February. Environment Minister Marina Silva said last month, based on partial data from February, that it was unusual to have high deforestation so early in the year, when heavy rains make it difficult for loggers to work in the forest. ""They are deforesting even in the rainy season. It is a kind of revenge against the actions that are already being taken, but we will continue working to achieve our goal,"" Silva told reporters. Load-Date: March 11, 2023"
2023-04-07,Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon increases in the first three months of 2023,123,"Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon increased again in March, closing the first 100 days of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva's government with one of the worst rates on record, in a rise that environmental organizations blame on the environmental deregulation that took place during the four years of Jair Bolsonaro's government. Between January and March of this year, the destruction of the Brazilian Amazon was the second highest in the historical series for that period, with 844 square kilometers destroyed, only below the figure for 2022, when 941 square kilometers were destroyed, according to official figures released Friday by the National Institute for Space Research (INPE). After four years of the pro-Bolsonar government, which, according to experts, has weakened regulations and environmental protection agencies, the improvement in deforestation rates could be delayed, according to the NGO Wildlife Brazil (WWF). ""The data show that there is a complex scenario in the face of the weakening of control in the region and the pro-illegality discourse of recent years,"" explained Mariana Napolitano, conservation manager of the NGO. Reversing deforestation policies Since his election, Lula promised to reverse the environmental policies of his predecessor and eradicate illegal deforestation. ""Although the current government has demonstrated its intention to combat deforestation very seriously, it will take time to change the scenario,"" added the WWF-Brazil expert. On his first day in office, Lula signed a series of decrees to annul measures harmful to the environment, create a task force to combat deforestation and reactivate the Amazon Fund, an initiative financed by foreign donations that had been suspended since 2019. Before taking office, he traveled to the climate summit in Egypt, where he was a special guest, and pledged to fight ""very hard"" against deforestation, while proposing to host the 2025 climate conference."
2023-01-07,Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon reached a record level in Bolsonaro's last year in office,124,"During the government of Jair Bolsonaro, the Brazilian Amazon reached a deforestation record. During his last year in the Planalto Palace alone, 10,267 kilometers of vegetation cover were lost, equivalent to a country like Lebanon. This figure, in turn, shows an increase of 24.9% over the area of forest damaged the previous year, when it was 8,219 square kilometers. Thus, 2022 recorded the highest number since the National Institute of Special Studies (INPE) began measuring so-called deforestation alerts in 2015. Prior to the latest report released, the year with the highest deforestation recorded was 2019, when Bolsonaro became President of Brazil, and 9,178 square kilometers were lost. For these estimates, the agency uses satellite images disseminated by Deter, a mechanism that alerts monthly and in real time about threatened areas in the Amazon. However, its data are less precise than those of Prodes, another tool used by INPE to calculate deforestation each year. Prodes released its latest bulletin in November and reported that, between August 2021 and July 2022, the Amazon lost 11,568 kilometers of vegetation, an extension 11.3% less than that recorded in the same period of the previous year - when it was 13,038 square kilometers. This was, however, the highest in the last 14 years. At the same time, this report informed that only between August and December 2022, 4,793 kilometers of forest were logged there, a record value for the period. In addition, in December alone, deforestation extended over 218.4 square kilometers, which represents a 150% jump compared to the same month in 2021 -when it was only 87 square kilometers-. Again the highest number for this month since the beginning of the previous government. These figures are not surprising since, from the very beginning, Bolsonaro stated that the conservation of the rainforest was not one of his priorities; on the contrary, he decimated the offices in charge of its preservation and defended mining even in the reserves. This caused multiple criticisms from environmental groups, who hold him responsible for the current crisis in the Amazon. These organizations had already warned that in the last months of 2022, the pace of destruction there was accelerating due to the expectation of the president that he would be defeated in the October elections. In view of this delicate context and in order to fulfill one of his main campaign promises, the new president of Brazil, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, assured that one of the priorities of his administration will be to reduce deforestation in the Amazon to a minimum. He also added that he will relentlessly combat illegal logging and mining, which are also major causes of environmental disasters. In this sense, his Minister of the Environment, the environmentalist Marina Silva, moved forward with the creation of a secretariat dedicated exclusively to combating deforestation. On the other hand, the executive secretary of the Climate Observatory, Marcio Astrini, warned that ""the destruction alerts were record in the last months of 2022, which left the Lula government a rate that will negatively affect the numbers of 2023″. And he concluded that ""Bolsonaro's government may be over but his nefarious environmental legacy will be felt for a long time"".

2023-02-24,Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon sets a record for the month of February,125,"Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon set a record for the month of February, the second month of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva's administration, according to official data released on Friday (24), which cover a little more than half of the period, still incomplete. Satellite monitoring has detected 209 km2 of deforestation in the Brazilian part of the world's largest tropical forest, according to preliminary data from the DETER surveillance system of the National Institute for Space Research (INPE). Equivalent to more than 29,000 soccer fields, the area only includes data through February 17, but already represents an increase over the previous record of 199 km2 destroyed over the month of February 2022, the last year of Jair Bolsonaro's government. Last January, satellite monitoring showed a 61% drop from the same period in 2022, although environmental organizations had warned that it was premature to talk about a reversal of the trend, since part of the drop could be related to greater cloud cover that affected calculations. ""The increase in Amazon deforestation in DETER may be a reflection of the limitation in detection last month due to high cloud cover. The deforestation we are observing may then not only contemplate this month's deforestation but also last month's deforestation,"" Daniel Silva, a conservation specialist with the NGO WWF-Brazil, told AFP. Under the Bolsonaro administration, an agribusiness ally and climate change denier, average annual deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon has increased 75.5 percent over the previous decade. Experts say that the destruction is mainly due to the advance of landowners who clear the forest to develop agricultural and cattle ranching activities. Lula, 77 years old, assumed the presidency for the third time with the protection of the forest as one of his main demands so that Brazil stops being a ""pariah"" in climate issues. The leftist president once again nominated renowned environmentalist Marina Silva as environment minister, who headed the portfolio between 2003 and 2008, when Brazil managed to significantly reduce deforestation. On January 24, Silva acknowledged in an interview with AFP that Brazil's environmental reality is ""much worse"" than expected. ""We know that there is a commitment by the new government to control deforestation, but concrete results should take some time to be observed,"" added the WWF-Brazil expert."
2023-03-10,Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon sets historical record in February,126,"Rio de Janeiro, Mar. 10. Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon soared in February by 61.8% compared to the same period in 2022 and even before the end of the month it was already the highest for the period since the measurement began, the government reported Friday. According to data from the deforestation alert system of the National Institute for Space Research (Inpe), 322 square kilometers of native vegetation were devastated last month. In addition to significantly surpassing the 199 square kilometers destroyed in the same month of 2022, this is the highest devastation recorded for a month of February since 2015, when the Government began measuring with the Real-Time Legal Amazon Deforestation Detection System (Deter). The area destroyed in the biome last month was also 93.3% higher than in January, when it lost 166.58 square kilometers. In the first month of the year, deforestation of the largest tropical rainforest on the planet recorded a sharp drop (-61.3%) in the year-on-year comparison and decreased by 27% compared to December. That month, however, experts emphasized that the data were partial, since the dense cloud cover over the biome in January prevented satellites from capturing devastated areas in more than half of the Brazilian Amazon. Thus, it is quite possible that in February the Deter will have recorded the devastation that it failed to capture in January. In 2022, the Brazilian Amazon lost 10,278 square kilometers of vegetation cover, a level never seen before since Deter has been used in Brazil. The deforestation of the biome increased by almost 60% in the four years of Jair Bolsonaro's government (2019-2022) compared to the previous four-year term due to the lack of controls and the weakening of environmental bodies, since the ultra-right-wing leader defends the exploitation of natural resources in the forest, even in indigenous reserves, where it is prohibited by law. The recovery of the Brazilian Amazon is one of the main commitments announced by Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva since he was elected president of the South American giant, a promise he reiterated when he assumed his third mandate on January 1. In his first month in office, Lula reactivated the Amazon Fund, financed by Norway and Germany and in which he also announced that the United States will participate; he revoked controversial measures of Bolsonaro and set up a group with 17 ministries to define policies for the preservation of the rainforest. He also faced a strong fight against the illegal extraction of precious metals in the biome after the health crisis discovered in the Yanomami reserve, caused by the invasion of some 20,000 miners who are still being expelled from the indigenous territory by the authorities. ""We have just come out of a government that supported deforestation. Until oversight and control do not reach the entire territory, illegal deforesters will continue to take advantage to act,"" said Romulo Batista, spokesman for the Amazon for Greenpeace Brazil, attributing the increase in devastation in the first two months to the effects of Bolsonaro's policies.

2023-01-04,Deforestation is wiping out an area larger than the size of Portugal every year,127,"Every year some 10 million hectares of forests are destroyed, an area larger than the size of Portugal and equivalent to that of Iceland, according to the UN, which points to this ""alarming"" global deforestation, along with agriculture and other changes in land use, as responsible for 25% of global emissions of greenhouse gases. According to the latest report from the UN-REDD Programme, the United Nations Environment Programme's World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC) and the Green Gigaton Challenge (GGC) initiative, the world is not on track to achieve the forest goals of ending and reversing deforestation by 2030, a key aspiration for progress towards the Paris Agreement's 1.5°C target. The report concludes that, for the 2030 targets to be achievable, the milestone of one gigatonne equivalent in emissions reversed by forests must be reached by 2025 at the latest. Precisely climate defense in general and reversing deforestation of the Amazon in particular was one of the banners of the campaign that brought to power the new president of Brazil, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who plans to convene a summit this year with the presidents of the eleven countries that share the planet's largest plant lung. His commitment is to reestablish measures to combat deforestation in the Amazon abandoned by his predecessor in office, Jair Bolsonaro, during whose term in office forest destruction increased by almost 60%, with an average area devastated of 11,396 square kilometers per year. Among the causes of deforestation are forest fires, which, in addition to destroying forests and biodiversity, release large amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere. By way of example, in 2022 some 786,000 hectares of forest were burned in the EU, 39% of them in Spain, and 28 million tons of CO2 were released into the atmosphere. Figures similar to those in other parts of the planet in a particularly virulent year: the outbreaks of fires at the beginning of 2022 in the Argentine province of Corrientes, in the northeast, devastated 785,000 hectares, and in Bolivia 854,724 hectares burned only until September. Against this backdrop, the UN believes that limiting the average global temperature increase to 1.5°C will be impossible unless forests play a major role, both in terms of the massive emissions reductions that can be achieved by halting deforestation and the additional carbon that can be sequestered through improved forest management and reforestation. Their calculations indicate that eliminating emissions from deforestation and increasing carbon removals by promoting forest regeneration and landscape restoration could reduce global net emissions by up to 30% and, over the next decade, forests could provide up to 50% of the cost-effective mitigation available. That target is a long way off, however, considering that between about 10 million hectares of forests are destroyed each year, deforestation that is responsible for about 25% of global greenhouse gas emissions along with agriculture and other land-use changes. ""Deforestation and land degradation also undermine efforts to build resilience to climate impacts and threaten forest-dwelling communities,"" the UN laments. Some 70% of tropical forest destruction is generated by the production of agricultural commodities, including palm oil, beef, soybeans, timber, and pulp and paper, says the UN, which says that halting this trend requires decoupling commodity production from deforestation.

2023-01-06,Deforestation of the Brazilian Amazon set a record in Bolsonaro's last year,128,"The area of forest in the Brazilian Amazon devastated last year was 24.9% higher than that destroyed in 2021 (8,219 square kilometers) and the largest since the National Institute of Spatial Studies (INPE) began measuring in 2015 the so-called deforestation alerts, the official agency reported Friday. Until now, the year with the highest deforestation was 2019 (9,178 square kilometers), precisely the first year in office of the far-right leader, whom environmentalists accuse of the current crisis in the Amazon for his anti-environmentalist rhetoric, his defense of mining, and for dismantling oversight agencies. The data released on Friday are measured by Deter, a mechanism that uses satellite images to provide monthly and real-time alerts on threatened areas in the Amazon, but are less precise than those of Prodes, a tool used by INPE to calculate deforestation, which is released annually. According to the latest Prodes bulletin, released in November, the Amazon lost 11,568 kilometers of vegetation between August 2021 and July 2022, an area 11.3% smaller than the previous year (13,038 square kilometers), but the second highest in the last 14 years. Environmental organizations had already warned that the destruction would grow at a record pace in the last months of 2022 in the expectation that Bolsonaro would be defeated in the October presidential elections, which ended up happening. Brazil's new president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who took office on January 1, promised that one of his government's priorities will be to return to minimizing deforestation in the Amazon, as he did in his first administration (2003-2010), and to relentlessly combat illegal logging and mining. His Minister of the Environment, the environmentalist Marina Silva, announced this week the creation of a secretariat within her portfolio dedicated exclusively to combating deforestation. According to INPE data, between August and December 2022 alone, 4,793 kilometers of rainforest were cleared in the Amazon, a record amount for the period. In December alone, deforestation extended over 218.4 square kilometers, with a jump of 150% compared to the same month of 2021 (87 square kilometers) and the highest number for this month since the beginning of the previous Government. ""Destruction alerts were record in the last months of 2022, which left the Lula Government a rate that will negatively affect the numbers for 2023,"" since the annual measurement is between August of one year and July of the next, said the executive secretary of the Climate Observatory, Marcio Astrini. For the leader of the main network of environmental groups in Brazil, ""Bolsonaro's government is over, but his disastrous environmental legacy will still be felt for a long time"". "
2023-01-06,Deforestation of the Brazilian Amazon was record in Bolsonaro's last year,129,"Environmental organizations had already warned that the destruction was growing at a record pace in the last months of 2022. RIO DE JANEIRO. The Brazilian Amazon lost 10,267 kilometers of vegetation cover in 2022, an extension equivalent to that of a country like Lebanon, bringing the deforestation of the world's largest rainforest to a record level in the last year of President Jair Bolsonaro's government. The area of rainforest in the Brazilian Amazon devastated last year was 24.9% higher than that destroyed in 2021 (8,219 square kilometers) and the largest since the National Institute for Space Studies (INPE) began measuring so-called deforestation alerts in 2015, the official agency reported this January 6, 2023. Until now, the year with the highest deforestation was 2019 (9,178 square kilometers), precisely the first of management of the ultra-right leader, whom environmentalists accuse of the current crisis in the Amazon for his anti-environmentalist rhetoric, his defense of mining even in reserves, and for dismantling the oversight agencies. The data released on January 6 are measured by Deter, a mechanism that uses satellite images to alert monthly and in real time about threatened areas in the Amazon, but are less precise than those of Prodes, a tool used by INPE to calculate deforestation, which is released annually. According to the latest Prodes bulletin, released in November, the Amazon lost 11,568 kilometers of vegetation between August 2021 and July 2022, an area 11.3% smaller than the previous year (13,038 square kilometers) but the second highest in the last 14 years.

2023-03-21,Emerging Deforestation Frontier In Southwestern Amazon Sees Increase In Burnings,130,"A swathe of the Amazon Rainforest almost twice the size of Luxembourg was destroyed by fire between 2003 and 2019. The area is in the southwest of Amazonas state, in Brazil's North region, and includes parts of nine municipalities with some of the worst sustainable development indicators in the country. Deforestation had been increasing in the area, largely owing to illegal logging and other activities linked to agriculture along two highways that run through it. In the period 2003-19, fire destroyed 4,141 square kilometers (km²) of forest, of which 3,999 km² was primary (native) vegetation. A year-by-year breakdown shows that the area affected by fire ranged from a low of 33 km² in 2011 to a high of 681 km² in 2019. In addition, 6,484 km² of pasture and crops burned down in the period. These numbers are from an article published in the journal Fire reporting a study by scientists at the National Disaster Surveillance and Early Warning Center (CEMADEN) and the National Space Research Institute (INPE), both of which are Brazilian institutions, in partnership with colleagues at universities and other research institutions in Brazil and abroad. According to the article, which focuses on Boca do Acre, a municipality in Amazonas state, loss of vegetation due to deforestation increased the occurrence of burned areas, resulting in transformation of the landscape from forest to cropland and pastureland, especially in the vicinity of highways BR-317 and BR-364. Factors such as intensification of the dry season and more frequent extreme weather events also made the region susceptible to anthropogenic (human-induced) fire. Moreover, the accumulation of organic matter from deforested areas fueled ongoing fires, which spread as a result. On the other hand, protected areas such as conservation units and Indigenous territories acted as a barrier against deforestation. Fire destroyed only 189.13 km², or 1.3% of the total, in the period 2003-19, mainly near roads and farms in the Boca do Acre and Apurinã Indigenous Territories. ""Our study identified the extent and frequency of fires, and the correlations with changes in land cover and climate, pointing to priority areas for conservation. We also analyzed the susceptibility to fire of forest on undesignated public land and adjacent to rural properties. This is troubling. More recent deforestation is increasingly close to protected areas, which thereby become even more vulnerable,"" said Débora Dutra, first author of the article. She is an environmental and sanitary engineer and a researcher at CEMADEN, with a scholarship from FAPESP. Undesignated land is government land that has not been assigned to a specific use, such conservation or settlement. This category is the most vulnerable to encroachment by land grabbers and squatters. For Liana Anderson, also a researcher at CEMADEN and supervisor of Dutra's master's research, in addition to its detailed analysis of fire patterns in the area, the study also evidenced how fire is advancing through the Amazon Rainforest. ""The region is known as the new deforestation frontier,"" she said. ""A first wave devoured the forest from Mato Grosso [a state in Brazil's Center-West region], and the fires then moved on up into Amazonas state. This area is under pressure, but conservation units and Indigenous territories have served as barriers, emphasizing their importance to maintenance of the forest and its socio-biodiversity."""
2023-01-01,Environment: transition to a low-carbon economy is a priority,131,"The resumption of the leading role in the international agenda on climate, forests, biodiversity, indigenous peoples and traditional populations, water, Amazon, ocean, clean energy and decarbonization of production chains is among the priorities in relation to the environmental area of the government of President-elect Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who takes office next Sunday (1). The information is part of the transition cabinet's final report released after the closing of the activities developed by the thematic groups. The Ministry of Environment will be headed by Marina Silva.   Former senator, Marina Silva becomes Environment Minister again - Reproduction/YouTube The new government has among its goals the transition to a low-carbon economy, still unregulated in the country. The strategy is aimed at containing greenhouse gas emissions and has been gaining more and more space around the world .  Related News: New government will have as a challenge to recompose education budget. Vaccination coverage and reduction of health queues are challenges of the government. ""The transition to a low carbon economy is understood as a competitive advantage for the country, which is able to generate business, products and services with lower carbon emissions, besides offering solutions for the needs of mitigation and adaptation to climate change. Our challenge is to rebuild the dismantling of institutions and to reconnect the country with its future as an environmental power"", points out the document. According to the survey, Jair Bolsonaro's government ""has promoted a deliberate and illegal dismantling of public policies, regulatory frameworks, spaces for control and social participation, and public agencies and institutions linked to the preservation of forests, biodiversity, genetic heritage, and the climate and environmental agenda. To reverse this scenario, the transition team proposes the repeal of several ""extremely serious"" normative acts that have already been the object of lawsuits in the Federal Supreme Court (STF).  Logs of wood in a sawmill yard near the municipality of Colniza, northwest Mato Grosso - Marcelo Camargo/Archive Agência Brasil ""  The Green Package, analyzed by the STF, is made up of seven lawsuits in which acts of the Bolsonaro government are analyzed that led to to the destructuring of Brazilian environmental legislation, to the weakening of the inspection and combat of environmental crimes and crimes related to indigenous peoples, to the unprotection of the environment as a whole and especially the Amazon biome,"" says the report. The suggested repeals have, among their objectives, that of controlling deforestation, resuming the Action Plan for Prevention and Control of Deforestation in the Legal Amazon (PPCDAM) which, according to the transition group, is one of the ""main instruments capable of controlling deforestation, contributing to the reduction of gas emissions. The report also proposes an end to impunity by revoking ""decrees that annulled environmental fines, paralyzed the environmental inspection system, and created an environment of persecution of inspectors. The estimated loss with the annulment of these fines is over R$ 18 billion in resources for the public coffers, according to surveys presented in the report. Still within the scope of environmental protection, proposals were presented for the total revocation of the decree that allows illegal mining in the Amazon (10.966/2022); the resumption of the Amazon Fund; and the structuring of the National Environmental Council (Conama). Deforestation Degraded area in the municipality of Colniza, northwest Mato Grosso - Marcelo Camargo/Archive Agência Brasil According to the survey, the deforestation rates in the Amazon and Cerrado reached peaks never seen 15 years ago. ""There was a 60% increase in deforestation in the Amazon during the Bolsonaro administration, the highest percentage increase that has ever occurred in a presidential term, since satellite measurements began in 1988,"" the report says. Another point highlighted in the document in relation to the environment concerns the impact caused by the imposition of barriers to Brazilian products in international trade, the restriction of access to credit, the loss of credibility of Brazil before the rest of the world, in addition to the compromise of national sovereignty in relation to the Amazon.  Children play in the São Lourenço riverside community - Marcelo Camargo/Archive Agência Brasil ""  Traditional communities and peoples have been persecuted or forgotten, in total ignorance of their importance for the protection of Brazilian biodiversity and the attraction of international funding and donations focused on environmental and social sustainability,"" adds the document . Staff The survey prepared by the transition team also warns about the reduction and equipping of the staff of the Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (Ibama), Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation (ICMBio), Brazilian Forest System (SFB) and the Ministry of Environment (MMA) itself. Currently, these agencies have 2,103 vacant positions. ""While Ibama had 1,800 public servants working in environmental inspection in 2008, now there are only about 700, not all of them in the field. There has been effective staffing and occupation of managerial and directorial positions without the technical and political capacity to act in the area of environmental protection and management. There are many cases of persecution and harassment of the agencies' employees,"" says the report.

2023-01-07,Every year 10 million hectares of forest are destroyed worldwide,132," In 2022, some 786,000 hectares of forest were burned in the EU and 28 million tons of CO? were released into the atmosphere. Photo: (EPA) EFE - Raphael AlvesEvery year some 10 million hectares of forests are destroyed, an area larger than the size of Portugal and equivalent to that of Iceland, according to the UN, which points to this ""alarming"" global deforestation, along with agriculture and other land use changes, as responsible for 25% of global greenhouse gas emissions. (See: Infographic: How has biodiversity changed over time?) According to the latest report from the UN-REDD Programme, the United Nations Environment Programme World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC) and the Green Gigaton Challenge (GGC) initiative, the world is not on track to achieve the forest goals of ending and reversing deforestation by 2030, a key aspiration for progress towards the Paris Agreement target of 1.5° Celsius . The report concludes that, for the 2030 targets to be achievable, the milestone of one gigatonne equivalent in emissions reversed by forests must be reached by 2025 at the latest. Deforestation of the AmazonPrecisely climate defense in general and reversing the deforestation of the Amazon in particular was one of the banners of the campaign that brought to power the new president of Brazil, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who plans to convene a summit this year with the presidents of the eleven countries that share the planet's largest plant lung . His commitment is to reestablish measures to combat deforestation in the Amazon abandoned by his predecessor in office, Jair Bolsonaro, during whose mandate forest destruction increased by almost 60%, with an average area devastated of 11,396 square kilometers per year. (Read: Marina Silva, defender of the Brazilian Amazon who repeats as Minister of the Environment) Forest firesForest fires are among the causes of deforestation, which, in addition to destroying forests and biodiversity, release large quantities of CO? into the atmosphere . By way of example, in 2022 some 786,000 hectares of forest were burned in the EU, 39% of them in Spain, and 28 million tons of CO? were released into the atmosphere. Figures similar to those in other parts of the world in a particularly virulent year: the outbreaks of fires at the beginning of 2022 in the northeastern Argentine province of Corrientes devastated 785,000 hectares, and in Bolivia 854,724 hectares burned up to September alone. Global greenhouse gas emissionsWith this scenario, the UN believes that limiting the average global temperature increase to 1.5°C will be impossible without forests playing a major role, both in terms of the massive emissions reductions that can be achieved by halting deforestation and the additional carbon that can be sequestered through improved forest management and reforestation . Their calculations indicate that eliminating emissions from deforestation and increasing carbon removals by promoting forest regeneration and landscape restoration could reduce global net emissions by up to 30% and, over the next decade, forests could provide up to 50% of the cost-effective mitigation available. That target is a long way off, however, considering that between about 10 million hectares of forests are destroyed each year, deforestation that is responsible for about 25% of global greenhouse gas emissions, along with agriculture and other land-use changes. ""Deforestation and land degradation also undermine efforts to build resilience to climate impacts and threaten forest-dwelling communities,"" the UN laments.

2023-01-19,Exclusive-First Brazil Logging Raids Under Lula Aim To Curb Amazon Deforestation,133,"Jan 19, 2023( International Business Times News: https://www.ibtimes.com/ Delivered by Newstex)   Brazil's first raids against illegal deforestation in the Amazon rainforest under President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva were underway on Thursday, after the new leader's pledge to end destruction that surged under his predecessor Jair Bolsonaro.  Reuters exclusively accompanied raids led by environmental agency Ibama in the rainforest state of Para to stop loggers and ranchers illegally clearing the forest. The agency has also launched raids this week in the states of Roraima and Acre, Ibama environmental enforcement coordinator Tatiane Leite said.  About 10 Ibama agents set out in pickup trucks on Thursday from their base in the municipality of Uruara, Para, along with a dozen federal police, heading toward an indigenous reserve where satellite images showed loggers and ranchers recently at work clearing the forest illegally. The mission aims to stop or scare off loggers to avoid further incursions into the forest and to issue fines to those caught with illegal wood.  The Bolsonaro government had gutted staff and funding for environmental enforcement by Ibama in his four years in office, while the former president criticized the agency for issuing fines to farmers and miners.  Bolsonaro gave the military and later the Justice Ministry authority over operations to fight deforestation, sidelining Ibama despite the agency's extensive experience and success in fighting the destruction of the Amazon.  An area larger than Denmark was deforested under Bolsonaro, a 60% increase from the prior four years.  Lula on the campaign trail last year pledged to put Ibama back in charge of combating deforestation with beefed-up funding and personnel. He took office on Jan. 1, so additional money and staff have yet to reach the front-line enforcers. But Ibama agents told Reuters that they already felt more empowered by Lula announcing environmental protection as a top priority.  Bolsonaro's government denied several requests by Reuters to accompany Ibama missions during his 2019-2022 administration. His government instituted a gag order forbidding Ibama agents from speaking to the press, which agents say has already been reversed under Lula.  ""Publicizing raids to dissuade environmental criminals is already a big change. That didn't happen in the previous government, whose goal was to show that we weren't doing anything,"" said Givanildo dos Santos Lima, the agent leading Ibama's Uruara mission.  Lula took office for the first time in 2003 when Amazon deforestation was near all-time highs, and through strict enforcement of environmental laws reduced it by 72% to a near record low when he left office in 2010.

2023-02-24,February forecast indicates record deforestation in the Amazon,134,"SAO PAULO, 24 FEB (ANSA) - The Institute for Space Research (Inpe) released the partial data of deforestation alerts in the Legal Amazon in February and the numbers already show a record for the month since the beginning of the historical series, in 2015. According to the document released on Friday (24), there are 209km² of destroyed area until the 17th of February.  For comparison, the record for the second month of the year was 2022, when, during the 28 days, 199km² were deforested. The total figures for February will be released on March 3rd.  The alerts are produced by the Real-Time Deforestation Detection System (Deter), which includes daily data on devastation in areas larger than three hectares, and encompass the entire Legal Amazon, a region that involves nine states (Acre, Amapá, Amazonas, Mato Grosso, Pará, Rondônia, Roraima, and Tocantins) and part of Maranhão.  Inpe's weekly report also indicates that the state that has deforested the most is Mato Grosso, with 129km², followed by Pará (34km²) and Amazonas (23km²).  The numbers released on Friday contrast with data from January, when deforestation alerts fell 61% compared to the same month last year (167 km²). (ANSA). "
2023-04-07,Fines for deforestation in the Amazon increase 219% in the 1st quarter,135," The number of fines for deforestation and other infractions in the Amazon region, in the first quarter of 2023, increased 219%, if compared to the average for the same period of the years 2019 to 2022. The data are from the Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (Ibama).  Added to the fines are the seizures of goods and products related to environmental violations, which rose 133%, and the number of embargoes of properties, which grew 93% in the same period. Ibama points out that these measures decapitalize the violators and prevent them from obtaining bank loans, besides restricting the trade of illegal products.  If only the operations carried out against the invaders of the Yanomami indigenous territory, located in the states of Amazonas and Roraima, are observed, from February 6 to date, Ibama has destroyed 285 miners' camps, eight aircrafts, 23 boats, three tractors, and 124 engines. Also seized were 21 thousand liters of fuel, 22 tons of cassiterite ore, 5 kg of mercury, among other logistical support equipment for illegal mining.  Throughout Brazil, the institute's environmental fines increased 78% from January to March this year, in relation to the same period of the previous four years.  Ibama justifies that the increases in fines, seizures of goods and products, and embargoes of properties occurred due to the resumption of the powers of the environmental agency of the federal government and the command of the environmental area to combat deforestation.

2023-02-27,French Bank BNP Paribas Sued by NGOs Over Amazon Rainforest Deforestation Link,137,"Environmental and human rights activist groups said on Monday they had sued BNP Paribas, the eurozone's biggest bank, for providing financial services to companies they allege contribute to the deforestation of the Amazon rainforest. Brazilian NGO Comissão Pastoral da Terra and French group Notre Affaire À Tous said they filed the lawsuit last week with the Paris judicial court, alleging BNP Paribas did not carry out proper checks before agreeing to finance such companies. Paris-based BNP Paribas said in statement sent to Reuters that it required its clients to have a ""zero deforestation"" strategy in their production and supply chains by 2025. Update: Activists Sue BNP Over Energy Loans, TotalEnergies Over Human Rights Forest destruction is Brazil's largest source of greenhouse gas emissions and climate campaigners are increasingly using lawsuits to push big companies to shift to a low-carbon economy. French companies have become a particular focus because of a 2017 French law that places the onus on them to identify and prevent risks to human rights and the environment that could occur as a result of their business activities. The case is the second to target BNP Paribas on these grounds, following another complaint filed last week. The first ruling by a French court based on the law is due on Tuesday in a case against oil major TotalEnergies BNP Paribas said it required ""full traceability"" from its clients regarding their supply chains of beef and soy from the Brazilian Amazon and Cerrado. It pledged to no longer provide financial products or services to those that do not agree to. ""Only a collective commitment by financial institutions can be fully effective,"" BNP Paribas said. ""Simply ceasing to finance these actors would have no positive impact on their practices, as they would continue to rely on a largely sufficient number of lenders for their activity,"" it added.

2023-03-22,General Norwegian Minister says Brazil has returned to environmental leadership,138," The Norwegian Minister of Climate and Environment, Espen Barth Eide, said on Wednesday (22) that Brazil is resuming the global leadership it once had, when it comes to environmental issues. The statement was made during his meeting with the Minister of Environment and Climate Change, Marina Silva. The two ministers released a joint statement in which they reaffirmed the bilateral partnership on climate and forests, which began in 2008, with the launch of the Amazon Fund, by Brazil, and the International Climate and Forest Initiative (NICFI), by Norway. ""Through the bilateral Memorandum of Understanding of 2008, Norway supported the Amazon Fund, which became the model for several other bilateral partnerships. In the following years, Brazil continued to achieve a remarkable reduction of deforestation in the Amazon and presented one of the most important climate mitigation results in the world,"" the MMA said in a statement. Global leadershipBarth Eide told the Brazilian minister that ""Brazil has shown global leadership in the past and is doing so again now. Still according to the Norwegian, the international community must spare no efforts to mobilize all available tools and resources to partner with the Brazilian government. He reinforced that Norway is ""deeply committed to remaining a close and long-term partner of Brazil"". Both Barth Eide and Marina Silva advocated a ""rapid operationalization of the resources available in the Amazon Fund to support the critical needs identified by Brazil to reduce deforestation and promote sustainable and inclusive development in the Amazon Region"". The Norwegian minister said that his country will support Brazil in mobilizing additional resources for the Amazon Fund, as well as to increase cooperation, investments and public and private financing. ""In this context, both authorities committed themselves to exchange views on how best to take advantage of opportunities emerging from different approaches, including results-based payments and jurisdictional carbon markets,"" the MMA reported.

2023-01-20,Germany's Prime Minister confirms visit to Lula in January,139,"The German ambassador in Brazil, Heiko Thoms, confirmed this Friday, 20, that the prime minister of Germany, Olaf Scholz, will visit Brazil next 30 days. The date had already been anticipated by President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, but, until yesterday, was not confirmed by German diplomatic sources. ""The chancellor of Germany has just confirmed his coming to Brazil on January 30,"" wrote the ambassador on his Twitter account. For Thoms, Scholz's visit, the second by a German official in less than a month, is a ""sign of strengthening cooperation"" between the two countries. As Agência Brasil reported yesterday, 19, the German chancellor will travel accompanied by other ministers and representatives of large German companies. An important Brazilian trade partner, Germany has shown interest in a political rapprochement with Brazil, with the possibility of allocating more financial resources to fund projects and environmental preservation actions developed in the country, especially in the Amazon. In early January, when President Frank-Walter Steinmeier came to Brazil to attend the inauguration of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, Germany announced the release of 35 million euros to the Amazon Fund, as compensation for the reduction of deforestation in the Amazon biome in 2017. Created in 2008, the fund receives donations from international institutions and governments to finance actions to prevent and combat deforestation in the Legal Amazon. The resources are used to finance projects for reducing deforestation and monitoring the biome. For political reasons, the mechanism was paralyzed during the Jair Bolsonaro administration. Early last November, the Federal Supreme Court (STF) ordered the Brazilian government to reactivate the fund within 60 days. The measure has been fulfilled under the current administration. On his first day at the helm of the Executive Branch, Lula signed Decree 11,368, authorizing the National Bank for Economic and Social Development (BNDES) to resume raising financial donations for the Amazon Fund. Besides the environmental area, Lula and Scholz, who is in fact the political leader in Germany, should also deal with ways to expand trade relations between the two countries and the growth of the extreme right in several countries. Yesterday, during the GloboNews interview, Lula said that he wants to talk to the German chancellor about how the extreme right is growing in Europe and in the world. On the last day 9, the German Prime Minister used Twitter to condemn the invasion and depredation of the Planalto Palace, the National Congress and the Supreme Court building (STF), which occurred the day before in Brasilia. ""Terrible images come to us from Brazil. The violent attacks against democratic institutions are an attack on democracy that cannot be tolerated. We stand in deep solidarity with President Lula and the Brazilian people,"" wrote the German Social Democrat, who, in addition to Brazil, is expected to visit other countries in the region.

2023-04-04,Google Earth now shows deforestation in the Amazon until 2022,140,"Google announced on Tuesday (4) that Google Earth now includes images of the advance of deforestation in the Amazon until 2022. Updating the platform with data from 2020 makes it possible to track the advance of forest destruction, which had record rates in the Jair Bolsonaro administration. The technology giant also announced the launch of an early detection system for fires, in partnership with Inpe (National Institute for Space Research), and the expansion of alerts for floods, in collaboration with the Geological Survey of Brazil (CPRM). The announcements were made at the event Sustainability with Google - Amazon, which is taking place in Belém (PA). With satellite image records since 1984, Google Earth has a timelapse tool that now shows in detail the changes in forest cover over the last two years (click here to see examples on Google Earth). The engine used to generate the images, Google Earth Engine, is already used by researchers to monitor the use of natural resources, as in the case of the Mapbiomas platform. The project was created in 2019 and conducts annual mapping of land use and surface water, as well as monthly monitoring of fire scars. See in the videos below timelapses showing deforestation advance: ""This kind of historical series is also useful for local communities to draw attention to their issues,"" points out Rebecca Moore, director of Google's geospatial initiatives. One of the first people to use the tool was the Surui paiter. ""Technology today is very important for us, indigenous peoples, not only in the protection of territories, but also to take our cosmology and our understanding of the world to other places that think that only their world exists,"" says activist Txai Surui, a columnist for Folha de São Paulo newspaper. She also says that looking back at the forest helps to show that the fight to keep the Amazon standing is collective and that the answers for this lie in traditional knowledge. ""If there is a future, it is ancestral."" The history of searches on the site shows the increase in interest in environmental topics. In the last ten years, searches on Google for the term ""Amazon"", for example, rose more than 80% in Brazil. Worldwide, the increase was more than 40%. Furthermore, ""weather"" and ""climate"" are among the ten most searched words in the country since the beginning of the historical series, in 2004. Nubia Quilombola, an educator from Amapa explains that the mapping done by Google Earth made it possible to pinpoint exactly where the gaps and conflicts are. ""We were able to show: here there is a lack of school, here quilombola died [in dispute] for land, for example."" ""We took the Federal University of Amapá to teach preparatory courses for teachers and researchers to combat environmental racism,"" he says. ""Only then did we realize how the lack of will from the public power excludes our people from the Amazon."" For the new fire detection system, artificial intelligence will be used to identify fire outbreaks in early stages by means of satellite images. Early firefighting makes it easier to contain the fires, avoiding the release of large amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere. The project is still in the initial phase of model development, and there is no timetable for it to go into effect. The flood alerts, which have been operating in Brazil since 2022, have been expanded to include 27 cities. The system issues warnings in real time on the search page and on Google Maps when heavy rains deserve the population's attention. The forecast is that the network will be expanded to 20 more cities in the first half of 2023. The reporter traveled to Belém at Google's invitation."
2023-01-31,Halting deforestation in the Amazon and the cerrado could generate a gain of R$ 1.2 trillion,141,"Halting deforestation in the Amazon and the cerrado by 2030, as Brazil proposes to do, may generate a gain of up to US$ 240 billion (R$ 1.2 trillion) for the global GDP (Gross Domestic Product). The calculations are made by Bráulio Borges, researcher at FGV Ibre (Brazilian Institute of Economics, Getulio Vargas Foundation) and senior economist at LCA Consultores, and take into account both the increase in greenhouse gas emissions due to burning and the reduction of the forest, which reduces carbon absorption. He states that it follows the logic of the CSC (Social Cost of Carbon). The calculation involves estimating the impacts caused by climate change, such as damage to human health and the environment, and the costs to remedy them. A lower global warming, for example, would mean from less spending on energy for air conditioning to a lower rise in the level of the oceans (which can devalue properties in coastal regions and even destroy them) or greater agricultural productivity and labor (in the latter case, because of the impacts on human health). According to the economist, the drop in deforestation during the first two governments of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (PT) and the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions provided, in current values, a gain of US$ 818 billion (R$ 4.2 trillion) for the world economy between 2003 and 2011, compared to a scenario in which the results of 2002 were maintained. On the other hand, the increase in deforestation and its consequences in the increase of greenhouse gas emissions from 2019 to 2022, already during the government of former president Jair Bolsonaro (PL), led to an estimated loss of US$ 201 billion (about R$ 1.02 trillion, in comparison with the trend in 2008 and with the estimate for last year). Bráulio used net emissions data from Seeg (System of Estimates of Emissions and Removals of Greenhouse Gases), from the Climate Observatory, and from Inpe (National Institute for Space Research) for deforestation. To estimate the costs, the so-called CSC (Carbon Social Cost) was used per additional ton of CO2 (carbonic gas) discharged into the atmosphere - from US$ 185 per ton in 2020 and reaching US$ 226 in 2030. Considering a linear reduction path, as of 2027, the biomes would leave the level of losses and start generating gains for the world economy, which add up to US$ 240 billion. With zero deforestation in both biomes in 2030, the capture of GHGs by the forests would be greater than the gross emissions from deforestation and fires, explains the researcher. He reminds that it is also necessary to consider that the gains are diluted in time - that is, they will not necessarily materialize fully between 2027 and 2030 - and if deforestation remains zero after 2031, the accumulated gain will grow. ""These gains and losses affect the world economy over many years, since greenhouse gases have effects for centuries, and the gains and losses are diluted over time. About five years ago it was a utopia, but today it is clear how Brazil can monetize preservation, through the carbon credit market,"" says Borges. In November last year, still as the elected president, Lula stressed in a speech at the COP 27 (climate conference), in Egypt, that the fight against climate change would be a priority during the four years of his government. ""There is no climate security for the world without a protected Amazon, and we will not measure our efforts to zero deforestation and degradation of our biomes by 2030, just as more than 130 countries committed to do when they signed the Glasgow Declaration on Forests,"" said the president-elect. ""We will prioritize the fight against deforestation in all our biomes. During the first three years [of the Bolsonaro government], deforestation in the Amazon had an increase of 73%, this devastation will be in the past,"" he concluded. Borges evaluates that the shift in the environmental policy, with Bolsonaro's defeat in 2022, coincides with the advance in the discussions about environmental preservation, which Brazil may lead in the coming years. In this scenario, the prominence that the Minister of the Environment, Marina Silva, has received and her presence at the World Economic Forum in Davos (Switzerland), lends the country a very positive reputation around the world, assesses the economist. ""We are already back with the Amazon Fund, we are back with the plan to combat deforestation and we are already recomposing budgets and ministry teams. Brazil has ambitious commitments in relation to being an economically prosperous, socially just, politically democratic, culturally diverse and environmentally sustainable country,"" said Marina in Davos. ""But we need to go for it, some results will need to be delivered soon and it will be necessary to stipulate bolder goals and a plan to fulfill these rules,"" says Borges, who highlights opportunities in the expansion of the electricity sector through wind and solar energy and the definition of emission standards. With the shift in environmental policy, Brazil can also benefit in the coming years from the attraction of capital through investors who take into account environmental preservation. In addition, the country can avoid sanctions on Brazilian products and unlock the agreement between Mercosur and the European Union, as already signaled by European leaders. ""And we can earn royalties to keep the forest standing and earn to reforest. The carbon credit market is becoming more and more global. If Brazil reduces deforestation to zero, it will have a surplus in relation to the targets and will be able to export this to other countries to meet theirs"", says Borges. The researcher adds that, although the effects of deforestation can be more clearly captured by economists - such as the increase in cattle breeding in the states of the Legal Amazon or the extraction of illegal timber - there are costs that deforestation generates that are more difficult to capture, such as the reduction of rainfall in the Center-West and even in the Southeast and South. IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO RESUME THE AGENDA, THE GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO MOVE FORWARD In the evaluation of specialists heard by Folha, the Lula government begins with the challenge of resuming the environmental policies that made Brazil a reference in international forums in past decades, but it needs to advance in the forest protection strategy. ""It is necessary to have a sustainable development project for the region allied to the goal of reducing deforestation. The Amazon is not being cut down to make way for high quality agricultural production: almost two thirds is pasture with very low productivity, 10% is agricultural production, and one fifth is secondary vegetation [abandoned areas]"", says PUC-Rio economist Clarissa Gandour. In his new mandate, Lula will need to resume what had worked well before and invest in points that have not had so much progress, such as the axes of sustainable development and territorial planning, she says. ""It is necessary to deal with the issue of land vacancy, areas that are not registered and that do not have a defined function. Little progress has also been made on the issue of illegal land occupation. Without changing the territorial order, there won't be zero deforestation"", says Gandour, who is coordinator of Public Policy Evaluation focused on Conservation at CPI (Climate Policy Initiative). The researcher remembers that it is also necessary to look at the agrarian reform settlements, which represent almost one fifth of what was deforested; it is an issue full of nuances, because it deals with families that need to survive and guarantee the viability of their lands. Brazil can be synonymous of superpower of biodiversity, in the environmental area it has indicators that developed countries don't have. It's a champion of biodiversity, but it has a hard time accepting this idea, assesses Carlos Eduardo Young, from UFRJ (Federal University of Rio de Janeiro). ""The speech by [vice-president and Minister of Development, Industry, Commerce and Services] Geraldo Alckmin, of installing a green economy secretariat, and of having a specific green economy directorate within the BNDES, expand the discussion beyond the Ministry of the Environment. I am happy to see that we now have a different conjuncture. The professor points out that the dependence that Brazil has created on export revenues from agribusiness and mineral resources will still have strong political weight for the next few years, and it is necessary to consider the challenges for environmental preservation in this context. ""But now there will actually be a debate and it is necessary that the country has the perception that it is much better for us to grow through activities that generate environmental conservation and well-being for the population."""
2023-03-27,Historic! Pucallpa Declaration in favor of forest conservation is signed,142,"Ucayali. In order to promote the value of standing forests and stop the deforestation of the Amazon forests, four ministers - the heads of Environment, Agrarian Development and Irrigation, Culture, Justice and Human Rights - together with the ambassadors of Germany, Norway, United Kingdom and the United States, as well as the members of the Amazon Regional Commonwealth signed today the Declaration of Pucallpa. This document expresses the joint work of the State against deforestation within the framework of national policies and recognizes the role of indigenous peoples in the conservation of standing forests, as part of the actions included in the National Strategy for Climate Change to 2050. In this regard, the Minister of the Environment, Albina Ruiz, highlighted the commitment of the State and the countries that are part of the Joint Declaration of Intent (JIU), thus strengthening climate action and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions generated by deforestation and forest degradation, as well as the promotion of sustainable development. It should be noted that the Joint Declaration of Intent (JIU) is a voluntary cooperation agreement signed by the governments of Peru, Norway, the United Kingdom and Germany to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to the design and implementation of public policies. Usaid participates as an observer. Sustainable actions in UcayaliPreviously, the Minister of Environment, accompanied by the Minister of Culture, Leslie Urteaga, toured the agricultural cooperative Colpa de Loros and the Association of Women Chocolate Makers of Nolberth del Alto Uruya, together with the regional governors of Ucayali, Manuel Gambini, and of Huánuco, Antonio Pulgar. Also present at the event were the German ambassador, Sabine Bloch; the United Kingdom ambassador, Gavin Cook; the Norwegian ambassador, Jostein Leiro; and the United States ambassador, Lisa Kenna, who agreed that this type of initiative should be replicated in other parts of the country in order to combat illicit activities.

2023-01-20,Ibama conducts the first operations of the Lula administration against deforestation in the Amazon,143,"Brazilian environmental agents cut through the forest with machetes on Thursday (19) in search of criminals in the first anti-deforestation operations of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (PT), who has vowed to stop the increasing destruction inherited from his predecessor, Jair Bolsonaro (PL). Reuters followed exclusively the raids led by Ibama (Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources) in the Amazon rainforest in the state of Pará to stop loggers and ranchers from illegally cutting down the forest. Ibama also launched raids this week in the states of Roraima and Acre, said the environmental enforcement coordinator, Tatiane Leite. About ten Ibama agents set off in pickup trucks Thursday from their base in the municipality of Uruará in Pará, along with a dozen federal police officers, toward a cluster of points where satellite images showed loggers and ranchers recently working on illegal logging. In 12 hours of driving along dirt roads that illegally cut through an indigenous reserve, the convoy reached five areas that were deforested and burned at the time of last October's election, which pitted Lula against Bolsonaro. All the areas are within the Cachoeira Seca Indigenous Land, where deforestation is strictly prohibited. Four of the tracts appeared to have been subsequently abandoned, with no signs of people living nearby or in the process of turning them into farms. Agents said it could be a sign that illegal ranchers have given up investing time and money to turn illegal land into productive pastures, knowing that Lula campaigned on a promise to crack down on deforestation. ""People know that in this government the inspection will be stricter and will not allow them to use an area that they illegally deforested,"" said Givanildo dos Santos Lima, an agent leading Ibama's mission in Uruara. ""If the other government had won, you would have found people here, well-manicured pastures and cattle."" Bolsonaro's government had cut staff and funds for environmental enforcement at Ibama in his four years in office, while the former president criticized the body for issuing fines to ranchers and miners. Bolsonaro gave the military and then the Justice Ministry authority over operations to combat deforestation, sidelining Ibama, despite the agency's vast experience and success in combating the destruction of the Amazon. An area larger than Denmark has been deforested under Bolsonaro, a 60% increase over the previous four years. In another area of the reserve, agents found a newly built house with several chainsaws and food stockpiled for weeks, indicating that the occupants had likely fled shortly before Ibama arrived. Flanked by police officers with semi-automatic weapons, the environmental agents made their way through the surrounding jungle to reach an area the size of 57 soccer fields filled with downed trees and piled up logs. Some wildly planted corn stalks were knee-high in what appeared to be an attempt to claim the area and then turn it into cattle pasture, the agents said. ""We're going to come back with a helicopter and take them by surprise,"" Lima said. He was optimistic that Ibama will be able to carry out more raids in Lula's government, with the aim of fining deforesters and preventing criminals from trying to clear more areas. In last year's election campaign, Lula promised to put Ibama back in charge of fighting deforestation, with increased funding and personnel. He took office on January 1, so additional money and staff have yet to reach the inspectors on the front lines. The Bolsonaro administration has denied several requests by Reuters to monitor Ibama missions during his administration in 2019-2022. His administration instituted an injunction prohibiting Ibama agents from talking to the press, which officials say has already been revoked. Lula first took office in 2003, when Amazon deforestation was near an all-time high, and through strict enforcement of environmental laws reduced it by 72 percent to a near-record level when he left office in 2010."
2023-01-18,"In 2022, the Amazon had the highest deforestation in 15 years, says Imazon",144,"Deforestation in the Amazon set a new record in 2022, year in which the vegetation cover of the forest lost 10,573 km², equivalent to almost 3 thousand soccer fields, according to a report released today (18) by the Institute of Man and Environment of the Amazon (Imazon). By satellite monitoring, 2022, which reached its highest level since 2008, when Imazon started monitoring the Amazon Region. Related news: In the last 4 years, forest loss in the Amazon was 35,193 km², according to Imazon. The area exceeds those of states like Sergipe (21 thousand km²) and Alagoas (27 thousand km²). The period coincides with the mandate of former president Jair Bolsonaro, who used to discredit data on deforestation. The government of president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has promised to give priority to the issue. The Minister of the Environment, Marina Silva, has been making statements about the preservation of the forest. In one of the first measures, the Amazon Fund was unblocked, which counts on donations from Germany and Norway to be applied in environmental protection actions. ""We hope that this was the last deforestation record reported by our satellite monitoring system, since the new government has promised to give priority to protecting the Amazon,"" said researcher Bianca Santos, from Imazon, in the material released on Wednesday (18). The institute highlighted the jump in deforestation recorded in December, a month in which 287 km² of forest were cut down, an increase of 150% compared to the same month in 2021 (140 km²) and the worst last month of the year of any historical series. ""In the last month of the year there was an unbridled race to deforest while the gate was open for the cattle, for land speculation, for illegal mining and deforestation in indigenous lands and conservation units. This shows the size of the challenge of the new government"", said Carlos Souza Jr, Amazon monitoring coordinator at the institute, in the publicity material. Around 80% of the area deforested in 2022 is in lands under the responsibility of the federal government (8,443 km²). Another 11% of destroyed territory is under the jurisdiction of state governments (1,130 km²). Also according to the report, the state that deforested the most in 2022 was Pará (3089 km²), followed by Amazonas (2270 km²) and Mato Grosso (1228 km²). All the information about the Amazon deforestation monitoring report can be found at the Imazon portal."
2023-02-24,"In two weeks, deforestation in the Amazon already sets a record for February",145,"In just over two weeks, deforestation in the Amazon has already broken the record for the month of February since the beginning of the historical series in 2015. Until the 17th, 208.7 km² of forest were lost, an area equivalent to the city of João Pessoa (211 km²). The alerts were released on Friday (24) by Deter, Inpe system (National Institute for Space Research) that gathers information to combat deforestation in real time. The data referring to the total for the month of February should be released in two weeks. Until then, the highest deforestation figure for February had been registered last year, with 198.6 km² of lost forest. Considering the partial data, most of the destruction in the month is concentrated in Mato Grosso (129.4 km²), followed by Pará (33.9 km²) and Amazonas (23.1 km²). The beginning of the year is rainy in the region, which hinders the clearing of vegetation and leads to lower numbers of deforestation, in comparison with other seasons. The current record comes after a 61% drop that had been registered in January, in comparison with 2022. At the time, specialists pondered that, even though it was good news, the reduction should be seen with caution, since the month had had high cloud cover in the region, which makes monitoring by satellite images difficult. Due to the way it is prepared and predicts this type of variation, the Deter data is used to analyze trends, which are consolidated every three months. In other words, the numbers that will give a more solid diagnosis about the beginning of this year should only come out at the end of the first quarter. Since the beginning of 2023, the Deter has already indicated 375.3 km² deforested in the Amazon. These are the first figures of the new government of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (PT), which has been concentrating its actions in the Amazon region on fighting the humanitarian crisis of the Yanomami and illegal mining. On the 15th, the Ministry of Justice and Public Safety announced a program to expand security actions in the Amazon. Named Safer Amazon, the program aims to combat actions such as illegal mining and deforestation. The Planeta em Transe project is supported by the Open Society Foundations."
2023-01-10,Jair Bolsonaro left the government setting a record for Amazon deforestation,146,"With his presidency over, the traces of Jair Bolsonaro's passage through the leadership of Brazil's destinies continue to show their traces, not only in the economy and in the brutal increase of social exclusion, but also in the destruction of the environment. According to an official report covering last December, the last month that the ultra-right-winger was in power, deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon increased 150% in December in relation to the same period of 2021. Satellite monitoring detected 218.4 square kilometers of forest cover destroyed last month in Brazil's part of the world's largest rainforest, according to data from the DETER satellite monitoring system of the National Institute for Space Research (INPE). The area, nearly four times the size of Manhattan, increased 150% over the 87.2 square kilometers deforested in December 2021, according to INPE. Bolsonaro, who was replaced on January 1 by leftist President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, provoked international protests during his four years in office over a wave of fires and logging in the Amazon, a key resource in the international race to curb climate change. Under Bolsonaro, an agribusiness ally and climate change denier, the average annual deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon increased 75.5% over the previous decade. ""Bolsonaro's government may be over, but his nefarious environmental legacy will be felt for a long time,"" Marcio Astrini, executive secretary of the Climate Observatory, a coalition of environmental groups, said in a statement. Last December was the third worst recorded by the DETER program in its eight years of existence, after 2017 and 2015. Deforestation in 2022 was also near or at record levels during the dry season months (August, September and October), when logging and fires often increase due to drier weather. Experts say the destruction is mainly due to farms and land grabbers who clear the forest for cattle and crops. Lula, 77, who already governed the country between 2003 and 2010, promised to restart environmental protection programs, fight for zero deforestation and ensure that the Latin American giant is no longer a ""pariah"" on climate issues. The hard facts Under Bolsonaro's government, the Amazon has suffered the worst deforestation since 2006, but 2022 has been catastrophic. The PlenaMata Forest Monitor, which does satellite monitoring and research by multiple organizations, notes that about 461,312,570 trees have been deforested, an average of 1,221 trees per minute, during 2022. With Bolsonaro's arrival in 2019, the figure almost doubled: from 4,953 square kilometers in 2018 to 9,177 in 2019. ""The rate of deforestation in indigenous territories is rising sharply, with an increase of 74% between 2018 and 2019,"" noted Global Witness, following the first year of the Bolsonaro government. Indigenous communities have been constantly threatened and attacked by state policies. The Atlas of Environmental Justice, which documents social conflicts around environmental issues, points out that 174 cases of environmental conflicts have been reported in Brazil, in which around 150 are active. According to WWF, because of Jair Bolsonaro's policies, by 2021 Brazil would suffer the ""worst water crisis in 90 years due to the combined effect of meteorological factors with the increasing deforestation of the Amazon."" Impunity and lack of justice has also been denounced in multiple investigations. Amnesty International launched in 2021 a report entitled ""1,000 days without rights. The violations of the Bolsonaro government"", in which it denounces multiple aggressions to human rights. Among them, it denounces the omissions of Bolsonaro's government in the face of the fires of 2019 and 2020 that destroyed large areas of the Amazon; his anti-indigenous speeches and agenda; and the constant attacks on journalists. Human RightsWatch has also indicated that ""Bolsonaro's government has weakened the enforcement of environmental laws and, in practice, given a green light to criminal networks that drive illegal deforestation of the Amazon and intimidate and attack forest defenders. The number of homicides by police officers reached a record high, disproportionately affecting black Brazilians."" Persecution of environmentalists The news of the murder of indigenous rights defender Bruno Araujo Pereira and English journalist Dom Phillips in June last year went around the world. However, it is not the only case of murders of environmental leaders. Brazil is among the most dangerous countries for environmental defenders. According to information from the Global Witness organization, which documents the murders of environmental leaders, 342 defenders have been killed in Brazil since 2012 (26 in 2021, 20 in 2020 and 24 in 2019). The situation during 2022 was no better. This organization points out that ""Since Bolsonaro came to power, he has encouraged illegal logging and mining, overturned the protection of indigenous territorial rights, attacked conservation groups, and dismantled and cut the budgets and resources of forest and indigenous protection agencies. This has led criminal gangs to invade indigenous and conservation areas with impunity."""
2023-02-10,Legal Amazon: deforestation drops 61% in January,147,"The aggregate area of deforestation in theLegal Amazon in January was 167 square kilometers, a reduction of 61% compared to the same month last year, when it reached 430 square kilometers. The preliminary data were released this Friday (10) by the National Institute for Space Research (Inpe), based on alerts made by the Real-Time Deforestation Detection System (Deter). With an area of 5 million square kilometers, which corresponds to 59% of the Brazilian territory, the Legal Amazon is formed by the states of Acre, Amapá, Amazonas, Mato Grosso, Pará, Rondônia, Roraima, Tocantins and part of Maranhão. The Deter is a rapid alert survey of evidence of changes in forest cover in the Amazon, done by Inpe. According to the institute, ""the system supports the supervision and control of deforestation and forest degradation carried out by the Brazilian Institute for the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (Ibama) and other agencies linked to this issue. The Deter captures only part of the changes that have occurred, due to the lower resolution of the images/sensors used and also the restrictions of cloud cover. Therefore, the data can be revised. The reference base for measuring deforestation in the country is carried out by Prodes (Project and Monitoring of Deforestation in the Legal Amazon by Satellite), whose database is considered more reliable, with a level of accuracy of close to 95%. Currently, three systems monitor the Legal Amazon, each with a different function. In addition to Prodes and Deter, Inpe also uses the Selective Exploitation Detection System (Detex)."
2023-02-25,Lula fails to halt deforestation of the Brazilian Amazon. It is a new (and sad) record,148,"Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon set another record in February, about two months after President Lula da Silva took office, according to official data released. The satellite monitoring system detected 209 square kilometers destroyed in the Brazilian part of the world's largest rainforest, according to preliminary data from the National Institute for Space Research (INPE) system. The area, equivalent to more than 29,000 soccer fields, includes only data compiled through February 17, but was already higher than the previous record of 199 square kilometers destroyed in the entire month of February 2022, the last year of former President Jair Bolsonaro's government. Satellite monitoring had recorded a 61% drop in January compared to the same period in 2022. But environmental organizations had warned that it was premature to speak of a ""trend reversal"" as observations may have been hampered by increased cloud cover. Under the Bolsonaro administration average annual deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon jumped 75.5% during the previous decade. This destruction is mainly due to farmers wanting to increase their land for crops and cattle, activities that Jair Bolsonaro has always encouraged. Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, 77, was sworn in as President of Brazil in early January - for the third time - making forest protection one of his priorities. Marina Silva, a renowned environmentalist, was chosen to head the Ministry of Environment, having already been responsible for this portfolio between 2003 and 2008, when Brazil managed to considerably reduce deforestation."
2023-01-01,Lula reinstates Amazon Fund and revokes Bolsonaro's pro-garimpo decree,149,"On his first day in office, President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (PT) issued a series of decrees that interfere in environmental policy. The set reestablishes the Amazon Fund, opens the way for restructuring the Conama (National Council for the Environment) and revokes the decision that relaxed the laws for combating illegal mining. The measures were announced during the solemn session at which the ministers of the new government took office and were later announced by the transition team. Lula fulfilled the promise made during the campaign and signed a decree that reestablishes the control bodies of the Amazon Fund. Under Ricardo Salles, the Ministry of the Environment extinguished the council that managed the fund, which caused its donors, such as Norway, to freeze transfers to the instrument. Soon after the election of the President of Brazil, the country, however, had already affirmed that it would return to finance the fund. Now, the Amazon Fund should see the release of the R$ 3.3 billion to which it is already entitled and should also start receiving new transfers - according to the governor of Pará, Helder Barbalho, of more than R$ 5 billion. Lula also revoked Bolsonaro's decree that created the so-called Pró-Mape program, which aimed to stimulate ""artisanal mining"" - in practice, a boost to illegal mining on indigenous lands and environmental protection areas. At the time, the General Secretariat of the Presidency said that the program inaugurated ""a new perspective of public policies on mining activity in Brazil."" Finally, the president determined, through an order, that the minister of Environment and Climate Change, Marina Silva (Rede), has 45 days to prepare a proposal to restructure the Conama (National Council for the Environment). The council was emptied by former president Jair Bolsonaro (PL) in 2019, when he excluded civil society members from its participation. Since then, the Supreme Court (STF) was triggered by the case and formed a majority to overturn reverse measure, but in practice, nothing has happened. Lula is still to sign a decree that reestablishes the PPCDAm (Action Plan for Prevention and Control of Deforestation in the Legal Amazon). The measure had already been announced by Minister Marina Silva on her first day after being appointed to head the portfolio. According to the transition team, a decree will also be published ""that reestablishes the combat against deforestation in the Amazon, in the cerrado and in all the Brazilian biomes, recovering Ibama's protagonism"".

NA,NA,150,"End of Document Rio de Janeiro (AP) - Shaking a traditional rattle, Brazil's new head of indigenous affairs recently walked through every corner of the agency's headquarters, including the coffee room, as she invoked the help of the ancestors during a ritual cleansing. The ritual had extra meaning for Joenia Wapichana, Brazil's first indigenous woman to head the agency charged with protecting the Amazon rainforest and its people. Once she is sworn in next month under the administration of new President Luiz Inácio da Silva, Wapichana promises to clean house at an agency that critics say has allowed the Amazon's resources to be exploited at the expense of the environment. As Wapichana performed the ritual, indigenous people and officials enthusiastically chanted ""Yoohoo! Funai is ours!"" a reference to the agency she will head. Environmentalists, indigenous peoples and voters sympathetic to their causes were important to Lula's narrow victory over former president Jair Bolsonaro. Now Lula seeks to fulfill campaign promises he made on a wide range of issues, from expanding indigenous territories to halting the rise of illegal deforestation. To carry out these goals, Lula is appointing well-known environmentalists and indigenous people to key positions in Funai and other agencies that Bolsonaro filled with agribusiness allies and military chiefs. In his first two terms, Lula had a mixed record on environmental and indigenous issues. And he will surely face obstacles from Bolsonaro-sympathetic state governors who still control swaths of the Amazon. But experts say Lula is taking the right first steps. Meanwhile, Bolsonaro's supporters fear that Lula's promise of stricter environmental protections will hurt the economy by reducing the amount of land open for development and punish people for activities that were previously allowed. Some in agribusiness have been accused of providing financial and logistical assistance to protesters who earlier this month stormed the presidential palace, Congress and the Supreme Federal Court. When Bolsonaro was president, he stripped Funai and other agencies responsible for environmental oversight. This allowed deforestation to soar to its highest level since 2006, as developers and miners who took land from indigenous peoples faced few consequences. ____ The Associated Press' climate and environmental coverage is supported by several private foundations.

2023-03-15,Lula's challenges replace initial optimism with government in foreign press,151,"After a first positive reaction from the foreign press regarding the election of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (PT) to the presidency and the inauguration of his government at the end of 2022 and the beginning of this year, the foreign perception begins to show signs of attention on problems faced by the new administration of Brazil, in power for two months. In a period of low visibility, there has not been just one subject that has concentrated the attention of the international press. Reports published last week, however, indicate the persistence of political, environmental and economic difficulties in Brazil, as well as challenges to be faced by the government. In total, in the second week of March 37 texts with mention to Brazil were registered in the seven vehicles analyzed - a volume well below the weekly average of the International Interest Index (iii-Brazil), which is almost double the last collection. Most texts had a neutral tone (57%), while the volume of positive mentions was 17% and the percentage of texts with a negative tone was 27%. One of the main highlights about Brazil in the international press was a report with a balance of the first two months of the new government in the French newspaper Le Monde, registering ""the difficult first steps of Lula"". ""At the head of a shaken country, the leftist president maintained an intense agenda and benefited from an established form of union (...) but also raised disappointments and initial criticism,"" the text states. Similarly, the environmental issue continues to have a strong influence on the external perception of Brazil. Instead of the optimism generated by Lula's victory, there are signs that the government is demanding action. One of them was a report in the British newspaper The Guardian about the rise of deforestation in the country. ""Deforestation in Brazil's Amazon rainforest increased in February to the highest level ever recorded for the month, highlighting the scale of the challenge facing Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva's government as it tries to undo the environmental destruction caused by far-right former president Jair Bolsonaro,"" the report said. The same newspaper and the Portuguese newspaper Público also gave space to denunciations about deforestation in Brazil from the demand for collagen products in the rest of the world. An investigation ""found that cattle raised on farms that cause deforestation were processed in slaughterhouses that serve international collagen supply chains,"" says the English newspaper. Environmental challenges got attention also in the New York Times, which published a review of journalist Eliane Brum's book on the Amazon, including criticism of the current government. ""Under President Jair Bolsonaro, deforestation in the Amazon has increased by about 60%. His leftist successor, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, promised when he took office in January to reverse this devastation; but, as Brum notes, it was he who gave the green light to Belo Monte during his previous administration, 'eloquent proof that every ideological hue sees the Amazon as a body to be dominated and exploited,'"" she says. As a slightly more positive counterpoint, the Spanish newspaper El País published two reports on important issues for the projection of Brazilian environmental diplomacy. One of them presents a report on projects to expand the supply of wind and solar energy, and that Brazil will be the leader in the region"". It also published a praising profile of Txai Suruí, the ""best known Brazilian environmental activist in the world"". Another relevant text addresses Lula's political movements for the equality of Brazilian women by mentioning the leadership of the Minister of Women's Affairs, Cida Gonçalves, and the other 10 ministries led by women, for the first time in Brazil's history. Since the beginning of April 2022, iii-Brasil has collected and analyzed an average of 71 reports per week with prominent mentions of the country in the seven press vehicles analyzed. Throughout the last 48 weeks, iii-Brasil registered on average 49% neutral tone reports, 34% negative tone mentions, and 16% positive texts about the country.

2023-03-14,Make it local: Deforestation link to less Amazon rainfall tips activism shift,152,"Mar 14, 2023( Mongabay News: http://news.mongabay.com Delivered by Newstex)   A new study supports mounting evidence that deforestation in the Amazon Rainforest correlates with a reduction in regional rainfall.Experts say this research reinforces the findings of other studies that claim the Amazon is leaning toward its 'tipping point' and the southern regions are gradually becoming drier.Environmentalists see this research as an opportunity to reshape conservation activism and policy towards local communities. Scientists and activists have tirelessly campaigned for the protection of forests to mitigate rising global temperatures and preserve humanity's future. For some local Amazonian communities, who depend on logging, mining and ranching, these claims have stood in the way of their livelihoods, creating a standoff between conservationists and deforesters.  But a new study[1] shows that these local communities should be alarmed about the future of their environment too. It confirms what scientists and activists have been saying for years: Human-led deforestation in the Amazon Rainforest is causing irregular rainfall patterns not only around the globe but at a local level, leading to conditions that wreck ecological cycles and cripple communities that live in deforested areas. Experts hope this growing body of compelling evidence will encourage decision-makers to create protection policies that can engage these communities as well.  The study published in the journal Nature on March 1 used satellite-based precipitation datasets from 2003 to 2017 to reveal that tropical forest loss in the Amazon, Congo and Southeast Asia causes significant decreases in annual mean rainfall. Even deforestation on a small scale caused some decline, but the greatest impact was observed in areas larger than 2,500 square kilometers (965 square miles) where a reduction of evapotranspiration — the pumping of moisture from trees into the atmosphere — is most dominant. At the largest scale measured — 40,000 square kilometers (15,444 square miles) of affected area — monthly rainfall was 0.25 percentage point (or 0.1 mm) lower for every 1 percentage point of forest loss.  In 2010, the main rivers that make up the Amazon basin experienced strong droughts. At the time, scientists reported droughts were likely to become increasingly intense and occur more frequently due to climate change. Image Rodrigo Baleia/Greenpeace.  'The key thing that we do differently is that we've got a range of spatial scales, so we can understand at the different size scales if there's any differences in precipitation,' Callum Smith, a researcher at the University of Leeds and the lead study author, told Mongabay by video call. 'It gives us more information about what it is about tropical deforestation that most affects the climate in terms of precipitation.'  This approach has allowed the researchers to account for influencing climate factors, such as El Niño and La Niña, and demonstrate a clear correlation between human activity and reductions in regional rainfall.  The results strengthen the case of the Amazon Rainforest's vulnerability to human activity. 'The main message to me is that this study reinforces the understanding that deforestation reduces rainfall, which reduces forest resilience and increases the risk of tipping points and negative impacts on local economic activities,' Bernardo Flores, a scientist in ecosystem resilience at the Federal University of Santa Catarina who wasn't involved in this study, told Mongabay by phone. The 'tipping point[2]' is when the hydrocycle degrades and the drier conditions transform the Amazonian vegetation into a savanna — a process that some scientists say is close to happening in parts of the Amazon[3].  Carlos Nobre[4], one of the researchers who first identified the Amazon's tipping point in 2018, told Mongabay by email that the dry season is four to five weeks longer now in the Southern Amazon than compared with 1970. 'It is very urgent to get to zero deforestation, degradation and wildfires all over that area and across all the Amazon forest before 2030,' he wrote.  A severe drought in the Brazilian Amazon in 2005, when the Manaquiri Lake, 150 kilometers (93 miles) from Manaus in the state of Amazonas, was reduced to a stream. At the time, activists described the drought as one of the worst in the biome's history and was linked to human-provoked climate change. Image Alberto Cesar Araújo/Greenpeace. Proliferating damage  The study also gives scientific clout to grassroots stories about the effects of increasingly drier weather conditions and adds to the mounting proof of Amazonian communities being impacted by climate change. 'People on the ground say that when forest is lost, it's drier and hotter,' Smith said. 'But it's been difficult to really pin that down in observations before. The scale approach that we've taken has unlocked that, so we could understand these observations better.'  Case studies indicate how far the effects of the Amazon's changing climate can be felt. In Lucas do Rio Verde, a municipality in Brazil's agricultural powerhouse state of Mato Grosso, producers are experiencing losses as they struggle to produce their usual second crop of corn, Raul Valle, director of social and environmental justice at WWF, told Mongabay by phone. Even farther away, producers in Rio Grande do Sul state are in a third year of drought[5], causing billions of reais in production losses, he added. Estimates[6] from the Federation of the Associations of Rio Grande do Sul Municipalities predict losses will be more than 12 billion reais ($2.3 billion).  'It is not solely and exclusively due to Amazon deforestation; we know the climate system is complex. But there is no doubt that this deforestation also contributes to these losses,' Valle said.  These far-reaching effects can be partly understood by the length scale of moisture recycling. 'The trees make their own rain,' Smith explained. 'Rain falls on the trees and then they pump it back out into the atmosphere and trees downwind rely on that precipitation recycling effect,' he said. The length scale of moisture recycling can be up to an average of 600 kilometers (373 miles) in the Amazon. Up to 70% of precipitation is sourced from upwind evapotranspiration, meaning the fewer trees upwind, the less rainfall and much drier the downwind regions become.  'Tropical forest loss could therefore have severe implications for precipitation in these regions that are hundreds to thousands of kilometers downwind of the forest loss,' according to the study.

Trees upwind pump moisture back into the atmosphere, which then provides rainfall to vegetation downwind up to hundreds of kilometers away. Image Russell Monk/Greenpeace. Deforestation has swept across the Amazon Rainforest in the last few decades, even in legally protected territories such as this area known as the Karipuna Indigenous Land in the state of Rondônia. Image Christian Braga/Greenpeace. A 'complete revamp' of public policies  Creating policies to protect the Amazon is more than just focusing on reducing global carbon emissions, experts claim. Instead, the impact of deforestation on local communities needs to be brought to the forefront and policies need to support regional climate resilience.  'As someone who lives in the UK, we have this perspective as a society of the Amazon as something that needs saving so that we can claim carbon credits and do our bit to lock up carbon,' Smith said. 'Any policy that comes out of this research really should be staying inside the countries and working to better the communities that actually live there.'  According to Marcos Heil Costa, an environmental engineering professor at the Federal University of Viosa, there are proposals in Brazil to create public policies based on payment for ecosystem services, which financially incentivizes private landowners to protect the forest. 'The idea is that a mechanism can be established to pay landowners to not deforest,' Costa told Mongabay by phone. 'They can receive an annual income if they preserve more than they are required to under the Brazilian Forest Code.' The Brazilian Forest Code[7] states that landowners in the Amazon must protect up to 80% of their land — in other biomes, it drops to 20%.  According to Valle, loose legislation that fails to punish those who illegally invade and occupy rainforest territory for agricultural purposes is a 'powerful incentive' to continue removing trees, despite monetary incentives to preserve the land. 'Agricultural expansion becomes horizontal because it's very profitable from an individual point of view,' Valle said.  A truck carrying timber drives through the Amazon Rainforest near Santarm, in the state of Par. Relentless deforestation in the Amazon has caused a reduction of rainfall in the biome, especially in the southern areas, where there is risk of swathes of forest transforming into a savanna. Image Marizilda Cruppe/Greenpeace.  Recent promising changes in Brazilian[8] policy are aimed at protecting the Amazon and all the country's biomes, but experts warn that policies could continue to be created in favor of agricultural development. 'We need an almost complete revamp of our public policies to adapt to this new evidence,' Valle said. The challenge of such an overhaul includes the opposition from the influential agribusiness lobby in Congress, 'who continue to support projects that induce more deforestation.'  However, policies centered on preventing deforestation and building regional resilience benefit the agricultural groups in the long run because less rainfall means more challenges to produce large yields. Valle claims the first step required is to highlight the long-term advantages of sustainable development to agribusiness leaders and challenge the deep-rooted perspective of 'the more you deforest, the better it is because that's how it was in the past,' he said.  Experts say more studies are also required to better channel local needs into effective legislation. 'A major front line in terms of research today is how to translate these non-carbon ecosystem services and put them into actual policies,' Costa said.

2023-02-27,NGOs sue French bank BNP Paribas for financing companies that contribute to Amazon deforestation,153," Environmental and human rights groups said Monday they filed a lawsuit against BNP Paribas, the eurozone's largest bank, for providing financial services to companies they allege are contributing to the deforestation of the Amazon rainforest. Brazilian NGO Comissão Pastoral da Terra and French group Notre Affaire À Tous filed the lawsuit last week in the Paris court, alleging that BNP Paribas failed to carry out adequate checks before agreeing to finance such companies. Paris-based BNP Paribas said in a statement sent to Reuters that it required its clients to have a ""zero deforestation"" strategy in their production and supply chains by 2025. Forest destruction is Brazil's biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions, and climate campaigners are increasingly resorting to lawsuits to pressure large companies to adopt a low-carbon economy. French companies have become a particular focus of attention due to a 2017 French law requiring them to identify and prevent risks to human rights and the environment that could occur as a result of their activities. The case is the second to be directed against BNP Paribas on these grounds, following another complaint filed last week. The first judgment by a French court based on the law is scheduled for Tuesday in a case against oil company TotalEnergies. BNP Paribas said it demanded ""full traceability"" of its beef and soybean supply chains from the Brazilian Amazon and Cerrado from its customers. It pledged to stop offering financial products or services to those who did not agree to this. ""Only a collective commitment from financial institutions can be fully effective,"" said BNP Paribas. ""Simply ceasing to finance these actors would have no positive impact on their practices, as they would continue to rely on a largely sufficient number of lenders for their activity,"" it added."
2023-02-04,Peru : Minam implements digital application to obtain data on deforestation in our Amazon,154,"Ukukui, is the name of the innovative digital application that is being implemented by the Ministry of Environment (Minam) to obtain information on deforestation in our Amazon and thereby design strategies and policies for its adequate conservation. In this regard, the Deputy Minister of Strategic Development of Natural Resources of Minam, Karina Pinasco, said that this tool will be very useful in the conservation strategy promoted by the Environment sector. ""Minam will strengthen the monitoring capacity of forests to measure the magnitude of deforestation and forest degradation, so that policies can be designed and focused in favor of the Peruvian Amazon,"" he said. During the launch ceremony of the aforementioned web platform, he stressed that this initiative contributes to the fulfillment of the climate commitments acquired by the Peruvian State for the benefit of the people who live and work in the forests. For her part, the general director of Climate Change and Desertification of Minam, Milagros Sandoval, said that this application was born in response to the need to bring information to the general population about this environmental problem. In addition, he said that the application will have continuous improvements to improve its performance. Eagle eyes Ukukui is an Awajn word meaning eagle. This name alludes to the fact that, thanks to the digital tool, it will be possible to ""fly"" above our Amazon to monitor the current situation of forests. For this purpose, it has been equipped with a viewer and a description and filters section; This contributes to having the information in an agile and didactic way. The viewer allows the user to ""explore"" and ""land"" on a certain virtual area to make a visual analysis. Meanwhile, the filters make it easier for the user to choose the information of interest. To access the Ukukui, you can click from your computer here https://bit.ly/deforestationdgccd The data: In the launch event, held on the eve, also participated the regional governor of Hunuco, Antonio Pulgar (virtually), the director of Greenhouse Gas Mitigation, Berioska Quispe and the manager of the NGO AIDER, Marioldy Snchez, among others."
2023-03-28,President of Apex exposes deforestation in the Amazon to agribusiness giants in China,155,"The president of the Brazilian Trade and Investment Promotion Agency (Apex Brasil), Jorge Viana, defended in China that the government and the business community should recognize their environmental problems related to the deforestation of the Amazon instead of trying to hide them. Before a delegation composed mainly of agribusiness executives, who suffer external and internal pressure for investments in sustainability and even boycott campaigns against their products, he associated the deforestation of the forest with the advance of cattle raising. ""We Brazilians should stop saying outside Brazil that Brazil has no environmental problem. We do and have for a long time,"" said Jorge Viana, a Brazilian from the Workers Party (PT), former governor of the state of Acre and a forest engineer. He spoke at a seminar organized by the Brazilian Center for International Relations (Cebri), held at the Center for China and Globalization (CCG). ""If we recognize what has already been done wrong, we will be better able to defend the good things we are doing in the Amazon or are trying to do."" China is the main buyer market of national agribusiness products. And the Brazilian President was speaking in front of an audience of about 100 local government representatives, Chinese authorities, and executives from giant companies in the Brazilian market, such as Suzano, JBS and Vale. In the audience were representatives from Syngenta, Cargill and Chinese think tanks, besides diplomats and specialists in international relations and members of the special advisory office of the Presidency of the Republic. Agriculture Minister Carlos Favaro opened the seminar, but was not present for Viana's statement. Viana cited a series of data to support his thesis. According to him, in the last 50 years, 21% of the Amazon has been deforested, an area of 84 million hectares. Another 79 percent of the Amazon remains preserved. ""I want to give very objective numbers. I said that 84 million hectares have been deforested. What are these areas being used for? 67 million hectares for cattle ranching; 6 million for grain agriculture. And 15 million (are) secondary forest"", said the president of Apex. He credited the data to institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture, FAO, and satellite monitoring entities of deforestation, such as Mapbiomas and Imazon. ""Brazil recognizing the problems it has can come up with extraordinary solutions, and those solutions can be very strong in the sense of convincing our interlocutors."" According to Viana, deforestation was reduced in the FHC, Lula 1 and 2, and Dilma Rousseff governments, but doubled in the Jair Bolsonaro government. ""We had problems with the past government. I recognize that the past government encouraged the occupation of indigenous lands and deforestation,"" he said, pondering that the productive sector and civil society decided to confront deforestation. He also said that the Brazilian Forest Code has not yet been fully implemented. For the president of Apex, when the country is able to reverse this trend, still on the rise during the Lula government according to data from Deter, it should also be considered a victory for the productive sector. He proposed technological improvements in land use and forest restoration. He affirmed that Vale, Suzano and Marfrig will recover 4 million hectares of degraded area. Viana said that Lula wants to visit Beijing as soon as possible, after postponing the trip due to health reasons, and defended the formalization of a mechanism for environmental cooperation between Brazil and China, the biggest emitter of greenhouse gases in the world, with emphasis on the carbon credit market."
2023-03-10,Record deforestation in Brazil’s Amazon rainforest shows challenge facing Lula,156,"Deforestation in Brazil’s Amazon rainforest rose in February to the highest level on record for the month, highlighting the scale of the challenge facing the administration of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, as it tries to undo the environmental destruction wreaked under the far-right former president Jair Bolsonaro. Government satellites show that a record 322 sq km of Amazon rainforest were destroyed in February, a 62% increase on last year and the highest number for the month since records began. Lula, who took office on 1 January this year, has pledged to end illegal logging after deforestation soared to a 15-year high during the Bolsonaro years. With the environment ministry once again led by the environmentalist Marina Silva , who oversaw a sharp drop in deforestation in the same role during Lula’s first term in office, the government has reactivated the Amazon Fund, a key tool for preservation, and recreated a civil society council on the environment – both abandoned under Bolsonaro. Silva has also brushed off and updated a deforestation prevention and control plan that formed the backbone of her successful policies nearly two decades ago. These are important steps, but “innovation is necessary, as the Amazon today is not the same as it was 10, 20 years ago”, said a Greenpeace Brazil spokesperson, Rômulo Batista. Crime and violence exploded under the previous government, as Bolsonaro’s disdain for the rainforest and the people who protect it emboldened criminals of all kinds, including the killers of the Indigenous expert Bruno Pereira and British journalist Dom Phillips. Addressing the crisis will require rebuilding the manpower of environmental agencies that were gutted by the far-right populist, a process which cannot happen overnight, said Batista. “The land grabber, the deforester, the illegal miner, they are making the most of this time to rush to cut the forest down,” Batista said. After preliminary data pointed towards the jump in destruction in February, Silva told reporters last month that loggers were working even during the Amazon’s rainy season as a “sort of revenge” against the current government’s crackdown. Deforestation figures are typically lower at the start of the year, as the Amazon rainy season hinders forest clearing and cloud cover means satellites are less likely to pick up on it. For this reason, analysts had cautioned against celebrating a drop in deforestation in January. "
2023-03-11,Record deforestation in Brazil's Amazon for February: Agency,157,"BUENOS AIRES Deforestation in Brazil's Amazon jungle hit a record in February, according to new data released Friday from the country's National Space Agency (INPE) The data shows 322 square kilometers (79,568 acres) of the jungle was deforested in February, according to the DETER System by INPE. The figure reveals a 62% increase compared to February 2022 when 199 square kilometers were deforested. The states with the highest records of deforestation were Mato Grosso with 162 square kilometers, Para at 46 square kilometers, Amazonas at 46 square kilometers and Roraima with 31 square kilometers. In the Cerrado, deforestation hit 558 square kilometers in February, an increase of 98% compared to February 2022, as 282 square kilometers were deforested. Many environmentalists and defenders of Indigenous peoples and their territorial rights criticized former President Jair Bolsonaro's policies, insisting he rolled back environmental protections, causing ecological destruction as illegal loggers, miners and ranchers have cleared large swathes of land. In November 2022, before assuming the presidency, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva pledged at the UN climate change conference, COP27, to protect the Amazon rainforest, telling officials in the first three years of the Bolsonaro administration, deforestation increased 73%, while last year, 13,000 square kilometers were deforested. He pledged to strengthen inspection bodies and monitoring systems and clamp down on ""environmental crimes."" Since returning to the presidency, Lula has sought to strengthen environmental bodies, created an Indigenous Ministry and relaunched the ""Amazon Fund"" that seeks to safeguard the Amazon biomass. In a written statement, Frederico Machado, a specialist in conservation and leader of the World Wildlife Fund-Brazil's Zero Conversion Strategy, described it as ""difficult to reverse the damage of an anti-environmental policy in such a short time, as the numbers for the first two months of 2023 do not reveal a clear trend."" He believes that deforestation will decrease ""when there is a consistent reversal of the weakening of the institutions in charge of inspection, and when the new government's speech gains more materiality."" ""The important thing at this moment is the resumption of command and control actions, strengthening of the organs that have been scrapped in recent years, valuing the people of the forest and their knowledge and the implementation of a sustainable economy, an area in which Brazil has great potential and can take on a leading role,"" added Machado."
2023-03-10,Record deforestation in Brazilian Amazon in February,158,"Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon and fragile Cerrado savanna hit record highs in February, according to government figures released Friday, showing the challenges President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva faces to reverse surging environmental destruction. Satellite monitoring detected 322 square kilometers (124 square miles) of forest cover destroyed in Brazil's share of the world's biggest rainforest last month, up 62 percent from February 2022, the previous record, according to the national space agency's DETER surveillance program. In the Cerrado, a biodiverse tropical savanna to the south of the Amazon, satellites identified 558 square kilometers of destruction, up 99 percent from February 2022 and nearly double the previous record of 283 square kilometers, from February 2020. The numbers did not come as a surprise: Amazon deforestation had already broken the record for February just 17 days into the month. But they were not the figures veteran leftist Lula was hoping for after two months in office, having vowed to reverse rampant environmental destruction under his predecessor, far-right ex-president Jair Bolsonaro (2019-2022). Lula, 77, is facing international pressure to make good on his promise that ""Brazil is back"" as a partner in the fight against climate change, after four years in which average annual deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon surged by 75 percent compared to the previous decade. The president's office and environment ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment. With its hundreds of billions of carbon-absorbing trees, the Amazon is a critical buffer against global warming. But studies show its carbon uptake is in decline amid rising deforestation, driven, in agricultural powerhouse Brazil, mainly by cattle ranching and farming. Since taking office, Lula and respected Environment Minister Marina Silva have moved to rebuild Brazil's environmental protection agencies, relaunched a defunct national action plan to protect the rainforest and gotten international donors to revive the so-called Amazon Fund, which includes more than $580 million for anti-deforestation operations. Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon fell 61 percent in January, their first month in office. - 'Much more work needed' - Environmental groups appeared ready to give the new government a pass as they await figures from the dry-season months that are typically peak deforestation season, starting around July. ""It's difficult to reverse the damage of an anti-environmental policy in so little time,"" said Frederico Machado of the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) Brazil office. ""Reducing deforestation will only happen when there is a consistent strengthening of the institutions responsible for policing it,"" he said in a statement. Greenpeace Brazil welcomed the new government's efforts, but warned Lula would need to find new ideas to fight deforestation, not just rely on programs from his previous presidency, from 2003 to 2010. ""These are different times,"" spokesman Romulo Batista said in a statement. ""Much more work is still needed."""
2023-03-10,Record deforestation in the Amazon and Cerrado in February,159,"Areas destroyed in the two biomes are equivalent to more than half the city of São Paulo. Deforestation is the largest in the period since the beginning of historical measurement, which began in 2015.The month of February recorded deforestation records both in the Amazon and in the Brazilian Cerrado. The finding comes from data collected by Deter, Inpe's system that maps regions and issues deforestation alerts in real time, according to figures released on Friday (10/03), The record was broken even before the end of the month, when deforestation was already the largest in the period since the beginning of historical measurement, in 2015. Accumulated in the month, the area with alerts was 321.97 km² in the Amazon, an increase of 61.8% compared to the same period last year (198.6 km²). In the Cerrado, the situation was even more critical, with numbers reaching 557.8 km², an increase of 97% compared to 2020, which until then held the previous record of 282.8 km². Together, the destroyed areas of the two biomes in February of this year reach almost 880 km², equivalent to more than half of the city of São Paulo (1,521 km²). The state with the highest rates of Amazon deforestation was Mato Grosso, responsible for around 50% of the total (161.83 km²), followed by Pará, Amazonas and Roraima. In the Cerrado, the highest rates of deforestation were recorded in Bahia (268.26 km²), also accounting for almost half of the affected area, with Tocantins, Piauí and Maranhão coming next. Amazon deforestation rose almost 60% in the Bolsonaro administration In the first month of the year, the deforestation of the largest tropical forest on the planet had registered a sharp drop (-61.3%) in the interannual comparison, in addition to having retreated 27% compared to December 2022. At the time, however, specialists emphasized that the data were partial, since the dense cloudiness recorded over the biome in January prevented satellites from capturing devastated areas in more than half of the Brazilian Amazon. It is possible, therefore, that in February the Deter registered the devastation that it was unable to capture in January. During the four years of Jair Bolsonaro's government (2019-2022), the destruction of the biome increased by almost 60% compared to the previous quadrennium, mainly due to the lack of controls and the weakening of environmental agencies. In 2022 alone, the Brazilian Amazon lost 10,277.61 km² of vegetation cover, a level never before seen since measurement with the Deter has been carried out in Brazil. The recovery of the Brazilian Amazon is one of the main commitments announced by President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva since he was elected. Already in his first month in office, Lula reactivated the Amazon Fund, financed by Norway and Germany, and of which he also announced the participation of the United States. The president also revoked measures taken by his predecessor and created a group with 17 ministries to define forest preservation policies."
2023-01-04,Resources for the Future: 'Time Satellite Information for Monitoring Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon',160,"Resources for the Future issued the following working paper (No. 22-22) on Oct. 19, 2022, entitled ""Estimating the Value of NearReal-Time Satellite Information for Monitoring Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon"": The working paper was written by Katrina Mullan, Trent Biggs, Jill Caviglia-Harris, Jime Rodrigues Ribeiro, Thais Ottoni Santiago, Erin Sills and Thales AP West. Here are excerpts: * * * Acknowledgements This research was supported in part through the National Aeronautics and Space Administration cooperative agreement number NNX17AD26A with Resources for the Future to estimate the value of information obtained from satellite-based remote sensing. Additional support is from the National Science Foundation, grant number CNH-L 1825046. * * * 8. Discussion and conclusions In 2004, Brazil began using near-real-time satellite information through the DETER program to detect and report illegal deforestation. This was the start of a substantial drop in rates of deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon that coincided with a period of overlapping public and private deforestation and development policies. Multiple changes in the macroeconomic and policy environments occurred simultaneously, including an expansion in protected areas, increases in the rate of use and enforcement of environmental fines, and changes in commodity prices. To account for and control for these factors, we estimate the change in deforestation after 2004 while conditioning on the other changes that occurred simultaneously to separate the effects of DETER from other influences on deforestation. It is also possible that real-time satellite monitoring changed the effectiveness of fines and protected areas while also altering the incentives for deforestation provided by high commodity prices or regional development policy. We use interactions within our empirical model to account for ways that DETER itself changed the drivers of deforestation, and incorporate this in our estimates of counterfactual deforestation in the absence of DETER. Our DAG highlights the assumptions that are made when including policies on or off the causal path and illustrates the two counterfactuals that we estimate as our upper and lower bounds on avoided deforestation. We find that the initially positive relationship between commodity prices and deforestation and the positive relationship between areas of INCRA settlement and rates of deforestation no longer exist after 2004. Our results indicate that DETER has a large direct, and immediate, effect on deforestation in 2004 and that DETER alters the estimated future rates through indirect effects on other factors that influence deforestation. In total, annual deforestation is substantially higher in the counterfactual scenarios where DETER was not introduced, with the difference increasing towards the end of the study period. In total we estimate the amount of avoided deforestation is approximately 652,000-677,000 km2 between 2001-2015 according to our lower and upper bounds identified in Counterfactuals 1 and 2. This is an area that is similar to the size of Alaska, larger than the combined area of the next three largest states in the U.S. (California, Montana, and New Mexico) and 2.3 times larger than the amount of deforestation recorded in that region in the same time period (282,341 km2). We also estimate the amount of CO2 emissions avoided and find these totals to be about 1.6 trillion tons. Our benefit-costs analysis suggests that the net benefits of satellites are substantial (US$733 million/year-US$4.2 trillion/year) when estimating benefits using the WTP to preserve Amazon rainforest, but that the net benefits range between negative (US$-384 million/year) and lower positive values (US$582 million/year) when estimating the benefits of avoided CO2 emissions. The negative estimates result when the current US government SSC of $51/tCO2 is used in the estimation. Brazil was an early adopter of near-real-time satellite deforestation alerts, but high-frequency satellite data has become more widely available to tropical countries in recent years. For example, Global Forest Watch has worked with varied partners in the tropics to provide GLAD rapid deforestation alerts since 2014, and in 2020, Norway's International Climate and Forest Initiative offered freely available high-resolution monthly deforestation data to any user. Our findings suggest that this type of data can make important contributions to reducing deforestation, but these contributions will depend on how the satellite data are used, made public, and the corresponding support (or lack of support) by public and private agencies. We found that public and private forest conservation policies that were implemented after the introduction of DETER significantly reduced deforestation. However, we cannot determine how effective they would have been in the absence of DETER. Certainly, these policies relied on satellite information, but they used both low- and high-frequency data. We therefore estimate lower and upper bounds based on the assumptions that the policies would have been equally effective without DETER or totally ineffective without DETER. The reality is likely to lie between these bounds, which would indicate that the combination of access to near-real-time satellite data and the motivation to use the data in novel ways can be even more effective than using the data for pre-existing policies and enforcement. Finally, we estimate the benefits of satellites using a time period of declining deforestation. Deforestation started to increase in the Brazilian Amazon after 2012, and has been at decade highs in recent years. Actually, rates in 2021 were the highest since 2006 (INPE 2021) and are on target to be higher in 2022. This reversal highlights that the effectiveness of deforestation alerts and satellite data depends on the willingness to enforce existing forest laws and penalize violations. In the absence of political will to constrain deforestation, the increasing public availability of high-frequency data raises global awareness of increases in deforestation. This can generate external pressures for conservation, for example through supply chain initiatives developed through global commodity markets, and external pressure from NGOs, international organizations and individual foreign governments to enforce and strengthen policy. * * * About the Authors Katrina Mullan is an associate professor in the Department of Economics at the University of Montana.

2023-01-27,Reviews explore impacts of Amazon deforestation,161,"Washington [US], January 27 (ANI): Researchers emphasize the quick and dramatic changes occurring in the Amazon as a result of growing human activities in two distinct reviews. They examine what is known about the drivers and consequences of the region's continuous deforestation and landscape degradation, as well as what needs to be done to avoid the worst results. The Amazon rainforest is one of the most important yet endangered main ecosystems on the planet. It supports almost one-third of all known species and provides critical global ecosystem services that help regulate the planet's carbon and water cycles. However, modern agricultural and industrial activities, as well as broader anthropogenic climate change, are deteriorating Amazonian habitats at an unprecedented rate. Teetering on the brink of irreversible change, continuous forest loss threatens to drive the Amazon above a crucial threshold, with far-reaching consequences for the entire Earth system. In one Review, James Albert and colleagues summarize key findings from the 2021 Science Panel for the Amazon (SPA) Assessment Report, demonstrating how human activities such as regional deforestation are changing Amazonian ecosystems hundreds to thousands of times faster than any naturally occurring climatic or geological phenomenon has in the past - far too quickly for Amazonian species, peoples, and ecosystems to adapt. According to Albert et al., transformative policy actions are required to prevent these outcomes and reduce the global economy demands that largely drive deforestation. ""As we approach an irreversible tipping point for Amazonia, the global community must act now. Policies to prevent the worst outcomes have been successfully identified; implementation is only a matter of leadership and political will,"" write Albert et al. ""To fail the Amazon is to fail the biosphere, and we fail to act at our own peril."" In a second Review, David Lapola and colleagues evaluate the proximate and underlying drivers and consequent impacts of Amazon forest degradation. While most analyses of land use and land-cover change in tropical forests have centred on the causes and effects of deforestation, Lapola et al. focus on other, lesser-studies anthropogenic disturbances, including fire, habitat fragmentation, selective logging, and extreme drought due to human-induced climate change. According to the authors, roughly 2.5 million kilometres of the Amazon forest (roughly 38 per cent of all remaining forests in the region) are currently degraded by these impacts. Carbon emissions from this degradation are equal to, if not greater, than emissions from deforestation and will remain a dominant source of carbon emissions regardless of deforestation rates. As a result, Lapola et al. argue that not only are deforestation policies needed but they must also be complemented with measures to address the disturbances that degrade the Amazon environment.

2023-02-10,U.S. support to stop deforestation in the Amazon: Lula's main goal in Washington,162,"U.S. President Joe Biden meets Friday at the White House with his Brazilian counterpart Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva to discuss democracy and the environment, against the backdrop of the long shadow of Jair Bolsonaro. Stopping the deforestation of the Amazon would help save 345 million people who are at risk of famine in the world and billions more who are being affected by climate change. The Amazon underpins much of the global food system by regulating the world's rainfall patterns. In fact, scientific models published in the Journal of Climate show how continued deforestation of the Amazon will significantly reduce rainfall vital to food production in the United States. In the western U.S., for example, deforestation of the Amazon could be responsible for a 10-20% decrease in precipitation. A worrisome situation considering that together, the United States and Brazil provided 66% of the world's soybeans, 42% of its corn, 30% of its poultry, among many other foods. However, deforestation continues and has already eliminated 17% of the entire Amazon. Experts predict that if 20 to 25% of this rainforest is lost, there will be no point of return . This is emphasized by Natalie Unterstell, president of Brazil's Talanoa Institute. ""The Amazon rainforest has become the central axis of Brazilian foreign policy and also an international policy issue for the US and Brazil because of its importance for food security. If it collapses, this will have a huge negative impact not only on Brazil but also on Latin America and on the fight against global climate change. That's why deforestation has to stop,"" he says. ""Lula is going to have to deliver results."" Completely halting deforestation was one of Lula da Silva's campaign promises. Securing Joe Biden's support to fulfill that promise is one of the main objectives of his visit to Washington. It is an endorsement that will come with responsibilities for Brazil, says Anya Prusa, Albright Stonebridge Senior Director for the Americas: ""The international community is relieved to have Brazil back at the table, and this relief will translate into much-needed funding for the Amazon Fund and other mechanisms. But high expectations mean that Lula is going to have to deliver results"". The Amazon Fund, which Lula hopes the United States will join, was created in 2009 with an initial donation from Norway to help combat deforestation and stimulate sustainable development in Brazil. Bolsonaro froze the fund when he took office in 2019, but Lula restarted it with support from Norway, England and Germany. But this is not the only resource to support Brazil against deforestation, as Bruna Santos, director of the Wilson Center's Brazil Institute, mentions. ""Biden in the past has promised to mobilize $20 billion for the Amazon, but there are other bills stalled in Congress that are important beyond the Amazon Fund, such as for example the forest act or Amazon21, which also represent an important framework."" It is a mobilization of international resources that Lula will have to manage locally to achieve climate goals, says Luiza Duarte, an expert in Brazilian public policy: ""Lula is trying to contain and undo the damage from the actions of the Bolsonaro government at home and abroad, but he faces internal challenges especially in Congress"". It is worth noting that Lula is planning to organize the COP30 in 2025 in the Amazonian city of Belem."
2023-02-02,University of Amsterdam: Deforestation Of Amazon May Be Irreversible,163,"(TNSjou) -- The University of Amsterdam issued the following news release: * * * The rate of deforestation in the Amazon is much higher than previously thought. As a result, there is a risk of reaching a tipping point, after which the ecosystem will be irreversibly altered. And that could have catastrophic consequences for the global climate system, writes a UN panel of leading scientists on 27 January in Science. Carina Hoorn (University of Amsterdam) is one of the authors. ""Human influence in the Amazon is now so significant that natural processes in an area of millions of square kilometers have no time to recover."" * * * About a sixth of all biomass on Earth is produced in the Amazon. The ecosystem is therefore very important for carbon storage. In addition, the area is of unprecedented value for biodiversity: the Amazon is home to 10% of the world's known species of plants and vertebrates. But in recent decades, forest clearing for agriculture and industries such as gold, oil and gas extraction, has been accelerating at an increasing rate, with a massive negative impact on surface water flow. In the last 4 years in particular, deforestation has accelerated fast, with the years 2020 and 2021 standing out in particular, with 17% more deforestation than before. A UN panel on the Amazon Earth scientist Carina Hoorn of the University of Amsterdam is a member of the 'Science Panel for the Amazon', a United Nations initiative that includes 240 researchers from 20 countries. The panel examined the rates of natural and human-induced change in the area. Hoorn was one of two working group leaders of the study on the history of the soil, subsoil, hydrology and climate of system Earth and the history of biodiversity. The report by this working group was published in 2021 and has now led to a scientific review publication in the renowned journal Science. * * * Alarm bell Together with the working group, Hoorn is sounding the alarm bell once again, because deforestation is going much faster than previously thought, the comparative study shows. ""The Amazon is the product of millions of years of development. That is a very different time scale from the one we humans are familiar with. Anthropogenic changes are hundreds to thousands of times faster than natural climatic and geological changes. The system cannot compensate for the rapid destruction we cause."" * * * From carbon sink to source On a geological timescale, nature in the Amazon is quite flexible, says Hoorn. ""We know that the Amazon and surrounding areas had tropical forest 65 million years ago. Forest and wetlands alternated and now the area is once again dominated by tropical forest. Destroying such a system is likely a journey without return. If the natural conditions are deeply disturbed in such a large area it will not be able to recover, and an impoverished, unstable ecosystem will take its place. So far, the Amazon has always been a global carbon sink, but if the threshold is exceeded, it may become a source. The Amazon's role in the global climate thus could reverse."" And due to the Amazon's huge size, this could even result in global climate change. * * * Message to world leaders Hoorn and her colleagues have a message to world leaders: ""Science is deeply concerned about the irreversibility of developments. If the tipping point is passed, it will mean the dawn of an uncertain new era, probably without diverse tropical forests."" Countering deforestation in the Amazon was already a major topic of Brazil's presidential election in autumn 2022, the country where most of the Amazon rainforest lies. Hoorn: ""Former president Bolsonaro saw it as a reclamation area. The new president Lula wants to protect it and has appointed an indigenous Minister of Environment. That is very positive."" Already last year, another group of scientists published a policy brief to turn the tide for the Amazon. They say it is important to actively protect the remaining (original) forest immediately through monitoring and strict control of illegal logging and environmental destruction and fencing off the partly destroyed or recovering forest so that it can grow back naturally. This is possible by enforcing nature policies on a regional scale and involving indigenous people, among other options. * * * Original text here: https://www.uva.nl/en/content/news/press-releases/2023/02/deforestation-of-amazon-may-be-irreversible.html?origin=zvuyIF7VQlmbnXJokCBg7g Copyright Targeted News Services MSTRUCK-8060058 MSTRUCK"
2023-02-28,"US wants 'global' fight against Amazon deforestation, says Kerry",164,"The United States' special envoy for climate, John Kerry, assured on Tuesday (28), in Brasilia, that the fight against the destruction of the Amazon must happen ""at the global level"", and reiterated that Washington will contribute economically, but did not announce the amount. ""We will work together, not just bilaterally, but globally, to bring everyone to the negotiating table,"" Kerry said at a press conference with Environment Minister Marina Silva. ""No country can change things alone [...] A big change is happening, more and more people understand that it's urgent, that it's not optional, and that we have to work together to do much more than before,"" he insisted. Kerry also stated that he intended to return to Brazil to visit the Amazon with Marina Silva, on a date to be confirmed. The visit of U.S. President Joe Biden's envoy to Brasilia took place three weeks after that of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva to the White House. And, as it happened in Washington, the United States reaffirmed its desire to contribute to the Amazon Fund, whose main donors are Norway and Germany, although they have not yet defined figures. ""We are committed to contributing to the Amazon Fund, but also to other entities, and to working bilaterally [with Brazil] on science and development,"" Kerry said after his three-day visit to Brasilia. Asked by a journalist about the amount of the contribution, Kerry talked about ongoing negotiations in the US Congress. ""We have a bill in the Senate aimed at raising $4.5 billion. Another in the House for $9 billion. But now it will take a fight"" to get it done, he detailed. Kerry was referring, in particular, to the ""AMAZON21"" bill, which foresees the creation of a 9 billion dollar fund for forest preservation in developing countries, not only for the Brazilian Amazon. Marina Silva, in turn, recalled that there were ""other instruments"" to help preserve the Amazon, such as the purchase of carbon bonds. At the end of January, during an official visit to Brasilia, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz announced that his country was willing to pay 200 million euros - R$1.1 trillion - into the Amazon Fund. Deforestation has increased considerably under former president Jair Bolsonaro, who was defeated by Lula in last October's elections. The president promised after his victory that he would do everything possible to reduce illegal deforestation in the Amazon to zero by 2030, but insisted on the importance of international aid to achieve this goal."
2023-02-03,"Warming beyond borders: Amazon deforestation heats up Tibet, says new study",165,"India, Feb. 3 -- There are no borders in the fight against climate change, cooperation is the key, says study published in Nature Deforestation in the Amazon rainforest can directly influence temperatures in Tibet, which is more than 15,000 kilometres away from the tropical biome, according to a new report. Climate tipping elements are remotely correlated, meaning that there are no borders in the fight against climate change. Countries must cooperate and take objective actions in cooperation toward the international goal, noted the findings of the study published in Nature Climate Change journal. Also read: Germany commits over $200 million for shattered Brazillian Amazon; but is it enough? Tipping points are thresholds that, if crossed, cause significant changes in a specific region of the Earth system that may be irreversible. The Amazon rainforest is one such tipping point. Even modest, incremental changes in this biome might eventually result in massive, abrupt and permanent changes to the planet. Experts from Beijing Normal University discussed the potential long-term effects and ramifications of the Amazon rainforest's deforestation in their Teleconnections among tipping elements in the Earth system report. The document provided detailed research and evidence on the relationship between tipping elements. Contemporary global discussions suggest that the climate tipping point attainment could occur with a 1-2degC temperature rise. Consequently, the Paris Agreement calls for limiting warming to below 2degC and below 1.5degC as a long-term goal. Also read: Third of Amazon rainforest lost or degraded: Report ""Logging, road construction, and warming are already today stressing the Amazon rainforest, and will likely do so even more in the future - and while the Amazon region is, of course, an important Earth system element by itself, it's also a burning question if and how changes in that region could affect other parts of the world,"" Jingfang Fan from Beijing Normal University told ANI. Some scientists define tipping points as systems that change rapidly once a threshold is crossed. The Earth has 16 climate systems essential for its sustenance. These are tagged 'tipping elements' and have certain temperature thresholds, or tipping points, beyond which even a slight change may lead to irreparable and catastrophic consequences on our planet. Once deforestation reaches this critical stage, even if all tree-cutting were to cease and new trees were to be planted, the rainforest would be irrevocably altered. The researchers have pondered what impact the gradually abating rainforest might have on distant regions across the globe. They procured and analysed global climate data from 1979 to 2019, looking for associations. Giant ice sheets, ocean currents and permafrost regions may have already degraded irreversibly. Other crucial climate systems like the Amazon might be lost forever if the world keeps its emissions open, the scientists warned. Also read: Amazonian biodiversity: Indigenous convoy to bring focus to threats during Montreal summit Proposing a climate network approach to analyse the global impacts of a prominent tipping element, they concluded that the harsh and warmer temperatures in the Amazon correlated with rising temperatures in Tibet and the West Antarctic ice sheet. They have evidence that when it rained more in the Amazon, the other two regions were prone to receive less precipitation. The paper also highlighted that the snow cover on the Tibetan Plateau has been on a decline since 2008. The researchers analysed and studied near-surface air temperature changes in a network of more than 65,000 subregions using data from the last 40 years. In doing so, they could see how changes at one node influenced those at another. The researchers succeeded in detecting a pronounced propagation pathway over more than 20,000 kilometres. They observed that its general trajectory could be plotted from southern Africa through the Arabian Peninsula, then across to Tibet. It was discovered that the journey lasted barely about two weeks. Furthermore, the experts used climate computer simulations to comprehend how global warming, caused by greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels, might modify the long-distance linkages until 2100. ""We've been surprised to see how strongly climate extremes in the Amazon are connected to climate extremes in Tibet,"" Jurgen Kurths from PIK, a co-author of the paper, told ANI. When it's getting warmer in the Amazon, it also does so in Tibet. Hence for temperature, there's a positive correlation, Kurths added.

2023-01-13,"World Bank: 'Model of Amazon Deforestation, Trade and Labor Market Dynamics'",166,"(TNSrep) -- The World Bank issued the following policy research working paper (No. 10163) in November 2022 entitled ""Model of Amazon Deforestation, Trade and Labor Market Dynamics"". The working paper was written by Charly Porcher and Marek Hanusch. Here are excerpts: * * * Abstract This paper develops a dynamic spatial equlibrium model of Amazon deforestation, accounting for trade and labor markets dynamics. It uses this model to study the impact of local sectoral shocks and policies on deforestation. Conditional on the assumptions on key parameters, the analysis suggests the following: 1) an increase in external commodity demand increases deforestation; 2) agricultural productivity gains within the Amazon region likely increase deforestation (but reduce deforestation in the rest of the world) 3) manufacturing productivity in urban centers in the Amazon region decreases deforestation, especially if manufacturing firms have short rural value chains and if complemented by investments in education and training and measures to attract skills; 4) reducing transport costs increases deforestation unless it sufficiently supports higher export competitiveness of urban production; and 5) industrial policy focused on raising urban productivity, especially in sectors with short rural value chains, can reduce deforestation. The paper then discusses how policies aimed at increasing local sectoral productivity in the Amazon region could complement other measures specifically aimed at protecting the forest. Among such measures are incentivizing governments to designate undesignated public forests, enforcing forest protection laws (command and control), incentivizing afforestation, and creating alternative liveli-hoods for farmers in rural and urban areas. * * * Conclusion This paper offers a novel view of the micro-foundations of Amazon deforestation that puts at the forefront the forward-looking motives of deforestation. When the future price of land is high, individuals engage in deforestation, even if the short-term returns to agricultural activity are low. The deforestation decision interacts with individuals' dynamic migration and occupation choices and affects the spatial equilibrium in the Amazon region. The change of perspective is relevant for policy. Deforestation is both a consequence of an expectation of increased agricultural production (due to greater agricultural demand and agricultural productivity) and a defensive strategy of less productive farmers who come under competitive pressures. This calls for an increased focus on the transition of less productive farmers into alternative rural or urban activities in order to reduce deforestation pressures. The model also shows that deforestation is not simply a rural problem. Regional trade and migration linkages offer a role for urban productivity growth in curbing deforestation. The Amazon's structural transformation will lead to higher urban productivity, providing promising economic alternatives to rural individuals. This will help reduce deforestation, especially if urban sectors have limited connections to agricultural value chains. Infrastructure is critical for both rural and urban productivity growth. Yet, improved market access for agriculture also increases pressure for deforestation. This analysis suggests that a focus on urban competitiveness can be an effective counteracting force. The analysis offers some guidance by testing the theoretical effectiveness of various compensation mechanisms. The current analysis is based on parameter estimates from the literature; future steps will calibrate it to actual data. * * * The working paper is posted at: https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/099329011022242501/pdf/IDU0c70e2b6904bc5044f00ab57083ff92196da8.pdf Copyright Targeted News Services MSTRUCK-8042038 MSTRUCK"
2023-03-23,Zero deforestation in the Amazon is now possible-here's what needs to happen,167," March 23 -- Jair Bolsonaro has been defeated in the Brazilian election against Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (""Lula"") to the rejoicing of scientists, environmentalists, and human rights activists in Brazil and beyond. What happens in South America's largest country is globally significant since, among other reasons, the country contains most of the world's largest tropical forest.   Under Lula, Brazil was able to reduce deforestation in the Amazon by 84% between 2004 to 2013 and expand indigenous rights and protection. Lula promised in his acceptance speech to work toward zero deforestation in the Amazon and to protect indigenous areas from the encroachment of mining companies and other interests. Great news. Dozens of countries and hundreds of companies and financial actors have already made bold commitments to halt deforestation. For example, Unilever aims to achieve zero conversion of native ecosystems for palm oil, paper and board, tea, soy and cocoa by the end of 2023. But, to date, such pledges have lacked any teeth in most at-risk areas. Famously, in 2014 the New York Declaration on Forests, a coalition of committed companies, countries, civil society and indigenous groups, pledged to eliminate commodity-driven deforestation by 2020. But in 2021 the group pushed back its deadline until 2030, and many deforestation activists are skeptical that this deadline will be achieved. Little progress so farThus far, even the most ambitious and well-implemented commitments have made little progress. Research colleagues and I published in October looked at the impact of the soy moratorium, a commitment by global traders and the Brazilian industry to stop purchasing soy produced on Amazonian forest lands cleared after 2006. Brazil's huge soy industry is the second largest driver of deforestation after beef. We found that deforestation directly for soy in the Amazon was reduced by 55% between 2006 and 2015. For many companies, this was a very useful achievement as it helped them meet their goals of not sourcing deforestation-linked soy. Yet it did little to protect the Amazon overall since there are other drivers of deforestation and many forest areas with the potential to produce soy were not covered by the commitments. The total avoided deforestation amounted to only 1.6% of the deforestation in the Amazon and less than 1% of all of the deforestation in Brazil during the same period. In fact, our other research published in September has shown that half of the avoided deforestation in the Amazon was offset by deforestation ""leakage"" into the Cerrado (a huge savanna region to the south and east of the Amazon) and other forest regions in Brazil. Colleagues and I have also published research on similar commitments made by cattle companies, which are even less effective than those for soy. However, given the magnitude of cattle-driven deforestation in the Amazon, such policies at least helped to avoid another 3% of Brazilian deforestation. These deforestation reductions are meaningful. But they still leave us far from the goal of zero deforestation, which is needed to avoid potentially catastrophic tipping points in the Amazon. Three reasons for failure (so far)There are three crucial reasons why these existing pledges have failed to do more to protect the world's tropical forests. First, existing commitments cover less than 50% of forests at risk in Brazil and likely an even smaller proportion of forests in other countries. More companies that source deforestation-risk products, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, need to adopt zero-deforestation policies. Otherwise, farmers still have ample opportunities to sell their products grown on deforested lands and avoid committed companies. Second, many of the companies that have made bold global commitments have yet to implement these policies outside of the Amazon and parts of Indonesia and face many implementation challenges to trace and monitor their products. This leaves a major portion of the world's tropical forests still at risk from agricultural expansion. Third, deforestation can leak across areas and actors within a region. For instance, when companies crack down on deforestation in only one ecosystem for only one commodity, deforestation for that commodity may simply increase in the area next door or shift to farms growing products not covered by the policy. This is the case for the soy moratorium in the Amazon, which led to additional deforestation in the Cerrado. It is also the case for oil palm sustainability certification programs, which reduced deforestation in targeted areas in Kalimantan, Indonesia, but caused additional clearing of rainforest elsewhere in Borneo. ...and four reasons to be hopefulLula's election is pivotal to filling these gaps, at least in Brazil. For instance, the new president plans to improve deforestation governance, which will make it much easier both politically and financially for companies to comply with or implement their zero-deforestation commitments. Supportive public policy may encourage more companies to commit in more regions of Brazil. Lula also plans to significantly reduce the power of the Brazilian agricultural lobby, even if it will continue to control a large part of congress. The lobby has fought virulently against an expansion of zero deforestation efforts. The new president can also help to implement Brazil's new payment for environmental services policy framework and channel resources towards jurisdictions that work with companies to help monitor and enforce zero deforestation. Finally, Lula will be able to attract more international finance to end deforestation in Brazil, which is a necessary complement to individual companies' supply chain policies. With this momentum, zero deforestation in the Amazon may become a reality and inspire hope for other at-risk ecosystems throughout the world."
2022-11-27,A desperate wait for water in the Amazon Amazon: ‘Deforestation is depriving the forest of rain',168,"RIO BRANCO, Brazil — In her 60 years in the Amazon, Antonia Franco dos Santos has never had much money. Food was sometimes scarce. But never in the forest, with its heavy rains and endless rivers, had she known a life without water — not until she moved to this city along the southern crest, where her reserves are now down to the last gallon and the deliveryman is nowhere to be seen. ""He'll come,"" Franco says. ""He will.""  It hasn't rained in more than a month. The community pond that Franco and her neighbors used during the rainy season has dried to a muddy puddle. And inside her wooden shack this Monday morning is a stack of dishes, unwashed; a pile of clothes, unwashed; and an infant great-grandchild named Samuel. For Franco, this makes three drought-racked years in a row, living in a landscape she never imagined: an Amazon gone dry. ""I have to hope,"" she says. ""Today will be different. Enough water will come."" For years, scientists have been warning that the Amazon is speeding toward a tipping point — the moment when deforestation and global warming would trigger an irreversible cascade of climatic forces, killing large swaths of what remained. If somewhere between 20 and 25 percent of the forest were lost, models suggested, much of the Amazon would perish. About 18 percent of the rainforest is now gone, and the evidence increasingly supports the warnings. Whether or not the tipping point has arrived — and some scientists think it has — the Amazon is beginning to collapse. More than three-quarters of the rainforest, research indicates, is showing signs of lost resilience. In fire-scorched areas of the Rio Negro floodplains, one research group noted a ""drastic ecosystem shift"" that has reduced jungle to savanna. In the southeastern Amazon, which has been assaulted by rapacious cattle ranching, trees are dying off and being pushed aside by species better acclimated to drier climes. In the southwestern Amazon, bamboo is overtaking lands ravaged by fire and drought. And in the devastated transitional forests of Mato Grosso state, researchers believe a local tipping point is imminent. The rainforest has never been closer to what scientists predict would be a global calamity. Because it stores an estimated 123 billion tons of carbon, the Amazon is seen as vital to forestalling catastrophic global warming. But during the presidency of Jair Bolsonaro, deforestation has risen to a 15-year high. Parts of the forest now emit more carbon than they absorb. If the rest follows, the impact will be felt all over the world. The stakes are highest in the forest itself, where millions of people are reckoning with a hotter, smokier and drier Amazon. Strange sights are being reported: Wells that have gone dry. Streams that have vanished. The arrival of the maned wolf, a species native to South American savannas. Even a scourge familiar elsewhere in Brazil but not here: thirst. One place in its stranglehold is the remote city of Rio Branco in Acre state, where scientists fear that the climate has already changed. The impact on public health is apparent. Acre state was struck by an outbreak of acute diarrhea last year that killed two children, and cases surged again this year. Smoke from rampant forest fires has so polluted Rio Branco's air that dozens of people are sent to hospitals every dry season with respiratory illnesses. The community, beset by another punishing drought, is taking extraordinary steps to survive. Each morning, the local government dispatches a fleet of tank trucks bearing water to a greater number of locations than ever before: schools, hospitals, the prison, and a swelling number of impoverished communities not connected to the municipal water line, where historic sources are running dry and daily existence is now organized around the deliveries. They come to Franco's enclave twice a week, on Mondays and Thursdays, when residents replenish their reserves and the tense wait for the next delivery begins anew. On that Monday morning in late August, Franco hears the water truck's arrival just after 9. But she doesn't move. The eight households in this pocket of the Adauto Frota slum draw water in order of their proximity to the communal tank. And Franco's shack, which she shares with her 17-year-old granddaughter, the girl's boyfriend and their son, is the second-farthest. On the best of days, Franco might get almost all her share, quieting her worries over what might befall baby Samuel if they don't receive enough water. But this morning is hot and dry. The community has gone four days since the last delivery. She wants to believe a spirit of sharing will trump individual need, but when she finally gets the community hose, it's late. She puts the hose into her tank and steps back. The water comes out in a trickle. ""It's weak,"" she says, anxiety in her voice. Others have taken far more than their share. It will be hours before the tank fills, if it does at all. She looks back at her house. The stack of dishes. The pile of clothes. And, most pressingly, Samuel. ""We just have to hope,"" she says. A point of no return? In the 1970s, Brazilian researcher Enéas Salati upended much of what scientists thought they knew about the Amazon. Until then, it was believed that the forest's abundant rain was a function of climate. But Salati found that about half of the precipitation was recycled. There had been a hidden source of water in the Amazon all along, Salati discovered: the forest itself. Water cycles through the biome, to be used and reused. The trees, with deep root systems, drink up rainwater, then secrete the moisture into the atmosphere. Easterly winds then carry it farther inland, where it forms into rain and the process repeats. This understanding became the foundation for a new field of study. If the hydraulic cycle that sustains the Amazon is dependent on its flora, what happens when vegetation is cut down? How much deforestation can the system withstand? Is there a point of no return? One influential study put the trigger at 40 percent deforestation. But then scientists added the variables of climate change and fire and argued that it would take much less. ""We stand exactly in a moment of destiny: The tipping point is here,"" Brazilian climatologist Carlos Nobre and American ecologist Thomas Lovejoy wrote in Science Advances in 2019. ""It is now."" The region most likely to fall first is the southeast, where dry-season temperatures in the past four decades have risen an average of 4.5 degrees Fahrenheit and rainfall has dropped by a quarter. Its collapse could have devastating consequences. Rio Branco, the Acre state capital, is particularly vulnerable. Distant from the Atlantic, dependent on recycled rain, it also sits at the western edge of the arc of deforestation, where three-fourths of the Brazilian Amazon's losses are concentrated. Over the past four decades in Acre, the mean monthly precipitation from June through August — the height of the dry season — has dropped by nearly a third, Utrecht University researcher Arie Staal found. In Rio Branco, it has plunged to a deeper low, from 2.2 inches to 1.4 inches. ""No other region is more affected by the arc of deforestation than the southwest,"" climate scientist Bernardo Flores said. ""We see it already happening: Deforestation is depriving the forest of rain."" The effect is local as well. When Rio Branco knocked down much of its forest, it killed about 200 sources of water that fed the city's central artery, the Acre River. In the coming decades, if trends continue, the river will dip so low that ""not even sewer runoff will go down it,"" said Claudemir Mesquita, a former state environmental official. ""It's an atomic bomb, and it's armed."" The world of ‘pipa' This, now, is the dry season in Rio Branco: Months of overcast skies from the smoke of forest fires. Days so hot that farmhands are sent home. The river ebbing to historic lows. And armadas of water delivery trucks, called ""pipa,"" taking over the roads. Commanding the wheel of one is a thin man with thick, shaggy hair. Over the past two decades, he has become one of Rio Branco's most ubiquitous figures. His name is Fredy Salles. And he's the water man. Every weekday morning at dawn, he drives to the edge of town, where the paved roads give way to dirt. The open-air compound looks just like everything around it: dry and desolate. But this is a ""source,"" where pipa drivers pump up fresh water from an underground aquifer that, for now, still runs deep and cool. As the rising sun breaks through the haze, Salles waits for his 4,200-gallon tank to fill. The height of the dry season is here, and Salles knows it's up to people like him to keep the city running. He drives to schools so the kids will have water to drink. He hurries to the prison to avert a riot. He fuels the children's hospital and the maternity ward. His tank filled, Salles makes the sign of the cross and pulls out into a city that every year feels more different from the one he once knew. He grew up in a community of rubber tappers, where the forest was lush and the water so plentiful that he couldn't have dreamed of it drying up. Salles is a pipa driver, here to serve the thirsty. Salles first saw such need just after the drought of 2010. He'd gone to a community he didn't know to deliver water, and was stunned to find children dirty, families with nothing to drink, everyone hungry. In the Amazon, extreme poverty was nothing new, but rarely had it seemed so raw. Salles began to see these people as the hidden victims of deforestation. They had depended on the forest — fishing from its streams, drinking from its pools — and were destitute without it. He encounters such people everywhere these days, on deliveries that take him deeper into the countryside, even to Indigenous lands, where in one arid stretch nearly 90 miles from Rio Branco, a leader of the Apurinã people waits for his water. Geraldo Apurinã, 62, looks out at the sun-wilted territory that little resembles the one in which he grew up. In front of his wooden house now runs a federal highway that changed everything here, even lending its name to the reserve: Apurinã Indigenous Territory kilometer 124, BR-317. Highway BR-317, built in 1956, brought the loggers who razed the forest. And the ranchers who dammed the creeks to capture water for their cattle, cutting off the territory's main source. The game the Apurinã had hunted soon disappeared, and the Indigenous leader saw his own people, with little food and water, become agents of the forest's destruction, tearing it down to become cattle ranchers themselves. Now the highway brings in the natural consequence of these losses: water deliveries. The flow from the water truck gushes into his drum. Apurinã looks out upon all that the highway has given him. His grandchildren play on smartphones. His house is wooden and strong. Nearby is a small store where he can buy soda and processed snacks. ""But none of this makes up for what we lost,"" he says. The wait for water For Franco, the best moment of the week is here. It's 6:30 on the morning after the water delivery. She puts some water to boil and makes tea and coffee — two luxuries she couldn't have managed the day before — and glances at the dirty clothes and dishes. The thought of being able to finally clean what needs cleaning brings her such joy that she's almost able to forget that they received far less water than she'd hoped. Franco came here from the river town of Pauini in Amazonas state, 200 miles to the north, far from the arc of deforestation. She'd lived her entire life along the bends of the Purus River, leaving only when her son and daughter asked her to come down to Rio Branco. Her son said he'd built her a small shack next to his house. Wanting the family to be together, she arrived in late 2019 with her granddaughter Sara, in the middle of the rainy season. The pond was overflowing with water. The ground was soggy and fertile. Rain buckets were full. She moved into the shack, feeling light, unaware that the pond would soon dry out, the ground would harden and crack, and the buckets would go weeks without another drop. Now four people live in her shack, and the problem seems so much bigger. The delivered water is about gone, used up on laundry. But chores remain. Standing outside her shack, Franco looks down at what remains of the pond, brown and fetid, more mud than water. Another delivery isn't due for two more days. There's no other choice. She picks up some soap and then lifts the basket of dirty dishes. Balancing it atop her head, she heads down to the diminished pond. She steps out onto a wooden plank at the water's edge and, taking care to skim the only the least-murky bit from the top, starts to pour it onto the dishes. Walking up to her shack, she sees the clean garments hanging on the line. She pulls down the sheets and brings one up to her face. She breathes in the clean smell as deeply as she can, and slowly exhales. She smiles. ""Smells so good,"" she says, and then returns to the darkness of her shack, to check on Samuel. The only thing left to do is to wait for more water. A frightening future For many scientists, the most pressing question is no longer whether the Amazon is reaching a tipping point, but what will come after. Some say the biome that rises from the fires will be a degraded, open-canopy forest. Others say it will remain closed, but deformed. But perhaps the most likely outcome is far more drastic — the destroyed forest giving way to an expansive grassland. Research suggests that the savannization of the Amazon, coupled with global warming, would subject millions in the region to potentially deadly heat. Even if carbon emissions are reduced, 6 million Brazilians could face that risk. But if emissions continue on their current trajectory, by the turn of the century about a third of the Brazilian Amazon's population — 11 million people — will face temperatures that pose ""extreme risk to human health,"" researchers reported last year in the scientific journal Communications Earth &amp; Environment. The next century could see an exodus from the Amazon, an outflow that would reconfigure the Americas. As Salles drives past a roadside inferno early one morning, that prospect seems even closer. Rio Branco already feels on the brink of collapse. The afternoon before, during a 14-hour shift, he received an urgent message: The prison was out of water. He refilled its tanks in time, but found himself worrying. Any number of unforeseen events can delay the water and ignite a riot. He passes a second fire. Flames envelope a distant field. Salles doesn't see how this cycle of fire, deforestation and drought will ever break. Most everyone he speaks with believes that deforestation is depleting the water and that those who are suffering the most are the poor. And yet, it's precisely this poverty that's being used to justify more devastation. The politicians who say developing the Amazon will bring economic prosperity are the ones here who get votes. In October's presidential election, Bolsonaro lost the contest, but won an overwhelming share of the vote in the arc of deforestation. Even Salles has voted for such candidates. Not because he didn't fear the environmental consequences of their vision, but because the daily plight of the poor seemed more urgent. Rio Branco has the smallest economy among Brazilian state capitals. People need work, even if the jobs they take lead to more destruction. He passes a third fire. Out there, beyond the rising smoke, is his next stop: Franco's community. To Salles, she's the quiet woman who lives at the back of the enclave. To Franco, however, the sight of his water truck is deliverance, proof that God is good. ""Today will be better,"" Franco says. ""Today there will be more water."" The difficult math has not changed. One 2,600-gallon tank. Eight homes to fill. Franco, too afraid to confront her neighbors in an area dominated by gangs, is still seventh in line. But she thinks she'll get more this time. Finally, the dishes will get the cleaning they need. The community tank is filled. Each of the six homes before hers takes its fill. Then her household is finally next in line. It's again late in the day. Yelling with glee, she runs down to the community hose, gurgling with fresh water. Moving quickly, she fits it to another hose, and then another. Then she places the end of the final hose into her water drum and takes a step back, hoping, hoping. ""Oh, my God,"" she says. ""It's weak again."" She looks at her shack, where Samuel is asleep. Then she glances at the pond, where she knows she'll soon have to return, and which, within the month, will be so dry she'll no longer have even its soupy waters as a last resort. She sits down on the bare ground, pulls her knees beneath her chin and, as night descends, listens to water trickle into an empty drum. * Gabriela Sá Pessoa in São Paulo contributed to this report.

2022-12-27,"Acre registers fifth highest deforestation rate in the Amazon in November, says Imazon",169,"Data from the Deforestation Alert System (SAD), released by the Institute of Man and Environment of the Amazon (Imazon), show that in November, Acre was the fifth federative unit of the Legal Amazon with the highest deforestation record with 49 square kilometers of deforested forest. According to the data, 590 square kilometers of deforestation were registered in the Legal Amazon. This represents a 23% increase compared to November 2021, when deforestation totaled 480 square kilometers. Pará leads the ranking, with 47% of deforested area, followed by Mato Grosso (14%), Amazonas (11%) and Rondônia (9%), Acre (8%), Roraima (5%), Maranhão (4%), Amapá (1%) and Tocantins (1%). In November 2022, the majority (64%) of deforestation occurred in private areas or under various stages of ownership. The rest of the deforestation was recorded in Settlements (28%), Conservation Units (6%) and Indigenous Lands (2%). Degradation Also according to Imazon data, the degraded forests in the Legal Amazon totaled 739 square kilometers in November 2022, which represents an increase of 678% compared to November 2021, when the degradation detected was 95 square kilometers. In November 2022 degradation was detected in Mato Grosso (51%), Pará (21%), Tocantins (14%), Amazonas (6%), Acre (4%), Rondônia (3%), and Maranhão (1%)."
2023-03-15,AGU tells STF that Lula's tenure is enough to stop deforestation and slash-and-burn,170,"The first positions of the AGU (Federal Attorney General's Office) have caused surprise in the environmental area. Those who follow legal discussions say that, at the beginning of this government, the manifestations signed by the Union's attorney-general, Jorge Messias, seek to soften the confrontation of socioenvironmental problems that are being questioned in the Supreme Court (STF). The AGU has already manifested itself in at least ten actions at the Supreme Court in an attempt to suspend the judgment or present extenuating circumstances for cases on the green agenda. On Tuesday (14), the agency celebrated the first victory in this series of requests. The main concern of socio-environmental organizations is that the AGU is focused on reviewing the so-called unconstitutional state of affairs, a type of decision-making technique that is applied when it is assumed that there are serious and systematic violations of fundamental rights, caused and sustained by the omission of public policies, whether of an administrative, regulatory or budgetary nature. In a note, AGU says that the manifestations in the Supreme Court seek only to inform and update the court on government measures related to issues addressed in the lawsuits. The unconstitutional state of things sustains five actions in the STF that deal with fundamental rights on issues such as deforestation in the Amazon and burning in the Pantanal wetlands. AGU asks that the judgment of merit consider the end of the unconstitutional state of affairs on January 1, 2023, the date of the inauguration of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (PT), as if the change of command in the Union would be sufficient to correct the environmental distortions. The perception among environmentalists, who prefer not to be named, is that the position has a political character and is legally hasty. The body would try to mark the difference between Lula's administration and that of Jair Bolsonaro (PL), so as not to damage the current president's image, especially abroad, where Lula is seeking to play a leading role. However, by the same token, the canetada would support the idea that the environmental destructuring is over in Brazil, which is not true. Deforestation in the Amazon and the cerrado (savannah) hit record highs in February, even after the government's first efforts to reconstitute the environmental policy. This reading is strengthened when one considers another initiative of the AGU in the STF. The body had already caused discontent among environmentalists by giving a favorable opinion on the use of the so-called good faith to certify the legal origin of gold within two ADIs (direct actions of unconstitutionality) that are trying to overturn the rule. The AGU affirms that the instrument is positive, but has been misinterpreted and misapplied. However, different public agencies, including the Federal Police (PF), claim that the rule ""heats up"" the gold from illegal mining, especially gold mined on indigenous lands and environmental reserves, and facilitates money laundering. Good faith is provided for in federal law 12,844 of 2013, authored by Congressman Odair Cunha (PT-MG). He included the articles in an MP (provisional measure) that dealt with agricultural insurance, without any relation to gold. In other words, as they say in the jargon of Congress, he put a jabuti in the law. The final text was sanctioned by former president Dilma Rousseff. Those who monitor the actions in the STF agree, however, that Lula's environmental policy and team represent a beneficial and radical change in relation to the Bolsonaro administration, whose government was marked by negationism in the area. Environmentalists warn, however, that a good part of the actions in the STF deal with failures that were aggravated by Bolsonaro, but that already existed before and remain in the current scenario. ""There are structural problems in the Brazilian socio-environmental policy. For many years we have been champions in deforestation and one of the leaders in violence against environmental defenders. These problems were deeply aggravated during the Bolsonaro government, producing very serious damage,"" says lawyer Rafael Giovanelli, from WWF-Brazil. ""The new government has adopted important measures to solve the issue, but there is still much to be done. It is important that these cases be judged and that the STF give a firm answer, so that the calamity of recent years is never repeated."" For Paulo Busse, a lawyer with the Climate Observatory, the AGU needs to make the reasons for its positions clearer. ""The AGU needs to explain what it is getting at with its petitions, because saying that there can no longer be an unconstitutional state of affairs in Brazil does not help the environmental agenda, the indigenous peoples, the Amazon, nor the MMA [Ministry of Environment and Climate Change] or the government itself. The structural problems are still there"", he says. Busse also states that the judicial recognition of the unconstitutional state of things opens the way for an official mobilization of the State's own bodies and entities in a joint counter-offensive to monitor and demand the adoption of new actions, capable of reconstituting normality. During the Bolsonaro government, several cases, on the most different fronts, have resorted to this technique in the STF. There are cases in progress that deal with culture, abortion, racism, and the street population, for example. The AGU has requested review only of the green agenda, where the court's position has already begun to be demarcated. In December 2022, the minister Carmem Lúcia pronounced a vote in which she recognized the weakening of the normative framework in environmental matters and the unconstitutional state of things in Brazil when evaluating two actions that deal with deforestation in the Amazon forest, ADPF 760 and ADO 54. The trial was suspended at the request of Justice André Mendonça, In its manifestations to the court on the issue, the AGU states that the Lula government changed the scenario. ""Given the substantial change in the factual and normative framework in which the allegations of non-compliance with the fundamental precepts are sustained, translated here into the actions that have been implemented as of January 1, 2023 and that will be continued and increased henceforth, ensuring the resumption of the State's unequivocal commitment to the environmental issue, there is, therefore, the cessation of the unconstitutional state of affairs,"" says the petition signed by Messias. The MMA also made manifestations in technical notes about the unconstitutional state of things, but in a different tone, highlighting that the government is working to reverse the current scenario. In the first decision favorable to AGU, on Tuesday, which does not deal with the unconstitutional state of things, the minister Gilmar Mendes recognized the change in management and the loss of object of ADPF (Argument of breach of fundamental precept) 981. The recognition of the loss of object of an action leads to the suspension of the trial. This ADPF pointed out the dismantling of the socio-environmental education structure in the ministries of Education and Environment and requested the revocation of three decrees, one from the administration of Michael Temer (MDB) and two from the Bolsonaro government, which have already been suspended by Lula.

2022-12-03,Although Deforestation In Brazilian Amazon Drops Devastation Is Still Widespread,171,"Dec 03, 2022( Latin Times: http://www.latintimes.com Delivered by Newstex)   As incoming President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva works to reestablish protection for the vital rainforest, new government data reveals that deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon has decreased in the 12 months up through July.  11,568 sq km (4,466 sq miles) or more of Brazilian Amazon forest cover was lost between August 2021 and July 2022, according to statistics from the national space agency (INPE) released on Wednesday, Nov. 30, Al Jazeera reported[1].  When compared to the same time last year, when Brazil's far-right President Jair Bolsonaro was in office, deforestation had decreased by 11% since then.  According to environmentalists, Bolsonaro managed the Amazon in a catastrophic manner for four years during which time he was accused of undermining Indigenous and environmental conservation organizations in favor of agri-business and mining interests.  According to INPE data, average yearly deforestation increased under the former army captain by 75.5 percent over the previous decade and by 59.5 percent during the preceding four years.  Lula, a left-wing politician who prevailed in a close election last month, has vowed to stop all deforestation as soon as he takes office on Jan. 1.  Senator-elect Flavio Dino of Brazil, who is serving as Lula's transition team's public security director, informed the media on Wednesday that the incoming administration would establish a new federal police unit specializing in environmental crimes.  The planned unit, according to Dino, would take a comprehensive picture of crimes in the Amazon, where gang violence, illegal mining, deforestation, and drug trafficking are frequently intertwined.  Under Bolsonaro indigenous leaders had expressed concern about the dangers to their communities in the Brazilian Amazon, particularly in regions with little government oversight that farmers, miners, and poachers are trying to take control of and exploit.  Last year, 226 Indigenous lands in 22 Brazilian states were the targets of 305 cases of ""invasions, illegal exploitation of resources, and damage to property,"" according to the Indigenous Missionary Council.  That was up from 109 such incidents in 2018, the year before Bolsonaro took office, a 180 percent increase.  In locations where Amazon deforestation is taking place, Lula could encounter fierce political opposition. He must alsodeal with the difficulty of policing such vast, often remote areas.

2023-01-04,Amazon: more than 80% of protected areas are threatened,172,"By 2023, if the pace of logging is not stopped, the Amazon Rainforest may lose another 11,805 km² of native forest, according to an estimate by the artificial intelligence platform PrevisIA. The size of almost 10 cities in Rio de Janeiro, the predicted devastation will cause even more emissions of greenhouse gases, which are related to the greater frequency and intensity of extreme weather phenomena. Among them are heavy rains, cold and heat waves and prolonged droughts. Developed by Imazon in partnership with Microsoft and Fundo Vale, the tool has already shown an accuracy of almost 80% in predicting deforestation in 2022, which consolidates it as a relevant technology to assist forest protection actions. To validate how accurate PrevisIA was, the researchers crossed the areas that the platform predicted to be at risk of deforestation between August 2021 and July 2022 with the devastation registered by Imazon's Deforestation Alert System (SAD) in the same period. And the result was that 78.2% of the destruction occurred within 4 km of the area indicated by the platform. If this happens, the platform estimates that 2023 will have the second largest deforestation since 2008, second only to 2021. Like Prodes, the federal system that annually monitors deforestation in the Amazon, PrevisIA's risk calculation takes into account the so-called ""deforestation calendar"", which runs from August of one year to July of the following year. Among the nine states that make up the Legal Amazon, the most critical in relation to the risk of deforestation in 2023 are the three largest: Pará, Amazonas and Mato Grosso. Together, they represent 73% of the area under threat of deforestation in 2023 (8,582 km²), according to PrevisIA. This means that state governments will also need to act to prevent this estimate from being realized. Next is Acre, which despite being the second smallest state in the Legal Amazon presented the fourth largest area at risk of deforestation in PrevisIA: 1,269 km². The fifth largest area under threat is Rondônia, 1,094 km², a state that, like Acre, borders Amazonas. On the tool's map it is possible to see that the forests under greatest risk in these states are precisely on their borders, where there is an area of agricultural expansion called Amacro. Besides the states, PrevisIA also points out the municipalities with the forest areas under the greatest risk of devastation in 2023. Among the first 10, half are in Pará. Of the 803 protected areas in the Amazon (indigenous lands, conservation units and quilombola territories), 653 are at risk of deforestation in 2023, according to PrevisIA. This represents 81% of all protected territories. Regarding the total area at risk in the Amazon, 1,806 km² (15%) are within protected areas. The most threatened are the conservation units, where 1,357 km² of forest are at risk of being cut down. Next are the indigenous lands, with 433 km², and the quilombola territories, with 16 km².

2022-11-30,"Amazon deforestation drops 11% YoY, but upward trend signals record high",173,"Deforestation in the Amazon fell by 11.27% in the period from August 1, 2021, to July 31, 2022, reaching 11,568 square kilometers. In the previous period, the forest area cut down in the nine states of the Legal Amazon totaled 13,038 square kilometers. There is not much to celebrate, however, as the good news is dwarfed by what was seen in the region from August to October – 4,020 square kilometers of the forest came to the ground, the largest area recorded in the period since 2015. The performance of the last few months of the Bolsonaro administration reveals a 45% increase in deforestation alerts in the region, a strong upward trend that is left as a legacy for the 2023 result, already under President-elect Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. “The Lula administration will inherit this deforestation,” said a source. The deforestation of 11,568 square kilometers has been unveiled on the website of the National Space Research Institute (Inpe). This is the estimate of the Legal Amazon deforesting system Prodes, the official annual data used by the Brazilian government. The deforested area is equivalent to Jamaica’s territory, the note of the Climate Observatory says. The data from Prodes must be taken with a pinch of salt. There was a decline, but it is a picture of the past. The present trend is surprisingly high, at a moment when inspection agencies have been dismantled and there is no budget or staff to contain the destruction. The Bolsonaro administration ends with an increase of almost 60% in the rate of deforestation in the Amazon to the previous four years of the Rousseff and Temer administrations. “It is the highest percentage increase in a presidential term since satellite measurements began in 1998,” highlights the Climate Observatory press release. The state that deforested the most was again Pará, with 4,141 square kilometers, although it registered a decrease of 20.94% compared to the previous period. Of the nine states of the Legal Amazon, the only one that did not see a reduction in the deforested area was Amazonas, with an increase of 13% to the previous period (2,607 square kilometers). Amazonas, which until a few years ago was the most preserved state in the Amazon, has started to suffer strong pressure. One reason is the expected paving of BR-319, the highway that connects Manaus to Porto Velho and cuts through the state with its mass of intact forests. “The current tendency in Amazonas, if nothing is done, is that the tragedy that occurred around BR-163 (Cuiabá-Santarém), in Pará, which became the epicenter of deforestation at the beginning of the century, after the announcement of its paving, will be repeated in the axis of BR-319,” states the note from the Climate Observatory. The appalling performance of the quarter is based on deforestation alerts in the Legal Amazon according to data from Deter-B, an alert system developed by Inpe. According to Deter, from August to October 2021, for example, the deforested area in the Legal Amazon was 2,779 square kilometers. In the same period in 2010, it was 3,723 square kilometers. “The Bolsonaro administration has been a forest destruction machine. It took the country with a deforestation rate of 7,500 km2 in the Amazon and is delivering it with 11,500 km2. The only thing to celebrate is the fact that this government has come to an end,” said Marcio Astrini, executive secretary of the Climate Observatory, in the press release.

2022-11-30,Amazon deforestation in Brazil remains near 15-year high,174," Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon slowed slightly last year, a year after a 15-year high, according to closely watched numbers published Wednesday. The data was released by the National Institute for Space Research.  The agency’s Prodes monitoring system shows the rainforest lost an area roughly the size of Qatar, some 11,600 square kilometers (4,500 square miles) in the 12 months from August 2021 to July 2022.  That is down 11% compared to the previous year, when over 13,000 square kilometers (5,000 square miles) were destroyed. For more than a decade it looked as though things were getting better for the Brazilian Amazon. Deforestation had declined dramatically and never rose back above 10,000 square kilometers. That was before the presidency of far-right President Jair Bolsonaro , beginning in January 2019.  This will be the last report published under Bolsonaro, as he lost his reelection bid and will leave office Jan. 1. But part of the destruction that took place on his watch will not appear until next year, including the key months from August to October of 2022. A preview of those months comes from a different federal satellite system that issues faster but less accurate data: It shows deforestation skyrocketed 45% over the August to October period the prior year. Traditionally, that time of year sees peak destruction, due to the dry season. An analysis of the new yearly data from Climate Observatory, a network of environmental groups, shows that in the four years of Bolsonaro's leadership, deforestation rose 60% over the previous four years. That is the largest percentage rise under a presidency since satellite monitoring began in 1998. In one state, Para, a fierce rate of destruction went down by 21% yet it was still the center of one-third of all Brazil's Amazon forest loss. Part of the tree cutting and burning happens in areas that are ostensibly protected. One such area is Paru State Forest, where the nonprofit Amazon Institute of People and the Environment registered 2 square kilometers (0.7 square miles) of deforestation in just October. “In recent years, deforestation has reached protected areas where previously there was almost no destruction,"" Jacqueline Pereira, a researcher with the Amazon Institute, told The Associated Press. “In Paru's region, the destruction is driven by lease of land for soybean crops and cattle.” Another critical area is the southern part of the state of Amazonas , the only state that increased deforestation in the most recent data, by 13% compared to the year before. It's largely attributable to Bolsonaro's push to pave about 400 kilometers (250 miles) of the only road that connects Manaus, home to 2.2 million people, with Brazil's larger urban centers further south. Most Amazon deforestation occurs alongside roads where access is easier and land value is higher. Researchers and environmentalists have blamed Bolsonaro's policies for the surge in deforestation. The administration weakened environmental agencies and backed legislative measures to loosen land protections in the name of economic development, paired with a view of occupying a sparsely-populated territory at any cost. This policy has emboldened land robbers and spurred more illegal mining. Bolsonaro's successor, leftist former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, promised cheering crowds at the recent U.N. climate conference in Egypt to end all deforestation in the whole country by 2030. “There will be no climate security if the Amazon isn’t protected,” he said. The last time da Silva was president, from 2003 to 2010, deforestation fell sharply. On the other hand, he backed initiatives that set in motion destruction in the long run, such as the construction of the mammoth Belo Monte hydroelectric dam and generous loans to the beef industry. Chopping down forest for pasture is the primary driver of deforestation. The Amazon rainforest, which covers an area twice the size of India, acts as a buffer against climate change by absorbing large amounts of carbon dioxide. It’s also the most biodiverse forest in the world, and the home of tribes that have lived in the forest for thousands of years, some of them living in isolation. “If da Silva wants to decrease forest destruction by 2023, he must have zero tolerance for environmental crime from Day One of his administration. That includes holding accountable those who sabotaged environmental governance in the country while in office over the past four years,” says Marcio Astrini, executive secretary of the Climate Observatory. ___ Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

2022-11-04,"Amazon deforestation reaches 15-year high and ""sustainable"" fuels are largely to blame",175,"In Europe they are known as ""biofuels"" or ""sustainable fuels"". However, they are not very sustainable. As part of the discourse on energy transition and decarbonization of transport, they have gained significant momentum because their burning and consumption tends to generate fewer emissions into the atmosphere. Despite this, this type of fuel has a hidden side linked to its production process. In order to reach the vehicle's fuel tank, huge quantities of soy vegetable oils are required, the production of which is closely linked to the loss of biodiversity and large forested areas in the Global South. In 2021, Brazil's Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais (INPE) recorded the highest peak in deforestation in the last 15 years, an increase that fits within an upward trend in which the loss of forested hectares has become widespread. Now, a publication by the European group Transport&Environment has published research linking this expansion of logging to the European Union's increased demand for soy and palm biofuels. The trend in deforestation rates is bringing some regions back to the records of the 1990s and this is being exploited by agribusinesses, which are occupying the land and establishing new plantations. Europe, says this research, has become the perfect customer, since in the last five years it has doubled its demand for soy vegetable oils to manufacture so-called biofuels. Fifteen years ago, practically the entire weight of soybean imports by the EU was based on food uses. So much so that, from 2005 to date, 40% of the increase in deforestation in the Amazon associated with soy is directly linked to the demand for biofuels in Europe. In current figures, 30% of the soybeans that the old continent brings from the other side of the Atlantic are destined for the manufacture of fuels classified as sustainable. Furthermore, only 20% of the soybeans grown in the Amazon are destined for direct consumption. In other words, most of the production associated with deforestation has to do with foreign demand, whether for biofuels or to produce food. But why does Europe increasingly want soy instead of other compatible vegetable oils to make biofuels? T&E experts blame this sort of apogee on the European Union's decision to classify palm oil as a high-risk raw material and urge the elimination of its presence in fuels by 2030. The production generated with this type of oil has not been eliminated, but has been oriented towards soy, further concentrating the impacts. This is why European conservation groups are demanding that the European Commission classify soy as a high-risk raw material for deforestation and that, in addition, all other vegetable crops used to produce biofuels be banned. In this way, the aim is to prevent the soybean ban from leading to an increase in other agribusinesses associated with massive logging. From Ecologists in Action, they point out to Público that Spain plays a crucial role in all this ecological devastation, since between 2017 and 2021 it has become the second European country that used the most soybean oil to manufacture fuels, only behind Germany. They thus recall that European states have the capacity to legislate at the national level and prevent the import of products with a value chain tainted by deforestation."
2022-09-23,Amazon deforestation worsened more where cattle herd grew most,176,"The five Brazilian municipalities with the largest increase in cattle herds between 2020 and 2021, all located in the so-called Legal Amazon, accounted for almost one-fifth (17%) of all deforestation carried out in the region last year. The cattle herds of Marabá, Altamira, São Félix do Xingu, and Novo Repartimento (Pará) and Porto Velho (Rondônia) gained 591,700 new heads last year, according to data from the Municipal Cattle Survey released Thursday by Brazil's statistics agency IBGE. The country had a total of 224 million head of cattle last year, 6 million more than in 2020. Those same municipalities reported deforestation of 2.2 million hectares in 2021, according to the most recent data from Prodes, of the National Space Research Institute (Inpe). This accounted for 17% of the entire deforested area in the Legal Amazon, which exceeded 13 million hectares this year. In Marabá, where the cattle herd grew most last year, 73,600 hectares were deforested. In Altamira, the second municipality where the number of animals increased the most, deforestation extended to over 765,500 hectares. São Félix do Xingu, which was for years the leader in cattle herd, was the third municipality with the biggest increase, with a hike of 106,000 animals in 2021. Also last year, deforestation in the municipality reached 577,000 hectares. Another highlight was Porto Velho, the capital of Rondônia, where the herd grew by 86,000 animals and 619,300 hectares were deforested. Novo Repartimento was the fifth municipality that saw its herd grow the most last year, with an increase of 82,600 heads, and where 190,500 hectares were deforested. This concentration of deforestation rates in municipalities where cattle-raising advanced the most was already seen in previous years. In 2020, the five municipalities where the number of animals in the country grew the most also accounted for 14% of the deforestation in the Legal Amazon in the period. In that year, the municipalities where the number of animals increased the most were Novo Repartimento, Pacajá, Marabá, and São Félix do Xingu - all in the state of Pará. ""In the [municipalities] champions of deforestation, cattle are side by side with land expansion. They need to increase the herd to establish land tenure. So, the expansion [of the herd] is not necessarily something that indicates an increase in the economic relevance of cattle ranching in Brazil. Many times, it is more linked to a process of land grabbing than meat production,"" said Raoni Rajão, a professor at the Minas Gerais Federal University and a researcher at the Washington-based Wilson Center.

2023-01-12,Amazon Fund and the end of deforestation may yield R$ 95 billion in ten years,177,"The reactivation of the Amazon Fund and the shift in environmental policy with the change of government should increase the flow of financing for forest preservation and combating deforestation. The Amazon Fund has about R$ 3.7 billion and may receive new donations. The new environmental policy may facilitate the launching of carbon credits in voluntary markets and access to resources of other initiatives, such as the Leaf Coalition, with US$ 1.5 billion in donations from governments and corporations. If the supply of resources can increase, Brazil's potential is gigantic. Considering the minimum price of US$ 10 per carbon credit (one credit is equal to avoiding the emission of one ton of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere), the elimination of deforestation, legal and illegal, in the Amazon would allow the country to raise US$ 18.2 billion (about R$ 95.3 billion) in ten years. The estimate is in a June report, prepared by researchers from the non-profit organization Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) for the Amazon 2030 project, and was based on the minimum price offered by the Leaf Coalition. The Leaf Coalition (Leaf), a public-private partnership, was launched in April 2021. The launch was made at an environmental conference called by US President Joe Biden, which marked the turning point in US policy toward the sector. The goal was to amass $1 billion by the end of that year at COP-26, the United Nations climate summit. Donations from the United States, the United Kingdom, and Norway, among governments, and multinationals such as Amazon, Nestlé, Unilever, Bayer, McKinsey, Boston Consulting Group, Salesforce, Airbnb, and GSK were the first. A year later, the coalition arrived at COP-27 in Egypt with $1.5 billion. On the government side, South Korea joined. Among companies, the fashion chain H&M and Volkswagen were the most recent adherents, in a group that now has 27 corporations, including companies yet to be announced. The value obtained with the preserved forest, the calculation indicates, may jump to US$ 26 billion in ten years if, from 2027 to 2031, the average price of the credit is US$ 15. The Leaf Coalition is a REDD+ initiative (an acronym for ""reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation""). The logic is to form funds to financially reward emerging countries for reducing emissions of gases associated with deforestation by remunerating national or subnational governments for keeping their forests standing. The Amazon Fund, operated by the National Bank for Economic and Social Development (BNDES), supports projects for preservation, sustainable development, or combating illegal logging. They are proposed by governments, educational institutions or non-profit entities, which reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with deforestation. The BNDES selects who receives the funds, according to criteria defined by the donors. The Leaf Coalition has a different model. The objective is to remunerate the results presented, that is, to invest resources for the purchase of carbon credits generated by reductions in gas emissions, certified according to several criteria. Members of the coalition present the proposal to receive funding, after proving that they have reduced emissions by adopting several types of measures. For this reason, says Juliana Santiago, director of Emergent, an American non-profit institution that coordinates the coalition, the Amazon Fund and Leaf can be complementary. Amazon states and even the Union will be able to present proposals to receive funding for actions that have previously been supported by the Amazon Fund. With the project completed, the result of the emissions cut can serve as a proposal for Leaf funding, after proof. ""This keeps the cycle of climate finance permanent and positive for Brazil,"" says Juliana, a licensed BNDES employee and head of the department responsible for the Amazon Fund from 2013 to 2018. At COP-27, there were ""letters of intent"" signed with four states - Amapá, Amazonas, Mato Grosso and Pará. From 2019 to 2022, Brazil isolated itself in global climate debates in face of the escalation of environmental crimes in the country and the posture of the Jair Bolsonaro (PL) administration.

2023-04-08,Amazon has 2nd quarter with highest deforestation since 2016,178,"Deforestation in the Amazon in the first quarter was the second highest since 2016, when the historical series for this period of the Deter alert system began, from the National Institute for Space Research (Inpe), an agency of the Ministry of Science and Technology. In the Cerrado, whose historical series begins in 2019, the first quarter set a devastation record. In the Cerrado, 1,357.38 square kilometers were lost between January and March. In the Amazon Forest, 844.7 square kilometers were deforested in the same period. In March, the biomes registered 357.68 square kilometers and 356.14 square kilometers, respectively, of deforestation. The March data is the third monthly Deter in the Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (PT) government, which said it had a goal of zero deforestation in the Amazon and combat areas of devastation in the biome, such as illegal mining. In the previous four years, the Jair Bolsonaro (PL) government was criticized for weakening the agencies fighting environmental crimes. One of the expectations of the new government to increase protection is the resumption of the Amazon Fund, a program that receives donations from European countries, which had been paralyzed during the last administration. The growing numbers of devastation in the two biomes were driven by the high levels, especially in February. March closes the period of heavy clouds and rain, when destruction figures are historically lower. This year, however, the data of growing deforestation is already worrying. The Deter alerts serve to point out the most devastated areas and guide the actions of agencies such as Ibama and the Chico Mendes Biodiversity Institute (ICMBio). Protection In spite of the advance of deforestation in the Amazon, the biome is the only one in the country with 80% protection conferred by the Forest Code. In the others, like the Cerrado, one of the measures advocated by specialists is the analysis and validation of the Rural Environmental Registry (CAR) made by the rural landowner or squatter. The CAR, not validated, is used by violators as an instrument to try to legitimize irregular land occupations and land grabbing.  The information is from the newspaper O Estado de S. Paulo.

2023-01-18,"Amazon lost almost 3 thousand soccer fields per day in 2022, points Imazon",179,"In 2022, deforestation in the Amazon was the highest recorded in 15 years. This is what the monitoring of the Institute of Man and Environment of the Amazon (Imazon) warns. Between January and December, 10,573 km² were devastated, the equivalent to the cutting down of almost three thousand soccer fields of forest per day. Last year also saw the fifth consecutive annual record of deforestation. Accumulated over the last four years (2019-2022), it reached 35,193 km² - an area that exceeds the size of two Brazilian states: Sergipe (21 thousand km²) and Alagoas (27 thousand km²). The Minister of the Environment and Climate Change, Marina Silva, said in Davos, where she is participating in the World Economic Forum, that the Lula government is committed to ""zero deforestation"". She also mentioned that she has been seeking the path of global philanthropy to attract more investments to the Amazon. ""Even a group of philanthropic institutions that wants to invest in the Amazon Fund is already being organized,"" she declared. Top deforesters Pará (3,874 km²), Amazonas (2,575 km²), and Mato Grosso (1,604 km²) remain at the top of the largest deforesters since 2019. According to Imazon, Amazonas and Mato Grosso had an increase in destruction compared to 2021 in both federal and state areas. ""We hope that this was the last deforestation record reported by our satellite monitoring system, as the new government has promised to prioritize protecting the Amazon. But, for this to happen, it is necessary that the administration seeks maximum effectiveness in the measures to combat devastation, such as those already announced to return to the demarcation of indigenous lands, restructure the inspection bodies and encourage the generation of income from standing forest"", says Bianca Santos, Imazon researcher. In December alone, the Amazon lost 287 km² of forest, an increase of 105% in relation to the same month in 2021, when 140 km² were devastated. This was the month that had the highest deforestation rate of the year. With this, 2022 also had the worst December since 2008, when Imazon's monitoring began. State Conservation Units With regard to protected areas, the state conservation units (UCs) were in a more critical situation in 2022. In these territories, the devastation increased from 690 km² in 2021 to 746 km² in 2022, an 8% increase. Despite being under great pressure, the federal conservation units and indigenous lands recorded a drop of 8% and 21%, respectively, in deforestation in 2022. However, last year's deforestation was the second highest in 10 years in federal protected areas and the fourth highest in the decade in indigenous areas.

2022-11-11,Amazon sets deforestation record for the month of October,180,"Once again this year, the Amazon has registered record increases in deforestation. The National Institute for Space Research (Inpe) announced on Friday (11/11) that the accumulation of deforestation alerts in October 2022 in the Legal Amazon was 904 km² - the number represents a record for the month in the historical series that began in 2015. The announcement comes amid the 27th United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP27). The alerts were made by the Real-Time Deforestation Detection System (Deter), which produces daily signals of changes in forest cover for areas larger than three hectares (0.03 km²) - both for fully deforested areas and for those undergoing forest degradation processes, such as logging, mining, burning and others. Carbon emissions The Deter system is not the official deforestation data, but it alerts us to where the problem is occurring. The official measurement of deforestation, made by the Prodes system, usually exceeds the alerts signaled by the Deter. In the evaluation of environmentalist Charles Dayler Silva de Almeida, the numbers released today are alarming. ""It is a worrisome fact because when the numbers of deforestation and fires in the Amazon reach a record high, consequently we have high carbon emissions. And the other biomes are suffering from the same problem, the Cerrado is one of them."" Almeida reiterates that now the government must study a way to try to curb the deforestation of the Amazon forest. ""This scenario, this situation of another record deforestation is very bad because Brazil runs a great risk of not being able to meet the goals (Paris agreement). Just the maintenance of the current scenario already exceeds and makes this compliance unfeasible."" Pará was the state with the largest area under deforestation alert: 435 km². Next came Mato Grosso (150 km²), Amazonas (142 km²), Rondônia (69 km²), Acre (64 km²), Roraima (24 km²), Maranhão (18 km²) and Amapá (2 km²).

2023-01-11,"Amid Brazil uprising, indigenous Amazon bucks rising CO2 trend",181,"Indigenous lands in Brazil’s Amazon rainforest absorb far more climate changing gases than they emit, in stark contrast to non-indigenous areas where substantial forest loss means Amazon land is fuelling global emissions, researchers say. Brazil’s indigenous-held forests — which make up more than a quarter of its Amazon region — removed about four times more carbon dioxide (CO2) and other gases than they emitted between 2001 and 2021, according to the World Resources Institute (WRI). The findings come as newly sworn-in leftist President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has named tackling deforestation as a top priority, after it increased by roughly 60% under the four-year tenure of his far-right predecessor Jair Bolsonaro. On Sunday, tens of thousands of anti-democratic demonstrators, who have refused to accept Bolsonaro’s October electoral defeat, invaded the Supreme Court, Congress and the presidential palace, seeking to return the former president to power. The uprising, which echoed a 2021 attack on the US Congress by supporters of defeated president Donald Trump, was ultimately dispersed, with Lula promising to punish those involved. In Brazil, Amazon forests are being lost to deforestation and degradation from expansion of farming, mining and other activities, particularly outside indigenous lands, WRI said. Indigenous parts of Brazil’s Amazon forest removed 172mn tonnes of greenhouse gases per year more than they emitted, the US-based think tank found, while non-indigenous areas released 375 million tonnes more than they absorbed. “To our great surprise, if you look at the Amazonian land outside of indigenous lands, they are collectively a source (of emissions) now,” Peter Veit, director of WRI’s Land and Resource Rights initiative, said in an interview. Scientists have warned that the Amazon is edging closer to a tipping point of drying and transformation to savanna from which it might never recover. Lula has promised to halt that trend — a reversal of Bolsonaro’s push for mining and farming expansion in the Amazon. “There is no climate security for the world without a protected Amazon,” he said in a speech at the UN COP27 climate summit in November. Among his first decisions as president, Lula restored the authority of the government’s environmental protection agency Ibama to combat illegal deforestation, and unfroze a billion-dollar fund for sustainability projects in the Amazon. WRI said detailed mapping made it possible for the first time to estimate and compare carbon emissions and sequestration between indigenous and non-indigenous areas in the Amazon. David Gibbs, a WRI research associate, said that while indigenous-held forests are not more efficient at absorbing CO2 from the atmosphere, the communities in those areas are “really making the difference in reducing emissions from deforestation”. Amazon forests managed by indigenous people in all nine countries that make up the Amazon region removed 340mn tonnes of greenhouse gases per year more than they emitted — the equivalent to the United Kingdom’s annual emissions from fossil fuels, WRI said. Txai Suruí, an indigenous youth leader from the Amazonian state of Rondônia, said that protected areas of the rainforest populated by indigenous communities were far better conserved. Her community strengthened its own monitoring efforts to protect its territories during Bolsonaro’s administration, as the community suffered attacks and was neglected by state agencies, she said. Areas not under indigenous protection did not have such monitoring help, she said. Luana Kumaruara, who lives in the Amazonian state of Pará in an area not officially recognised as indigenous but claimed by her Kumaruara people, said they had conserved the land through “self-demarcation of the territory”. “Our indigenous areas are not impacted by agribusiness, deforestation and fires because protecting Mother Earth is part of our upbringing. We don’t use (land) as business or capital.” However, Veit warned that if the collapse of the Amazon ecosystem is to be avoided, deforestation rates must be curbed on non-indigenous land as well in the next few years. “Indigenous people themselves cannot be the saviours of the Amazon alone,” he said. Scientists believe if 20-25% of the original Amazon forest canopy is lost, the region could transition away from being a rainforest, leading to the extinction of thousands of species, and releasing a enormous quantity of CO2 into the atmosphere. A 2021 report into the state of the Amazon basin by more than 200 scientists estimated about 17% of the forest canopy has been lost so far. Tarcísio Feitosa, a prominent environmental activist, said recognising more land as indigenous is a key way to boost forest protection, not just because of communities’ efforts but because it puts more legal barriers in the path of those deforesting land.

2023-01-05,Analysis: Geraldo Alckmin and Marina Silva complete the Esplanade,182,"Vice President Geraldo Alckmin, for Development, Industry, Commerce and Services, and Representative Marina Silva, for the Environment, yesterday held the most attended inauguration ceremonies of the Esplanade, with speeches that point to two priorities, among others: the reindustrialization of the country, which has lost industrial complexity, and the fight against deforestation, a real Columbus egg from the environmental point of view. Both sectors are among the most damaged by the Bolsonaro government's economic policy. Alongside President Lula, Alckmin made a long speech about the situation of the country's productive structure and emphasized that ""reindustrialization is essential to the resumption of sustainable development and that this resumption occurs under the only prism that legitimizes it: that of social justice. For Alckmin, the re-creation of the ministry was necessary ""to rebuild the country and resume the path of development. The novelty in Alckmin's proposal, however, is to make the industrial recovery compatible with the green economy, so that Brazil can be a ""major player in the process of decarbonization of the global economy"" and can integrate the global value chains with investments in innovation and new technologies in the areas where it can be competitive. Although the speech does not please liberal sectors, who see industrial policy as an undue form of state intervention in the economy, Alckmin is right when he says that Brazil cannot do without its industry if it has ambitions to leverage economic growth and develop socially. ""Either the country resumes the industrial development agenda, or it will not recover the path of sustainable growth that generates jobs,"" he said. Alckmin's role will be decisive, also, from the political point of view, because the vice-president of the Republic has always had good relations with the business community, especially in São Paulo. In a certain way, his speech sought a point of balance between the government's economic policy and the market. There is a lot of speculation in the financial market regarding the economic policy of the Lula government and the misalignment between ministers, which generates more confusion, such as the clumsy declarations of the Minister of Social Security, Carlos Lupi, regarding the Social Security reform. Alckmin will be a key player in articulating the Lula government's economic team, which includes Simone Tebet, in Planning, and Carlos Fávaro (PR), in Agriculture, by acting as cotton between the crystals, so that the policy to be adopted by the Minister of Finance, Fernando Haddad, has complementarity in the other portfolios. Deforestation Another star to take office was Marina, who took over the Ministry of the Environment with the purpose of achieving zero deforestation. The impact this could have internationally is formidable, because it strongly reduces the rate of global warming. It is a real Columbus' egg. There is reason for optimism. With the exception of the last four years, no other country has reduced its carbon emissions as much as Brazil. Our differential is our sovereignty over 60% of the largest tropical forest in the world, the Amazon. About 44% of our greenhouse gas emissions come from land use change, that is, deforestation, mainly in the Amazon Region. It is much easier and cheaper - and, therefore, more efficient - to combat deforestation than to make wholesale changes to energy systems, transportation, construction standards, and food production, although this should happen. Brazil has the expertise for this: between 2004 and 2012, it reduced deforestation in the Amazon by 84% and, consequently, its emissions by 67%. The change of course in the ministry, if there is cooperation and interdisciplinary coordination with other portfolios, as announced by Marina Marina, may well make deforestation negligible and find other ways to meet the needs of 38 million Brazilians in the Amazon, about 12% of the population, in generally precarious conditions, who desire and deserve a more prosperous life. There is no point in isolating and treating the forest as an untouched park. It is politically unfeasible and ineffective. The key is to combine environmental control with repression of illegalities and initiatives that make the standing forest more valuable to the local population than cutting it down, as Marina proposed. With the Lula government, having Marina as head of the portfolio, the possibility of a new forest economy opens up, generating products and technology. The potential for pharmacological and chemical discoveries from biodiversity is also enormous and can replace low-productivity cattle farming and illegal mining. Vice President Geraldo Alckmin, for Development, Industry, Commerce and Services, and Representative Marina Silva, for Environment, were the protagonists yesterday of the most crowded inauguration ceremonies of the Esplanade, with speeches that point to two priorities, among others: the reindustrialization of the country, which has lost industrial complexity, and the combat against deforestation, a real Columbus' egg from the environmental point of view.

2023-02-10,"Biden and Lula meet with focus on democracy, climate change and Ukraine",183,"Washington, Feb. 10 - U.S. President Joe Biden and his Brazilian counterpart, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, will meet this Friday at the White House with the focus on the promotion of democracy, the fight against climate change and the war in Ukraine. A high-ranking U.S. official gave to the press some details of the official agenda of the meeting, scheduled for 15.50 local time (20.50 GMT). It will be the first face-to-face between Biden and Lula as presidents of their respective countries, although they know each other from when the American was vice president with Barack Obama (2009-2017). They first met in 2009 on a trip Biden made to Chile, the official detailed. Biden, who believes that a good foreign policy is based on communication with other leaders, wants to develop a ""personal bond"" with Lula to make clear to him the importance that the relationship with Brazil has for his government, said the cited source. Specifically, the two presidents will talk about how to strengthen their trade relations, while respecting workers' rights and promoting the fight against climate change with special attention to the Amazon, the official added. One of the unknowns is whether Biden will use the visit with Lula to announce what would be the first U.S. contribution to the Amazon Fund, which was created in 2009 to help combat Amazon deforestation and was financed mainly with contributions from Norway and Germany. Norway and Germany froze their contributions to that fund with the advance of Amazon deforestation under the government of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro (2019-2023); but have expressed their desire to resume them already with Lula in power. Beyond the Amazon, the other major theme of the meeting will be the defense of democracy, especially after Bolsonaro's supporters stormed the headquarters of the three branches of government in Brasilia on January 8. A similar event took place in the United States on January 6, 2021, when supporters of the then president, Donald Trump (2017-2021), forced their way into the Capitol. According to the aforementioned official, the two leaders will talk about democracy in their own countries, but will also talk more broadly about initiatives to strengthen it regionally and around the world, including the so-called ""Democracy Summit"" that Biden has promoted and that will be held in March this year. Lula and Biden will also discuss the war in Ukraine, the issue on which they have the most differences, since the Brazilian has not explicitly condemned the Russian invasion and has suggested that Ukraine also bears ""part of the responsibility"". The Brazilian president has also advocated dialogue and at the end of January proposed the creation of a group - made up of the United States, Germany, France, Brazil, India and China, among others - to mediate in the conflict. In addition to meeting with Biden, Lula is scheduled to meet today with the leftist Senator Bernie Sanders, and with representatives of the largest trade union federation in the United States, the AFL-CIO.

2022-10-17,Bolsonaro or Lula: in which government was the deforestation rate in the Amazon higher?,184,"One of the themes to be highlighted during the first debate of the second round of the 2022 elections was the deforestation of the Amazon. In the second block, former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (PT) said that the current government is ""playing at deforestation, at 'opening fences,' at cutting down trees. ""We will win the elections to be able to take care of the Amazon and not allow there to be invasion of indigenous land and illegal mining."" President Jair Bolsonaro (PL), running for re-election, hit back and asked viewers to do an internet search.  Link to Image Link to Image Deforestation rate in the Amazon has increased in recent years, federal government statistics reveal - Getty Images via BBC News Brazil  ""Give a Google: 'deforestation from 2003 to 2006', in the four years of Lula's government. Then search 'deforestation from 2019 to 2022,'"" he said. Looking at Lula, Bolsonaro added: ""During his government, twice as much was deforested as during mine. Link to Image Link to Image During the debate, Lula and Bolsonaro used most of the time to talk about pandemics, fake news, and corruption - Reproduction/TV Bandeirantes  But what do the data say? In fact, the total area of forest destroyed during the first three years of the Lula administration was higher compared to the same period of Bolsonaro in office - but the deforestation rate was significantly reduced and reached historic lows between 2006 and 2015, especially during the period in which Dilma Rousseff (PT) assumed the presidency. To get an idea, the area deforested per year fell almost five times between 2003 and 2015. In contrast, the numbers have risen again more recently, with a new acceleration of deforestation between the governments of Michel Temer (MDB) and Bolsonaro. Between 2016 and 2021, the area destroyed each year almost doubled. Check out what the figures on deforestation in the Amazon show below.  Brake and accelerator The official information about the destruction of areas of the Amazon Forest comes from the Prodes Project, which is conducted by the National Institute for Space Research (INPE), linked to the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovations. The agency has been monitoring the forest by satellites since 1988 and the data obtained serve as a basis for the government to update public policies related to the region and environmental preservation. In absolute numbers, it is possible to see that the area deforested in the Amazon in 2003, the first year of the Lula administration, was 25.3 thousand square kilometers. In the following year, the destroyed area grew to 27.7 thousand square kilometers. As of 2005, however, there was a drop in these rates. There were 19 thousand km² that year, followed by 14.2 thousand (2006), 11.6 thousand (2007), 12.9 thousand (2008), 7.4 thousand (2009) and 7 thousand (2010). Link to Image Link to Image Via BBC News Brazil  That is: during the two mandates of the President of Brazil, the deforestation rate fell 67% .  The numbers continued to decline during Dilma Rousseff's government: the year with the least deforestation in the Amazon in the historical series was 2012, when 4.5 thousand km² were devastated. Since then, the area destroyed has only expanded: with the exception of 2014 and 2017, all recent years have recorded an increase in Inpe's rates. And what specifically has happened since Bolsonaro took office? In the first year of the current government, in 2019, the deforested area was 10,100 km². The rates continued to rise in 2020 (10.8 thousand km²) and in 2021 (13 thousand km²). The data for 2022 are not yet available. In other words: the deforestation rate rose 73% in the first three years of Bolsonaro's administration. Link to Image Link to Image Via BBC News Brazil  Another pondering made by environmentalists involves the legacy that each president received from the previous government .  Deforestation in 2002, when the president was still Fernando Henrique Cardoso (PSDB), was 21.6 thousand km². In 2018, the last year of Michel Temer (MDB) as president, 7,500 km² of forest were destroyed - a proportion three times lower.  Link to Image Link to Image Via BBC News Brazil What about the other biomes? Inpe has also been doing similar monitoring in the Cerrado since 2001. The movement of the graphs is very similar to what happened in the Amazon: growth in the absolute area deforested during the first two years of the Lula administration (28.8 thousand km2 in 2003, a number that was repeated in 2004) and a sustained decline between 2005 (16.9 thousand) and 2012 (9 thousand). The rate of deforestation in this biome rose again in 2013 (13.5 thousand), but showed a new decrease between 2014 (10.9 thousand) and 2019 (6.3 thousand). In 2020 and 2021, deforestation in the Cerrado rose again and reached 7.9 thousand and 8.5 thousand km², respectively. As for the Atlantic Forest, 21.6 thousand hectares (ha) were deforested between 2020 and 2021, an increase of 66% compared to 2019 and 2020 (13 thousand ha) and 90% between 2017 and 2018 (11.3 thousand ha), when the lowest value of the historical series was reached. The data were compiled by the NGO SOS Mata Atlântica. Finally, MapBiomas reveals a similar situation in the Pantanal. The devastated area rose from 24.3 thousand ha in 2018 to 31.7 thousand in 2019 and 42.8 thousand in 2020. The lowest rate of destruction of this biome was recorded in 2015, when 23 thousand ha were deforested. This text was originally published here."
2023-03-16,"Bolsonaro to give lecture on environment in the US, one day after he was due to return to Brazil",185,"After having said last Monday (16) that hewould return to Brazil on March 29,former president Jair Bolsonaro (PL) has been confirmed at a seminar on environment and sustainability that takes place the following day (30) in Florida, in the United States. The seminar organized by Geoflorestas, a São Paulo-based environmental consultancy, will take place at a private Christian college located in the city of Deerfield Beach. ""Come participate in the seminar on Environment and Sustainability with the participation of former president Jair Bolsonaro,"" says an invitation to the event. Throughout his term in office, Bolsonaro has been criticized for his actions related to the environment, especially in relation to the Amazon Rainforest. His management of the area was marked by a sharp increase in deforestation rates and measures that loosened enforcement on environmental crimes. In the last 12 months that former minister Ricardo Salles held the portfolio, Brazil had more than 13 thousand km² of deforestation in the Amazon, the worst rate in 15 years. Salles was removed from his post in June 2021, when he became the target of a Federal Police (PF) investigation for suspected illegal timber exports to the United States and Europe. In Florida since last December, the former president said in a meeting with Brazilian businessmen that he should return to the country one day before the new appointment. ""I always set a date to return. The date set now is the 29th of this month. Seven days before we study the situation: how is Brazil, how are the contacts here"", Bolsonaro clarified to the supporters. In the next few days, the former Chief Executive will also participate in a university event. On March 22, Bolsonaro will be at a business and leadership symposium.

2022-11-30,"Brazil: Amazon deforestation drops, but devastation still rampant",186,"Nov 30, 2022( Al Jazeera English: https://www.aljazeera.com/ Delivered by Newstex)   Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon has fallen in the 12 months through July, new government data showed, as incoming President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva seeks to restore protection[1] for the vital rainforest.  National space agency (INPE) data released on Wednesday showed 11,568sq km (4,466sq miles) of forest cover was destroyed in the Brazilian Amazon from August 2021 to July 2022 - an area larger than Qatar.  That was an 11 percent drop from the same period a year earlier, when deforestation hit a 15-year high[2] under far-right Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro.  'It's better to have a lower number than a higher number, but it's still a very high number - the second highest in 13 years,' said Marcio Astrini, head of the Climate Observatory, an environmental advocacy group.  Wednesday's data closed out four years of what environmentalists call disastrous management[3] of the Amazon under Bolsonaro, who was accused of weakening environmental and Indigenous protection agencies in favour of agri-business and mining interests[4].  Under the former army captain, average annual deforestation rose by 59.5 percent from the previous four years, and by 75.5 percent from the previous decade, according to INPE figures.  'The Bolsonaro government was a forest-destroying machine The only good news is that it's about to end,' Astrini said in a statement. 'The devastation remains out of control. Jair Bolsonaro[5] will hand his successor a filthy legacy of surging deforestation and an Amazon in flames.'  Lula, a left-wing leader who won tightly fought elections[6] last month, has promised to work towards zero deforestation when he takes office on January 1.  'Brazil is ready to resume its leading role in the fight against the climate crisis,' he said shortly after being declared the winner of the October 30 presidential run-off.  Lula, who previously served as Brazil's president from 2003 to 2010, also attended the COP27 climate summit[7] in Egypt earlier this month, where he told hundreds in attendance that 'Brazil is back in the world'.  Brazilian Senator-elect Flavio Dino, who is acting as public security chief in Lula's transition team, told the Reuters news agency on Wednesday that the incoming administration would create a new federal police unit focused on environmental crimes.  Dino said the proposed unit would take a broad view of crimes in the Amazon[8], where deforestation, illegal mining, drug trafficking, money laundering and gang violence are often interlinked.  'There is now a specific complexity of environmental crimes[9], in which there is, a kind of combo of crimes in the Amazon. We no longer have isolated environmental crimes,' he told the news agency.  'You have this sophistication and there is a transnationality, because it involves other countries in the Amazon. So the idea is a specialised unit for greater efficiency and greater articulation with neighbouring countries.'  Under Bolsonaro, Indigenous leaders had raised alarm about the threats their communities face[10] in the Brazilian Amazon, especially in areas with little government oversight that farmers, miners and poachers are seeking to control and exploit.  The Indigenous Missionary Council recorded 305 cases of 'invasions, illegal exploitation[11] of resources and damage to property' on Indigenous territories last year that affected 226 Indigenous lands in 22 Brazilian states.  That was up from 109 such incidents in 2018, the year before Bolsonaro took office - a 180 percent increase.  Carbon Brief, a UK-based climate website, said in a report in September that a Lula election victory could see deforestation drop by 89 percent in the Brazilian Amazon over the next decade and would prevent the destruction of 75,960sq km (29,328sq miles) of rainforest by 2030.  Still, Lula could face tough political opposition[4] in areas where Amazon deforestation is happening, and he also must deal with the difficulty of policing such vast, often remote areas.

2022-12-02,Brazil: Amazon Deforestation in Brazil Remains Near 15-Year High,187,"Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon slowed slightly last year, a year after setting a 15-year high, according to closely watched numbers published Wednesday. The data was released by the National Institute for Space Research. The agency's Prodes monitoring system shows the rainforest lost an area roughly the size of Qatar, about 11,600 square kilometers in the 12 months from August 2021 to July 2022. That is down 11% compared with the previous year, when more than 13,000 square kilometers were destroyed. For more than a decade deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon declined dramatically and never rose back above 10,000 square kilometers. Then came the presidency of far-right President Jair Bolsonaro, beginning in January 2019. This will be the last report published under Bolsonaro, who lost his reelection bid and will leave office January 1. But part of the destruction that took place on his watch will not appear until next year, including the key months from August to October 2022. A because it is the dry season. An analysis of the new yearly data from Climate Observatory, a network of environmental groups, shows that in the four years of Bolsonaro's leadership, deforestation rose 60% over the previous four years. That is the largest percentage rise under a presidency since satellite monitoring began in 1998. In one state, Para, a fierce rate of destruction fell by 21% yet it was still the center of one-third of all Brazil's Amazon forest loss. Part of the tree cutting and burning happens in areas that are ostensibly protected. One such area is Paru State Forest, where the nonprofit Amazon Institute of People and the Environment registered 2 square kilometers of deforestation in just October. ""In recent years, deforestation has reached protected areas where previously there was almost no destruction,"" Jacqueline Pereira, a researcher with the Amazon Institute, told The Associated Press. ""In Paru's region, the destruction is driven by lease of land for soybean crops and cattle."" Another critical area is the southern part of the state of Amazonas, the only state that increased deforestation in the most recent data, by 13% compared to the year before. It's largely attributable to Bolsonaro's push to pave about 400 kilometers of the only road that connects Manaus, home to 2.2 million people, with Brazil's larger urban centers further south. Most Amazon deforestation occurs alongside roads where access is easier and land value is higher. Researchers and environmentalists have blamed Bolsonaro's policies for the surge in deforestation. The administration weakened environmental agencies and backed legislative measures to loosen land protections in the name of economic development, paired with a view of occupying a sparsely populated territory at any cost. This policy has emboldened land robbers and spurred more illegal mining. Bolsonaro's successor, leftist former President Luiz In\xE1cio Lula da Silva, promised cheering crowds at the recent U.N. climate conference in Egypt to end all deforestation in the country by 2030. ""There will be no climate security if the Amazon isn't protected,"" he said. The last time da Silva was president, from 2003 to 2010, deforestation fell sharply. On the other hand, he backed initiatives that set in motion destruction in the long run, such as the construction of the mammoth Belo Monte hydroelectric dam and generous loans to the beef industry. Chopping down forest for pasture is the primary driver of deforestation. The Amazon rainforest, which covers an area twice the size of India, acts as a buffer against climate change by absorbing large amounts of carbon dioxide. It's also the most biodiverse forest in the world, and the home of tribes that have lived in the forest for thousands of years, some of them living in isolation. ""If da Silva wants to decrease forest destruction by 2023, he must have zero tolerance for environmental crime from Day One of his administration. That includes holding accountable those who sabotaged environmental governance in the country while in office over the past four years,"" said Marcio Astrini, executive secretary of the Climate Observatory. - VOA"
2022-11-11,Brazil: Amazon deforestation reaches new high before gov't change,188,"Nov 11, 2022( Al Jazeera English: https://www.aljazeera.com/ Delivered by Newstex)   Deforestation in Brazil's Amazon[1] has hit a new, alarming milestone, government data showed, as environmentalists warn that a 'frantic race towards devastation' is under way before a government transition that is expected to usher in more protection for the rainforest.  Preliminary government satellite data collected by space research agency Inpe and released on Friday showed that approximately 904sq km (349sq miles) were cleared in the region[2] in October, the highest for the month since tracking began in 2015.  From January to October, 9,494sq km (3,666sq miles) were cleared, equal to an area more than 12 times the size of New York City and also a record for the period, exceeding the previous high set in 2019 by 12.7 percent.  Incoming Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who is set to take office on January 1, has promised to bolster environmental safeguards[3] and funding for state agencies tasked with protecting the Amazon.  The rainforest, which is critical to the global fight against climate change, has seen years of increased deforestation under the administration of Lula's predecessor, outgoing President Jair Bolsonaro[4].  The far-right former army captain had pushed for more mining and other development projects[1] in the Amazon, saying they would stimulate the economy.  But rights groups accused Bolsonaro of gutting Brazil's environmental and Indigenous protection agencies, leading to an uptick in deforestation[5] and violence across the sprawling region.  Annual statistics released last year showed deforestation had already surged to a 15-year high[6] under Bolsonaro. His office and the Ministry of the Environment did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the Reuters news agency on Friday.  For his part, Lula, in a victory speech after narrowly defeating Bolsonaro[7] in an October 30 run-off, said Brazil was 'ready to resume its leading role in the fight against the climate crisis', especially by protecting the Amazon.  He also has pledged to 'fight for zero deforestation'.  Lula, who previously served as Brazil's president from 2003 to 2010, will travel to Egypt next week to take part in the COP27 global climate summit[8] and meet international leaders.  'I will travel to Egypt on Monday. I will have more conversations with world leaders in a single day than Bolsonaro[9] did in four years,' Lula said on Thursday during a meeting with legislators in the Brazilian capital, Brasilia.  Rights groups are urging Lula to bolster agencies tasked with protecting the Amazon [File: Bruno Kelly/Reuters]  The Workers' Party leader[10] did not specify who he would meet with, but said he planned to reposition Brazil at the centre of international geopolitics.  Meanwhile, the Brazilian branch of the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) said on Friday that the increase in Amazon deforestation in October was expected, 'but the preliminary data for the first days of November is terrifying.'  'It's a true, frantic race towards devastation' before the change in government, WWF-Brasil said.  'The new government will have a lot of work to do to put the country back on track, to put an end to the perception that the Amazon is a lawless land,' WWF-Brasil's Raul do Valle said in a statement.

2022-12-02,Brazil : Annual deforestation in the Amazon has reduced by 11.27%,189,"Deforestation in the Legal Brazilian Amazon (ALB) fell 11.27% in the period from August 1, 2021 to July 31, 2022 compared to the previous year, according to consolidated numbers from PRODES. The estimated area of ??deforestation in the period was 11,568 km for the nine states of the ALB, a reduction of 1,470 km in relation to PRODES 2020/2021, which was 13,038 km. PRODES considers deforestation to be the complete removal of the primary forest cover by clear cutting or the final stage of a progressive degradation of the forest in which there is loss of the canopy, regardless of the future use of these areas. Deforested areas larger than 6.25 hectares are registered and quantified. Eight of the nine states that make up the ALB registered a reduction in deforestation. Amap was the federation unit that most reduced forest loss, with a 64% reduction. Tocantins, Roraima, Par and Maranho come next with reductions of 27.03%, 23.81%, 20.94% and 19.43%, respectively. Rondnia and Acre recorded 9.62% and 4.72% decreases in deforestation, respectively. Amazonas was the only state with an increase in forest loss (13.05%). COMBATING ENVIRONMENTAL ILLEGAL More than a dozen federal agencies act in concert to combat illegal deforestation, burnings, forest fires and to protect indigenous lands and conservation units, with institutional articulation by the Civil House of the Presidency of the Republic. Operation Guardians of the Biome, one of the initiatives of the Federal Government in the fight against environmental crimes, operates in 15 states, reaching the Amazon, Cerrado, Pantanal, Atlantic Forest and Caatinga biomes. The first phase of the Operation, which took place in 2021, reduced 24% of the areas burned during the worst drought in the last 100 years. The operation rescued 1,580 animals, seized 5,848 m3 of wood, 137 machinery and imposed 1,607 fines. Six operational bases were installed in strategic locations in Par, Amazonas and Rondnia, with a consequent reduction of 21.42% in the aggregate area of ??deforestation in 10 municipalities. Operation Guardians of the Biome also combats illegal mining and other environmental offenses in the Yanomami Indigenous Land, in Roraima, where 53.7 tons of minerals were seized and 37 people were arrested. 162 aircraft used in environmental crimes were also withdrawn from circulation. At each Operation base, helicopters allow teams to act more quickly, through qualified deforestation alerts, produced by the Management and Operational Center of the Amazon Protection System. All PRODES data are available on the TerraBrasilis platform . Technical details can be accessed in the Technical Note published on the website of the National Institute for Space Research (INPE)."
2022-10-07,Brazil: Deforestation of Amazon hit record high in run-up to election,190,"Oct 07, 2022( Deutsche Welle World: http://www.dw.de/top-stories/world/s-1429 Delivered by Newstex)   New figures have highlighted the devastation caused by President Bolsonaro's attacks on environmental rights. Brazil's presidential vote could determine the fate of the Amazon rainforest.Deforestation in Brazil's Amazon rainforest — the largest in the world — hit a year-on-year record in September as far-right President Jair Bolsonaro was preparing to face off against his popular leftist rival in the recent presidential election.  Brazilian space research agency INPE reported on Friday that 1,455 square kilometers (562 square miles) of the forest were cleared last month.  This represents an increase of 48% on September 2021 and surpasses the previous record for the level of deforestation in the month of September set in 2019.  From January to September a total of 8,590 square kilometers of the Amazon was cleared — equivalent to an area 11 times the size of New York City.  Bolsonaro's presidency has been marked by increased destruction of the rainforest as well as increased attacks on Indigenous people living in the Amazon region.  Environmental protections at stake in vote  Fires are common in the Amazon in August and September as rains subside and ranchers and farmers burn off parts of the land that have been cleared of rainforest.  INPE recorded the highest number of fire alerts in September this year since September 2010.  Experts have pointed to the rolling back of environmental protections by Bolsonaro that have allowed illegal clearings to increase.  The accelerating deforestation became clear after the far-right lawmaker took power. The loss of the Amazon not only plays a significant role in global climate change but also means a loss of biodiversity in one of the world's richest biomes.  The forest clearances have ""pretty relevant impacts not only for the biome, but also for the weather and the region's rainfall regime, as well as economic impacts for those who live in the Amazon and Brazil as a whole,"" Mariana Napolitano, WWF-Brasil's science manager said.  The president is now headed to a runoff vote against former President Luiz Ignacio Lula da Silva following an inconclusive first round of voting on October 2.  Lula has pledged to strengthen environmental protections if he wins.  ab/sms (Reuters, dpa AFP)  Notes The views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the ""Newstex Authoritative Content"") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

2022-10-31,Brazil: Lula pledges to end deforestation in the Amazon after election victory,191,"Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva pledged to end deforestation in Amazon after winning Brazil’s election on Sunday. Celebrating his victory over far-right incumbent Jair Bolsanaro, Lula promised bolder environmental action in the next four years. “Let’s fight for zero deforestation,” he said in his victory speech. “Brazil is ready to resume its leading role in the fight against the climate crisis, protecting all our biomes, especially the Amazon rainforest.” “Brazil will fight for a living Amazon; a standing tree is worth more than thousands of logs - that is why we will resume the surveillance of the entire Amazon and any illegal activity, and at the same time we will promote sustainable development.” How have world leaders reacted to Lula’s election win? In congratulating Lula on his victory, a number of world leaders welcomed his green commitments. “I look forward to working together on the issues that matter to the UK and Brazil, from growing the global economy to protecting the planet’s natural resources and promoting democratic values,” UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak wrote on Twitter. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said she looked “forward to working with [Lula] to address pressing global challenges, from food security to trade and climate change.” The change in approach to environmental policies could also unlock negotiations on a trade deal between the EU and Mercosur - a South American trade bloc that includes Brazil. It was officially finalised in 2019 but has been held back by concerns from Europe - particularly French President Emmanual Macron - about the Amazon rainforest. “Together, we will join forces to take up our many common challenges and rebuild the bond of friendship between our two countries,” Macron tweeted following Lula’s victory. Norway to resume aid for the protection of the Amazon On Monday, Norway announced that it would resume subsidies for the protection of the Amazon rainforest. “We had a good and very close collaboration with the government before Bolsonaro and deforestation in Brazil declined greatly under Lula da Silva's (previous) presidency,” Environment Minister Espen Barthe Edie told AFP. Norway was one of the biggest donors to funds for the protection of Brazil’s rainforest. But deforestation has risen dramatically to a level Barth Edie describes as “scandalous”. The country halted its aid in 2019 when Bolsonaro took power. Barth Edie added that around five billion Norwegian krone (€485 million) of unused aid was waiting to be distributed by the Amazon Fund for Forest Conservation and Climate Protection. Now, the country is keen to make contact with Lula’s team as quickly as possible to “prepare for a resumption of the historically good collaboration between Brazil and Norway.” Can Lula bring an end to deforestation in the Amazon? Lula’s victory could cut deforestation in the Amazon by 89 per cent over the next decade, according to an analysis carried out by Carbon Brief. But environmentalists are holding their breath as Lula is left with the massive challenge of reversing Bolsonaro’s damaging policies. Co-founder of NGO the Environmental Justice Foundation Steve Trent says Bolsonaro leaves behind a legacy of weakened environmental legislation, defunded environmental agencies and record levels of deforestation.  Steve Trent Co-founder, Environmental Justice Foundation  The re-election of Lula, he adds, means “people and nature have a chance to recover after the wanton destruction of the Bolsonaro years.” “However, he will need all the support he can get to steer Brazil back towards becoming a global environmental leader.” Lula now faces a “mammoth” challenge to reverse the “intentional environmental and human rights catastrophes” of the previous Brazilian president, Trent says."
2022-11-15,Brazil's incoming government presses for data on Amazon's deforestation,192,"BUENOS AIRES Brazil's vice president-elect called Monday for the current administration to provide data on deforestation levels in the Amazon. Geraldo Alckmin, who is handling the transition between the administration of incoming President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and outgoing President Jair Bolsonaro's government, announced that he had requested the full reports on the Amazon rainforest's deforestation for the last year. ""We requested that the complete reports of the data from Prodes Amazonia and Prodes Cerrado from the period of August 2021 to July 2022 be sent so that we can analyze the information they contain and take the necessary measures,"" said Alckmin. Prodes is a satellite system used by Brazil's National Institute for Space Research (INPE) to observe and record deforestation in the Amazon region. Alckmin, speaking in Brazil's financial capital Sao Paulo, add that the ""numbers already exist"" and underscored ""the need to be informed"" regarding deforestation levels in the Amazon. Alckmin's request was made on the same day that Lula left to participate in the UN climate change conference COP27, which is underway in Egypt's resort city of Sharm el Sheikh. COP27 will be the president-elect's first official visit since beating Bolsonaro in the second-round presidential runoff at the end of October. On Monday, Lula, who has been pushing to re-establish Brazil's presence on the world stage and to clamp down on Amazon deforestation, wrote on Twitter that ""we are returning to the world,"" with an emoji of a Brazilian flag and a globe of the world. On Wednesday at COP27, he is expected to outline his push to tackle deforestation in the Amazon region to world leaders. Last year, Bolsonaro's administration waited until the end of COP26 to release a report that revealed the worst Amazon deforestation in 15 years. The data was reportedly ready before COP26 began."
2023-01-11,Brazil makes official bid for Amazonian city to host COP30,193,"SAO PAULO: Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said on Wednesday he had officially launched a bid for the northeastern city of Belem to host the COP30 international climate summit in 2025, fulfilling a promise he made last year. Lula, who in November attended the COP27 in Egypt as president-elect pledging to recommit the rainforest nation to tackling the climate crisis, said at the time he would name a city in the Amazon to host the 2025 U.N. climate talks. Belem is the capital of the Amazonian state of Para and one of the largest cities in the region by population, second only to Manaus, which hosted games of the 2014 World Cup. Lula said in a video on Twitter that Brazil's foreign relations ministry had formalized Belem as a candidate to host COP30. ""In Egypt I made the pledge that Brazil could host COP30, and I am happy to know that our (foreign relations) minister Mauro Vieira has formalized Belem's bid,"" Lula said in the video alongside Para Governor Helder Barbalho. Lula has been promising to tackle deforestation in the Amazon, which hit a 15-year-high under former President Jair Bolsonaro. He recently named Marina Silva, who oversaw a significant drop in deforestation during his first stint as president in the 2000s, as his environment minister.

2022-11-11,Brazil records worst October in Amazon deforestation since 2015,194,"Almost 1,000 square kilometers of the Brazilian Amazon were lost in October, the worst figure for this month since records became available in 2015, according to official data released on Friday (11), less than two months before the end of President Jair Bolsonaro's term. The deforested area, of 904 km², last month in the largest tropical forest on the planet is 3% greater than that of October 2021, a former record for the month, according to data from the satellite surveillance system DETER, of the National Institute for Space Research (INPE). The NGO WWF-Brazil warned that along with the increase in deforestation, the number of fires ""increased"" after the presidential elections. ""The increase in deforestation and wildfire alerts was expected - yet the numbers for the first 10 days of November are frightening clearly shows an unbridled race for devastation in some states,"" the NGO said in a statement. During the administration of Bolsonaro, a climate change denier, the average annual deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon - caused mainly by the felling of trees for the expansion of cattle pastures and the agricultural frontier, according to experts - increased by 75 percent over the previous decade. The Brazilian Amazon corresponds to 59% of the Brazilian territory, distributed in nine states. More than half of the destroyed area was concentrated in the state of Pará (north), with 435 km² cut down. The accumulated deforestation between January 1 and October 31 this year represents the highest value in the DETER system's historical series, WWF-Brazil pointed out, with the destruction of 9,494 km². President-elect Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva promised ""a living Amazon,"" reactivating policies to protect the forest and combat deforestation, differentiating himself from the far-right president. ""The new government will have a lot of work to put the country back on track, to end this perception that the Amazon is a lawless land,"" Raul do Valle, a public policy specialist with the NGO WWF-Brazil said in a statement. Lula will travel to Egypt next Monday, invited by Egyptian President Abdel Fatah al Sisi to attend the COP27 climate conference, his international preview before taking office on January 1, 2023. The left-wing government intends to regain international prestige with an agenda focused on environmental protection."
2022-11-11,Brazil sets new Amazon deforestation record for October,195,"Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon rainforest broke the monthly record for October, with the destruction of 904 square kilometers (350 square miles), official figures showed Friday. The grim news comes less than two months before far-right President Jair Bolsonaro's four-year term ends. The former army captain is a climate change skeptic and has been heavily criticized over policies seen as encouraging deforestation. The DETER satellite observation system detected a three percent increase in the deforested area of the world's largest tropical rainforest compared to October 2021, making it a record for that month, according to the INPE space research institute. The newly deforested section stretches an area just over half the size of Sao Paulo.  With two months still to go, 2022 is already the worst year for Amazon deforestation since DETER began monitoring it in 2015. However, far higher figures of deforestation were recorded in the early 2000s. So far this year almost 9,500 square kilometers have been destroyed, compared to the total 9,200 square kilometers deforested in 2021. The Brazilian branch of the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) said deforestation and wildfires had ""exploded"" since last month's presidential election, in which Bolsonaro was defeated by leftist Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. Lula, who was also president from 2003-2010, has pledged to eliminate deforestation. ""The increase in deforestation (in October) was expected, but even so, the numbers for the first days of November are frightening, they show an unbridled race for destruction"" before the change of government on January 1, said the WWF. Under Bolsonaro, average annual deforestation increased 75 percent compared to the previous decade. Lula confirmed on Thursday he would attend the COP27 climate summit in Egypt next week. ""The new government will have its work cut out to repair the situation, to end the perception that the Amazon is a lawless land,"" said WWF specialist Raul do Valle in a statement. However, Bolsonaro's environmental policies will keep ""causing damage for some time yet,"" said Andre Freitas from Greenpeace in Brazil."
2022-10-07,Brazilian Amazon deforestation breaks September record,196,"Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon broke the monthly record for September, according to official figures released Friday, triggering calls from environmentalists to vote far-right President Jair Bolsonaro out of office later this month. In the latest worrying news on the rainforest, satellite monitoring showed 1,455 square kilometers (562 square miles) of forest cover was destroyed in the Brazilian Amazon last month, according to national space agency INPE's real-time surveillance program, DETER. The area is equivalent to 25 times the size of Manhattan, and the worst for September since the program was launched in 2015. The previous record for September was also under Bolsonaro: 1,454 square kilometers in 2019. The figures came as Bolsonaro battles to win re-election in an October 30 runoff against leftist ex-president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva (2003-2010), who has vowed to work to achieve net-zero deforestation. Lula -- who also faced criticism at times for his environmental record as president -- won Sunday's first-round election with 48 percent of the vote, to 43 percent for Bolsonaro. Bolsonaro, an ally of the powerful agribusiness sector, has faced international criticism for presiding over a surge of destruction in Brazil's 60-percent share of the world's biggest rainforest, a key buffer against global warming. Since he took office in January 2019, average annual deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon has increased by 75 percent from the previous decade. Experts say the agribusiness industry is driving the destruction by clear-cutting and burning forest to turn it to farmland and pasture. With three months to go, 2022 is already the second-worst year on record for deforestation, at 8,590 square kilometers, according to DETER. That is second only to 2019, Bolsonaro's first year in office, when 9,178 square kilometers were destroyed. The second- and third-worst years were also under Bolsonaro -- 2020 and 2021, respectively. ""Anyone who cares about the future of the rainforest, the lives of indigenous peoples and the possibility of having a livable planet should vote to remove Bolsonaro,"" Marcio Astrini, the executive secretary of the Climate Observatory, a coalition of environmental groups, said in a statement. Bolsonaro's campaign defends his record as ""balancing environmental protection with fair and sustainable economic growth."""
2022-11-30,"Brazilian Amazon deforestation falls, but up 60% under Bolsonaro",197,"Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon destroyed an area bigger than Qatar in the 12 months through July, according to official figures released Wednesday, which showed a decline from the year before -- but a sharp increase overall under outgoing President Jair Bolsonaro. In the latest grim news on the world's biggest rainforest, satellite monitoring showed 11,568 square kilometers (4,466 square miles) of forest cover was destroyed in the Brazilian Amazon from August 2021 to July 2022, according to national space agency INPE's annual deforestation tracking program, PRODES. The figure was a decrease of 11.3 percent from the year before, when INPE detected 13,038 square kilometers of deforestation -- a 15-year high. But it closed out four years of what environmentalists call disastrous management of the Amazon under the far-right Bolsonaro, whose successor, veteran leftist Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, has vowed to work toward zero deforestation when he takes office on January 1. Under agribusiness ally Bolsonaro, average annual deforestation rose by 59.5 percent from the previous four years, and by 75.5 percent from the previous decade, according to INPE figures. ""The Bolsonaro government was a forest-destroying machine... The only good news is that it's about to end,"" said Marcio Astrini, executive secretary of the Climate Observatory, a coalition of environmental groups. ""Jair Bolsonaro will hand his successor a filthy legacy of surging deforestation and an Amazon in flames,"" he said in a statement, urging Lula -- who previously led Brazil from 2003 to 2010 -- to show ""zero tolerance"" for environmental crimes. Bolsonaro's office and the environment ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Experts say the vast majority of the clear-cutting and fires erasing the Amazon are to create new farmland -- especially for cattle ranches in Brazil, the world's top beef exporter. The deforestation figures show the Amazon is being pushed toward a ""tipping point,"" warned Mariana Napolitano, science director at the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) Brazil office. ""Significantly reducing deforestation... is imperative for humankind in the face of the twin climate and nature crises the world is facing,"" she said in a statement. - All eyes on Lula - Environmentalists said the figures had been ready since November 3, and accused the government of stalling their release to avoid embarrassment at the United Nations' COP27 climate conference in Egypt. Bolsonaro, who has faced international outcry over the Amazon, did not attend the conference. Lula did, fresh off defeating Bolsonaro in a runoff election. The 77-year-old president-elect received a rock star's welcome from climate campaigners hoping Brazil will now do a far better job protecting its 60-percent share of the Amazon, whose billions of carbon-absorbing trees are a key buffer against global warming. ""Brazil is back,"" Lula told the conference, vowing to fight to end illegal deforestation and revive the internationally backed, $1.3-billion Amazon Fund to protect the rainforest -- suspended under Bolsonaro. Annual deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon fell by 75 percent during Lula's first presidency, an accomplishment many experts attribute to respected former environment minister Marina Silva -- now tipped to return to the job. But Lula also faced criticism during his previous two terms from environmentalists -- including Silva -- over some policies, such as the controversial decision to push ahead with the massive Belo Monte hydroelectric dam in the Amazon. The latest figures came the same day as a new study that found 90 percent of all land deforested in Brazil has been converted to pasture. The Amazon is the region with the most pasture land, found the study from satellite tracking institute MapBiomas. It found the amount of pasture in the Amazon grew 40 percent in the past two decades, as Brazil emerged as the world's top beef powerhouse. bur-jhb/tjj"
2022-12-02,Brazilian Amazon deforestation remains near 15-year high,198,"By Associated Press Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon slowed slightly last year, a year after a 15-year high, according to closely watched numbers published Wednesday. The data was released by the National Institute for Space Research. The agency's Prodes monitoring system shows that the rainforest lost an area roughly the size of Qatar, some 4,500 square miles, in the 12 months from August 2021 to July 2022. That is down 11 percent compared with the previous year, when over 5,000 square miles was destroyed. For more than a decade, it looked as though things were getting better for the Brazilian Amazon.  Deforestation had declined dramatically and never rose back above 3,861 square miles. That was before the tenure of far-right President Jair Bolsonaro, beginning in January 2019. This will be the last report published under Bolsonaro, as he lost his reelection bid and will leave office Jan. 1. But part of the destruction that took place on his watch will not appear until next year, including the key months from August to October of 2022. A preview of those months comes from a different federal satellite system that issues faster but less accurate data: It shows deforestation skyrocketed 45 percent over the August to October period the prior year. Traditionally, that time of year sees peak destruction, due to the dry season. An analysis of the new yearly data from Climate Observatory, a network of environmental groups, shows that in the four years of Bolsonaro's leadership, deforestation rose 60 percent over the previous four years. That is the largest percentage rise under a presidency since satellite monitoring began in 1998. In one state, ParÃ¡, a fierce rate of destruction went down by 21 percent yet it was still the center of one-third of all Brazil's Amazon forest loss. Part of the tree cutting and burning happens in areas that are ostensibly protected. One such area is Paru State Forest, where the nonprofit Amazon Institute of People and the Environment registered 0.7 square miles of deforestation in just October. ""In recent years, deforestation has reached protected areas where previously there was almost no destruction,"" Jakeline Pereira, a researcher with the Amazon Institute, told the Associated Press. ""In Paru's region, the destruction is driven by lease of land for soybean crops and cattle."" Another critical area is the southern part of the state of Amazonas, the only state where deforestation increased in the most recent data, by 13 percent compared with the year before. It's largely attributable to Bolsonaro's push to pave about 250 miles of the only road that connects Manaus, home to 2.2 million people, with Brazil's larger urban centers farther south. Most Amazon deforestation occurs alongside roads where access is easier and land value is higher. Researchers and environmentalists have blamed Bolsonaro's policies for the surge in deforestation. The administration weakened environmental agencies and backed legislative measures to loosen land protections in the name of economic development, paired with a view of occupying a sparsely populated territory at any cost. This policy has emboldened land robbers and spurred more illegal mining. Bolsonaro's successor, leftist former President Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva, promised cheering crowds at the recent U.N. climate conference in Egypt to end all deforestation in the whole country by 2030. ""There will be no climate security if the Amazon isn't protected,"" he said. The last time da Silva was president, from 2003 to 2010, deforestation fell sharply. On the other hand, he backed initiatives that set in motion destruction in the long run, such as the construction of the mammoth Belo Monte hydroelectric dam and generous loans to the beef industry. Chopping down forest for pasture is the primary driver of deforestation. The Amazon rainforest, which covers an area twice the size of India, acts as a buffer against climate change by absorbing large amounts of carbon dioxide. It's also the most biodiverse forest in the world, and the home of tribes that have lived in the forest for thousands of years, some of them living in isolation. ""If da Silva wants to decrease forest destruction by 2023, he must have zero tolerance for environmental crime from day one of his administration. That includes holding accountable those who sabotaged environmental governance in the country while in office over the past four years,"" says Marcio Astrini, executive secretary of the Climate Observatory."
2023-01-12,Climate change and human rights: HRW's reading of Colombia's policies,199," Between 2018 and 2022, 14% of deforestation in the Amazon was concentrated in the Tinigua, La Macarena, Picachos, Chiribiquete, La Paya and Nukak Reserve parks. / Iván Muñoz ""The great contribution that Latin America can make to face the existential challenge of climate change is to protect the Amazon,"" says, bluntly, Juan Pappier, acting deputy director for the Americas of Human Rights Watch. The U.S. NGO launched this Thursday its global report on human rights in 2022 and in the chapter on Colombia, it states, among other things, that, on the road to protect the Amazon ecosystems, although the country has promised to do much, the results it has obtained have been rather limited. (Read also: Deforestation and peace: What does the evidence say?) The report states that, ""deforestation and forest fires are pushing the Amazon rainforest, a key bulwark against climate change, to a 'tipping point' from which it cannot recover, scientists warn"". There are extremely worrying cases, such as Brazil, where the policies of the now former president Jair Bolsonaro led to deforestation rates not seen in 15 years. Or Venezuela, where illegal mining is seriously affecting the environment and indigenous peoples. Human Rights Watch's diagnosis of deforestation in Colombia is not very encouraging either. First, it recalls that government statistics recorded that by 2021, 174,000 hectares of forest were deforested, an increase of 1.5% over the previous year. Secondly, it explains that at least 9,000 hectares of the deforested area are ""territories officially under the tenure of indigenous peoples, which in some cases caused their forced displacement"". (May be of interest to you: This is Colombia's position in the global ranking that measures performance in the face of climate change) And finally, it recalls that at least two thirds of the area devastated is in the Amazon. Meanwhile, the flagship strategy of the government of Iván Duque to address the problem of deforestation was Operation Artemisa, a military campaign criticized and about which human rights violations were constantly denounced. ""In practice it seemed more focused on capturing peasants who cut down trees than on dismantling the structures behind Colombia's massive deforestation,"" Pappier recalled. On the issue of deforestation, Human Rights Watch recalls, the authorities know who the main actors are. ""Cattle ranchers and FARC dissident groups are the main drivers of deforestation, pressuring residents to cut down trees, extorting farmers, promoting coca leaf cultivation for cocaine production, and threatening conservationists,"" the organization wrote in its chapter on Colombia. (May be of interest to you: Chile and Colombia consult the Inter-American Court on climate crisis and human rights) He adds that, in September 2022, the Minister of Environment, Susana Muhamad, announced that the new government would have another strategy against deforestation, focused on working with communities to prevent logging and promote investigations against the big players involved. ""President Petro's commitment to the issue is valuable and we are very attentive to how it will be implemented,"" commented Juan Pappier. Finally, Human Rights Watch warned in a statement that, in the Americas, ""rampant illegal deforestation is devastating the region's biodiversity and the livelihoods of those who live in the forests and, along with the fossil fuel industry, continues to be a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions."" And on this last front there are not many actions to highlight on the part of Colombia either, because although it committed to reduce its emissions in the Paris Agreement, Climate Action Tracker described the effort the country has made as ""very insufficient"".

2022-11-09,"COLOMBIA RECEIVES SUPPORT FROM GERMANY, NORWAY AND THE UK FOR IMPLEMENTING THEIR AMBITIOUS PLAN TO CONTAIN DEFORESTATION IN THE COLOMBIAN AMAZON",200,"The following information was released by the UK Government: Supported by Germany and local communities, Colombia will work to address deforestation in the Colombian Amazon. From: Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office and The Rt Hon Lord Goldsmith Published 9 November 2022 Minister Lord Zac Goldsmith met with his counterparts Susana Muhamad (Colombia), Jochen Flasbarth (Germany) and Espen Barth Eide (Norway) to express his support to Colombia's ambitious plan to contain deforestation in the Colombian Amazon. Colombia's government has launched an emergency plan to stop deforestation in the Colombian Amazon. The ambitious strategy consists of working with local communities and indigenous people in 22 deforestation hotspots, reaching agreements to strengthen economic, social and environmental conditions in these areas within 100 days of starting office, Colombia's Minister of Environment Susana Muhamad already signed the first agreements with communities to reduce deforestation in Caqueta, the country's second most deforested state in 2021 international partners praise the ambitious plan, and Norway and Germany will contribute 25 million USD under the Joint Declaration of Intent the sustainable use and conservation of the Amazon, the world's largest rainforest, is considered vital to curbing catastrophic climate change and to save unique biodiversity Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, 7 November 2022. Colombia has the third biggest forest area in South America and is known to have one of the most biodiverse forests in the world. In face of rising deforestation in the Colombian Amazon in first quarter of 2022, Colombia's government has launched an ambitious emergency plan to stop deforestation in the Amazon. The Colombian Minister of Environment and Sustainable Development, Susana Muhamad, said: Colombia is committed to the development of a solid forestry economy that contributes to the goals of zero net emissions, the guarantee and protection of the applicable rights of indigenous peoples and local communities, as well as the expansion of efforts to conserve and manage sustainably natural forests. The advances in social agreements with the communities of the areas with the greatest impact of deforestation are highlighted, with the aim of promoting sustainable forest management of natural forests, the ecological restoration of degraded areas and the sustainable use of biodiversity. The plan consists of focusing efforts in 22 deforestation hotspots in the Colombian Amazon and seeks to effectively reduce deforestation in the region where more than 50% of the deforestation of the Amazon is concentrated. Through social dialogue with communities, the Colombian government aims to reach agreements to strengthen the economic, social, and environmental conditions in these areas. Within 100 days after taking office, Minister of Environment Muhamad already signed the first agreements with communities to reduce deforestation. The agreements are part of a wider strategy to develop a National Fund to mobilize finance from national and international sources, promote a Forest Economy, improve sustainable livelihoods, and stop the expansion of the agricultural frontier. Espen Barth Eide, Minister of Climate and Environment, Norway, said: I am impressed by Colombia's ambitious emergency plan to stop deforestation in the Amazon. Such strong political will to protect the Amazon is essential if we are to reach the global climate goals and protect biodiversity, as well as total peace in Colombia. Norway remains a committed partner to Colombia in this effort. Norway, Germany and the United Kingdom stressed their commitment to support the impressive ambitions of Colombia's government in conserving fragile ecosystems such as the Amazon rainforest, whilst also protecting local environmental and human rights leaders and safeguarding the rights and safety of indigenous peoples, campesinos and afro-Colombian communities. Based on Colombia's achievements under the Joint Declaration of Intent, signed during COP25, Norway and Germany announced a donation of USD 25 million in support of Colombia's plan against deforestation. Lord Goldsmith, Minister of State for Climate and Environment at the United Kingdom Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office, said: We want to speed up and grow international support for committed and ambitious forest countries like Colombia, to spur even great action at both the jurisdictional and national level. Regulating voluntary carbon markets is essential for raising the finance we need to meet our climate, nature, and development goals throughout this decade. But those markets must be high integrity from beginning to end, and we are determined to involve rural and forest communities across the board to ensure they benefit from the natural resource they protect. Jochen Flasbarth, German State Secretary in the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development, said: We will keep supporting efforts to reduce deforestation in the future. We have to ensure that our common approach evolves and meets the challenges of the climate and biodiversity crisis. We will continue our engagement in the coming years to work towards these goals together with Colombia, Norway and the UK. It is an investment in our common future. The Joint Declaration of Intent (JDI) between Colombia, Germany, Norway and the United Kingdom is a cooperative partnership and an example of international collaboration, coordination and articulation to meet"
2022-11-10,Congress insists on passing law that encourages deforestation in the Amazon,201,"Congresswoman Elizabeth Medina, from the Teachers' Bloc of Concertación Nacional, has been insisting for a year that Parliament approve her bill, which seeks to promote deforestation in the Amazon. Last July 14, 2022, the legislative proposal obtained enough votes in the Plenary of the Congress, but the Executive Power observed it, so it returned to the hands of the Agrarian Commission. There, the congressmen again voted in favor of the bill, without making any substantive changes, despite reading the reasons why the initiative was harmful to the environment, in a communiqué signed by the President of the Republic, Pedro Castillo, and the Premier, Anibal Torres. The opinion, approved by insistence in the Agrarian Commission, will have to be debated in the Plenary of the Congress to decide if it will become a Law. The Ombudsman's Office, the Peruvian Society of Environmental Law, the Peruvian Association of Biologists, the National Commission for Development and Life without Drugs DEVIDA, among other civil organizations, expressed their disagreement with this legislative initiative. They expect the Executive Branch to observe the initiative again. Attempt against the Forestry and Wild Fauna Law The Agrarian Commission of the Congress approved on November 4, 2022 an opinion by insistence that seeks to modify the Forestry and Wildlife Law. The purpose is to modify articles 29 and 33 of the law, and to add two transitory complementary provisions, as well as a final complementary provision. According to the Executive Branch, the final complementary provision, as drafted, allows people who own land in the Amazon to develop agricultural or cattle raising activities on it, without the Ministry of the Environment giving them permission. Currently, the Peruvian State requires that holders of land in the Amazon adhere to Article 38 of the Forestry and Wildlife Law. This law states that the Ministry of the Environment must study the soils to determine whether they are forested, protected or suitable for agriculture. If they are forest and protection lands, agricultural activities cannot be carried out because they are not used to be worked, but rather to protect fragile ecosystems, preserve biodiversity and capture carbon dioxide, which slows down environmental pollution. Forest and protection lands also represent the identity of Amazonian communities. Tania García, commissioner of the environmental area of the Ombudsman's Office, also warned that this type of land should also not be granted in possession or ownership to any person. ""If it is determined that it is forest or protection land, there is no way you can do agricultural activities. They cannot even give you these lands either in possession or in ownership. The aim is to protect the soil resource because the soil resource sustains an entire ecosystem,"" he explained. When the Ministry of the Environment determines that a type of soil is suitable for agriculture, the regulation obliges the owners of the land to process two permits: the change of soil use and the authorization for land clearing. After carrying out both procedures, the environmental sector concludes how much of the total land is suitable for harvesting crops or raising animals. But the proposal approved by the Agrarian Commission of Congress would also allow land holders to skip these requirements, described in the regulations of the Forestry and Wildlife Law. It took two years to create this regulation precisely because it required prior consultation with Amazonian communities to know what processes they should follow in order to prevent forest and protection soils from being deforested. Now, with the permission that Congress would give them to exploit forest and protection lands, the owners would cut down the trees and carry out agricultural activities on the land. In other words, the Parliament seeks to exploit lands that in reality should not be touched and that citizens and companies no longer have to request the authorizations required by law. ""This represents a threat of massive deforestation and endangers the existence of forests in the Amazon (...) Thus, if a rural property that in general is being used for agriculture and livestock, which additionally has a part of forest, can be used for those economic activities, with the consequent cutting and burning for its change of use,"" said the Executive Power. Endangered forests The National Program for Forest Conservation and Climate Change identified through a study that deforestation in the Peruvian Amazon increased in 2020, a year in which 203,272 hectares of forests were deforested, 37% more than in 2019. The most degraded ecosystems were located in Loreto, Ucayali, San Martin, Madre de Dios and Cusco. With less forest in the Amazon, less carbon would be captured. This makes it impossible for Peru to meet its commitments under the Climate Change Convention, such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 40% by 2030. ""However, the level of deforestation reached in 2020 and that could be repeated in 2021, puts at risk the fulfillment of the commitments assumed"", detected the Executive. The changes that Congress is seeking to make to the Forestry and Wildlife Law would increase deforestation and make this goal even more unattainable. The Executive also pointed out that the bill, approved in the Plenary, lacked analysis of possible impacts on the forest, such as massive deforestation and damage to forest and wildlife resources. In addition, it would violate the Forestry and Wildlife Law and the Constitution. In spite of this, the Agrarian Commission again voted in favor of the proposal without making changes to avoid harming the Amazon. Tania García, from the Ombudsman's Office, affirmed that the changes made to the bill are more dangerous and encourage the deforestation of forests. ""With the changes made, land classification, land use change would no longer be required; it would no longer be important that you respect ecological and economic zoning. Nor would forest zoning be required,"" he said. The aforementioned zonings help determine the usefulness of each type of land. If the legislative proposal is approved as it is, it would free land owners in the Amazon from more permits. For the specialist, this legislative initiative will not solve the farmers' problems because forest and protection soils are not suitable for agricultural activities. They usually last up to five years if fertilizers and chemicals are not used, which would not be very convenient for farmers. ""There are millions of hectares in the highlands that are suitable for agriculture. Agriculture can be promoted on land that is indeed suitable for it. But what they do, instead of looking for solutions, is to deforest biodiversity. It doesn't matter if this affects indigenous territories because that is another very important human component,"" he said.

2022-11-16,"COP in Brazil stimulates deforestation reduction in the Amazon, says Carlos Nobre",202," Climatologist Carlos Nobre, one of the greatest references in global warming, praised the idea of taking the Climate Conference (COP) to the Amazon in 2025, as promised by president-elect Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (PT) in a speech on Wednesday, 16. The researcher followed the PT's speech at the Amazon governors' pavilion at COP-27, in Sharm el-Sheik, Egypt. ""(The idea of hosting the COP) is very good because it makes us look forward. With a COP in three years, we are going to fight hard to greatly reduce deforestation and then Brazil will be a great leader, maybe one of the greatest in the world,"" said Nobre, researcher at the Institute for Advanced Studies at USP and scientific director of the Institute for Climate Studies at the Federal University of Espírito Santo. Lula confirmed that he will ask the United Nations Organization (UNO) to host the event in three years - possibly in Amazonas or Pará. This request was made by the consortium of Amazonian governors, led by Helder Barbalho (MDB), head of the Pará state government. ""If Brazil manages to reduce deforestation in the Amazon and Cerrado, which are still very high, it will become the first country in the world with high emissions to reach its Paris Agreement goals (climate pact signed by 195 countries in 2015). We can reach the 2030 goal before 2030 and the 2050 goal in 2040? he said. The Brazilian goal foresees reaching carbon neutrality (offsetting all greenhouse gas emissions) by mid-century. About 50% of Brazilian emissions come from deforestation, ""almost all of it illegal"", highlights Nobre. China, on the other hand, has 80% of its emissions related to the burning of fossil fuels - which makes cutting atmospheric pollution more difficult, given the economic impacts and the costs of energy transition. Scientist defends zero deforestation in the forestIn the case of the Amazon biome, specifically, Nobre argues that it is necessary to ""zero out"" deforestation, even though the Forest Code allows landowners to clear 20% of their areas. The measure is necessary, he argues, because the Amazon is very close to the so-called tipping point (point of no return), a stage from which the biome will no longer be able to recover, which will have severe impacts on the region's biodiversity and the planet's climate. ""To save the Amazon, which is very close to the tipping point, we will need to zero deforestation - throughout the Amazon, not just in Brazil. We have more than 1 million square meters deforested and another 1 million degraded. There is no need to deforest any more, we can triple food production in the region without cutting down a single tree"", he emphasizes. In the last four years, the Jair Bolsonaro administration has been the target of criticism due to the escalating deforestation in the Amazon. The international community's expectation is that Lula will promote a change in the policy for combating environmental crimes."
2022-11-11,Deforestation brings the Amazon to a point of no return,203,"Deforestation is increasing in the Amazon forests, whose integrity may reach a point of no return, directly affecting 47 million people and aggravating the planetary climate and biodiversity crises, warned a new report by the World Wildlife Fund. According to WWF's ""Amazon Alive 2022"" report, presented at the World Climate Summit in this Egyptian city, 18% of Amazon forests have been completely lost, another 17% are degraded and data from the first half of this year show that the damage continues to grow. The loss of the Amazon biome could directly affect the livelihoods of 47 million people living in this region spread across nine nations, including 511 different indigenous groups, as well as 10% of the planet's biodiversity, WWF said. The report was presented at the 27th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which brings together representatives of most of the world's governments in this seaside resort town on the shores of the Red Sea. One of the consequences of the loss of the Amazon biome is that it would make impossible a central objective of the climate summits, that of keeping the increase in global temperature below 1.5 degrees Celsius in relation to the pre-industrial era. That goal cannot be met, according to the report, if the Amazon rainforest is lost, since its vegetation and soils store between 367 and 733 gigatons of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas that warms the atmosphere. ""At the same time, the carbon stored for centuries in the Amazon is also being released at an accelerated rate due to deforestation, fires and unsustainable productive activities,"" the text added. WWF said that, joining the clamor of Amazonian indigenous organizations, it proposes ""a global effort to protect 80% of the Amazon by 2025,"" in transition to an ecologically healthy region. A month ago, a meeting of Amazonian indigenous organizations in Lima launched the 80×25 initiative to protect in principle 244 million hectares, an area larger than Algeria and almost as large as Argentina, whose biome is at risk because it does not have adequate protection status. ""Up to 20% of the forests have been destroyed, by an oil well, illegal mining, fires, logging, introduction of monocultures and cattle ranching,"" said Gregorio Díaz Mirabal, leader of the Coordinating Committee of Indigenous Organizations of the Amazon Basin, a Venezuelan indigenous Curripaco. He added that the indigenous peoples of the Amazon ""no longer want the forest area to fall below 80%, because it would be our destruction"". According to the Amazonian Network of Geo-referenced Socio-environmental Information (Red Amazónica de Información Socioambiental Georreferenciada), they are exposed to extractive activities because they do not have the protective status of protected areas or indigenous territories. WWF therefore proposed ""securing and expanding a mosaic of protected areas and protected indigenous territories,"" which ""must be governed and managed equitably, along with integrated landscape management approaches for conservation and sustainable development."" It also requires ""high-level political commitment that directly addresses the main drivers of Amazonian loss, such as deforestation, illegal mining, corruption, indiscriminate use of wildlife and other natural resources, and infrastructure planned without ecosystem considerations."" At COP27, the President of Colombia, Gustavo Petro, proposed ""saving the Amazon rainforest as a substantial part of an agenda to solve the climate crisis"", and proposed the creation of a new multilateral fund ""capable for 20 years of financing the social, peasant and agricultural forces"" present in the area. These groups, ""in general humble people, are today agents of destruction of the forest"", so according to Petro they should be ""transformed into a positive force, which means paying them monthly for environmental services, for taking care and letting the Amazon forest grow"". For this fund Colombia will have 200 million dollars a year, and Petro said that he has the support of neighboring Venezuela and hopes to obtain it from Brazil, which occupies more than 60% of the Amazon. The 80×25 initiative proposes legal recognition, demarcation and financing of indigenous peoples' territories, and to halt the advance of deforestation, especially that which is carried out illegally and on a commercial scale, in primary forests, of high biological value or in areas that are reaching local points of no return. Also, to promote a development model that stops the drivers of deforestation and degradation; to finance a large-scale ecological restoration program; and to protect biodiversity and endangered species. ""Meeting the 80×25 target is part of a global effort to establish a transition to an ecologically healthy Amazon, a shift towards social equity, inclusive economic development and global responsibility,"" summarized Kurt Holle, director of Amazon Coordination at WWF."

Between January and October, a total of 9,994 square kilometers of the world's largest tropical rainforest was cleared, the highest rate of deforestation since record-keeping began in 2015.  Deforestation in the rainforest in the first ten months of the year has already exceeded that of all of 2021, when 8,219 square kilometers was cleared, according to the monthly information recorded by the real-time deforestation detection (DETER) system.  Based on the information collected by DETER through satellite images, the INPE issues alerts about the areas being deforested in the Amazon.  A total of 4,586 deforestation alerts were issued in October.  Under right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro's leadership in the last four years, deforestation in the Amazon rainforest has skyrocketed to levels not seen since 2008.

2022-11-14,Deforestation In Brazil's Amazon Hits Record High In October,205,"Nov 14, 2022( Latin Times: http://www.latintimes.com Delivered by Newstex)   The deforestation statistics in Brazil's Amazon rainforest reached a record high in October after 903.86 square kilometers (348.98 square miles) were cleared in the region last month.  According to the preliminary government satellite data collected by space research agency Inpe, about 903.86 square kilometers (348.98 square miles) were cleared in Brazil's Amazon region in October. This is the highest for the period since tracking began in 2015 and is up 3.1% year-on-year, Yahoo News [1]reported.  Meanwhile, from January to October of 2022, about 9,494 square kilometers were cleared in the Amazon. This is equal to an area more than 12 times the size of New York City. This also set a record for the amount of land cleared in Amazon in this period, exceeding the previous high set in 2019 by 12.7%.  Incoming leftist President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who will take over on Jan. 1 from far-right incumbent Jair Bolsonaro, has promised to curb deforestation in the Amazon by bolstering law enforcement, Al Jazeera[2] reported.  Bolsonaro reportedly rolled back environmental protections during his time in office and pushed for more mining and other development projects in the Amazon, saying they would stimulate the economy. The rainforest saw years of increased deforestation under the administration of outgoing President Jair Bolsonaro.  Annual statistics that were released last year showed that deforestation had already surged to a 15-year high under Bolsonaro.  Meanwhile, Lula, in a victory speech after defeating Bolsonaro, said that Brazil was 'ready to resume its leading role in the fight against the climate crisis.' He also has pledged to 'fight for zero deforestation', especially by protecting the Amazon.  Meanwhile, the Brazilian branch of the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) said that the increase in Amazon deforestation in October was expected. However, they added that the preliminary data for the first days of November is terrifying.'  Mariana Napolitano, WWF-Brasil's science manager, said she already expected deforestation to spike during the transition period and highlighted how fire alerts have rocketed since the election was declared in Lula's favor on Oct. 30.  ""Those who profit from illegality noticed there is still an opportunity window opened but it's about to close. Those figures are really scary,"" she said.  The burning season in the Amazon usually occurs between August and September of every year. However, fire alerts in the Amazon in the first ten days of November have nearly matched those reported in all of that month in 2021.

Ecologists warn that the rainforest is reaching the 'point of no return'. RIO DE JANEIRO. The Brazilian Amazon lost 903.8 square kilometers of rainforest in October, 3% more than the same month last year and a new record for the period, according to deforestation alerts released this November 11, 2022 by the Brazilian Institute of Special Research (INPE). In the year's accumulated, the most extensive rainforest on the planet also beat a new historical mark with 9,994 square kilometers of native vegetation devastated, the highest rate since 2015 when the measurement began, according to deforestation alerts released by the National Institute of Space Research (Inpe).

2022-10-07,Deforestation in Brazilian Amazon reaches record high in September due to fires,207,"By Gabriel Araujo SAO PAULO, Oct 7 (Reuters) - Deforestation of Brazil's Amazon rainforest was the highest for a September since records began, government data showed on Friday for last month, when fires in the region soared to a decade high. Satellite data from Brazil's space research agency INPE showed that 1,455 square kilometers were cleared in the Amazon last month, up 48% from a year ago and more than the September 2019 record for a data series dating back to 2015 Friday's preliminary figures also showed record deforestation for the first nine months of the year, according to INPE, with 8,590 square kilometers from January to September, equivalent to an area 11 times the size of New York City and a 22.6% increase over last year. Annual statistics released last year showed that deforestation had already soared to a 15-year high during President Jair Bolsonaro's administration. Experts blame the far-right leader, who is currently running for re-election, for rolling back environmental protections, opening the way for loggers and ranchers to illegally log more of the Amazon. Bolsonaro's office referred a Reuters request for comment to the Justice Ministry, which said it has been conducting a police operation since last year to combat illegal deforestation and forest fires and to protect indigenous lands. The Environment Ministry did not respond to a request for comment. The acceleration of deforestation had ""quite relevant impacts not only for the biome, but also for the region's climate and rainfall regime, as well as economic impacts for those living in the Amazon and in Brazil as a whole,"" said Mariana Napolitano, science manager for WWF-Brazil. The annual fire season in the Amazon occurs in August and September, when fires tend to increase due to less rainfall, allowing ranchers and farmers to burn areas for deforestation. Last month, INPE fire alerts reached the highest monthly level since September 2010. (Reporting by Gabriel Araujo and Peter Frontini Edited in Spanish by Javier López de Lérida)"

2022-11-30,Deforestation in the Amazon declines for the first time in Bolsonaro's administration,209,"Rio de Janeiro, Nov. 30. The Brazilian Amazon lost 11,568 kilometers of vegetation cover between August 2021 and July 2022, an extension 11.3% less than that devastated in the immediately preceding year, thus deforestation recorded its first reduction since the arrival to power of Jair Bolsonaro. According to data released Wednesday by the National Institute for Space Research (INPE), deforestation in the last year was the second highest in the last 14 years, surpassed only by that of the 2020-2021 period (13,038 square kilometers). The data disclosed are from the Amazon Deforestation Satellite Monitoring Project (Prodes), a tool that measures annual devastation by analyzing satellite images and has a much higher degree of confidence than the Deter system, which INPE uses to measure logging on a monthly basis. According to calculations by the Climate Observatory, a network that brings together several environmental groups, including international ones such as Greenpeace and WWF, the average deforestation in Bolsonaro's four-year term was 11,396 square kilometers per year, with a 59.5% jump compared to the previous four years. According to this network, despite the reduction in the last year, deforestation rates remain very high, especially at a time when scientists warn that the destruction of the Amazon is reaching a point of no return. Environmentalists attribute the increased devastation of the world's largest rainforest to the anti-environmentalist rhetoric of the far-right leader, who dismantled oversight agencies, relaxed legislation and defended the economic exploitation of the Amazon even in indigenous reserves. Deforestation fell from an average of 21,617 kilometers per year in Lula's first government (2003-2006), when the progressive leader began to adopt environmental protection measures, to 5,473 kilometers per year in Dilma Rousseff's first term (2011-2014), but grew in Michel Temer's administration (2016-2018) and skyrocketed in Bolsonaro's. The Climate Observatory stated that the international community's criticism of Bolsonaro's management of the Amazon forced INPE to postpone until Wednesday the release of the report, which was ready before the start of the COP27 climate conference, which ended on November 20 in Egypt. The executive secretary of the Climate Observatory, Márcio Astrini, warned that the data released Wednesday do not take into account the deforestation of the last five months of Bolsonaro's term, in which record rates of devastation are being recorded. ""The most recent numbers indicate that logging continues out of control. Bolsonaro will leave his successor a cursed inheritance. If he wants to reduce deforestation, Lula will need a zero-tolerance policy towards logging,"" said Astrini. EFE cm/mp/szg"
2022-11-13,Deforestation in the Amazon does not stop and in 2022 it is already higher than last year,210,"The Brazilian Institute of Special Research (INPE) reported that the Brazilian Amazon lost 903.8 square kilometers of rainforest during the month of October, 3% more than in the same period last year. According to the INPE alert, this figure sets a new negative record for October, including the 4,586 deforestation warnings sent by the satellite system that supports these analyses in real time. In the first 10 months of 2022, INPE indicates, the accumulated record was also broken with 9,994 square kilometers of native vegetation razed, the highest rate since this caption began to be measured in 2015. The devastation of the Amazon rainforest up to October already exceeds that of the entire 2021, when 8,219 square kilometers were affected, the alert adds. ""The moment is crucial for the Amazon, because the world's climate depends on it and, consequently, the economy, agriculture and the health of all the inhabitants of this planet. We need to leave the realm of promises and move on to real action,"" said André Freitas, representative of Greenpeace Brazil, in a statement on the data. In this sense, environmental organizations around the world warn that the rate of deforestation of the Brazilian Amazon will lead to the threshold of no return. Analysts have pointed out the coincidence of this dismal trend of environmental destruction with the mandate of President Jair Bolsonaro during the last four years, at unprecedented levels. In this context, Brazil's former Minister of the Environment, Marina Silva, assured this week at the Climate Summit in Egypt that,in the government of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, the preservation of the Amazon will be a priority of the administration that will begin on January 1, 2023. Brazil will protect the Amazon ""with its own efforts"" and will not make it conditional on the receipt of international funds, she affirmed this Saturday at COP27. She also announced that to define and implement policies it will work in an inter-ministerial manner. Lula's ally acknowledged that there is an urgent task in recomposing the budgets allocated to the preservation of the Amazon, cut by the Bolsonaro government, and also the teams specialized in conservation. ""It is not something difficult, it will be necessary to replace inadequate people, military men who do not know about the environment"", with ""technical teams"" capable of doing their job and that are ""threatened and besieged by the current government"", she explained."
2022-11-30,"Deforestation in the Amazon drops 11%, but remains above 10 thousand square kilometers",211,"For the fourth consecutive year, deforestation in the Amazon, in one year, exceeded 10 thousand km². The data from the Prodes program, from Inpe (National Institute for Space Research), released on Wednesday (30), show that 11,568 km² of forest were cut down from August 2021 to July 2022. The figure, however, is about 11% lower than the previous year's rate and interrupts a sequence of growth that had been going on since 2018. In any case, the numbers remain high, especially when considering the warnings that the Amazon is not far from a point of no return, in which, due to deforestation, the forest could undergo savannization, with the loss of its biodiversity and ecosystem services. The situation is even more critical if we consider the advancing climate crisis, which makes more and more explicit the extreme events that will be experienced even more frequently by the world's population. Containing deforestation, especially in the Amazon, is central to Brazil's role in the climate crisis, considering that forest clearing is the main source of greenhouse gas emissions in the country. In addition, the explosive deforestation that occurred under the government of Jair Bolsonaro (PL), has been causing problems for the Brazilian international image, which consequently leads to greater commercial difficulties and loss of partnerships - the maximum example was the paralysis of the billionaire Amazon Fund. Since before the beginning of his administration, Bolsonaro has questioned deforestation and fire data produced by Inpe, a government agency. He has also publicly criticized actions to combat deforestation. The Prodes data show that, again, the states with the highest deforestation rates were Pará, Amazonas, Mato Grosso and Rondônia, which account for almost 88% of the documented deforestation. Amazonas, thus, for the second consecutive year, occupies the second position in the devastation ranking, which until 2020 was occupied by Mato Grosso. The advance of deforestation in the state is a cause for attention and concern, considering the still large and well-conserved areas in the region. In fact, from August 2021 to July 2022, Amazonas was the only state to register an increase in deforestation in relation to the previous Prodes. The growth was about 13%. Pará and Mato Grosso, the other states that complete the top three deforestation states, had reductions of, respectively, almost 21% and about 14%. Despite only being released this Wednesday, according to Folha's research, the MCTI (Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation) had already received the data before the COP27, the UN climate conference, which ended on November 20. During the event, the reporter even asked Environment Minister Joaquim Leite about the Prodes data. His answer was: ""I have no idea"". The technical note published by Inpe on Wednesday has the date of November 3 registered, that is, even before the beginning of COP27. During the COP27, Brazil's official booth kept its distance from the Amazon and tried to spread the idea that Brazil is a green energy country - which is true, in general terms, even though the energy matrix has been a little dirtier after the boost given to coal-fired thermoelectric plants. In the midst of the climate crisis and its devastating effects, Leite used his speech at the climate conference to say that he does not believe in an ""extremely forced reduction of emissions, via taxes and costs to various economic sectors, with the risk of generating green inflation and increasing poverty. The minister was also absent from the negotiations. This is not the first time that Jair Bolsonaro's government avoids disclosing deforestation data at a COP on climate - a tradition that has been maintained since 2005 by Brazilian governments. In 2021, the Minister of the Environment, Joaquim Leite, defended during the COP26 (held in Scotland) that deforestation in the Amazon was showing a downward trend, using data from the last months of Deter (Deforestation Detection System in Real Time). Although the annual data from Prodes had been available since October 27 of that year, the government only revealed the result after a note from SindCT (the union of federal public servants in the aerospace sector) stated that the information had been available for almost a month. The Planet in Transe project is supported by the Open Society Foundations."
2022-12-09,Deforestation in the Amazon drops from the previous year,212,"SAO PAULO, Dec 1 (ANSA) - The Amazon had a deforestation of 11,568km² between August 2021 and July 2022, a drop of 11% compared to the same period between 2020 and 2021, reported the National Institute for Space Research (Inpe) on Wednesday (30).  The data are based on the Project for Monitoring Deforestation in the Legal Amazon by Satellite (Prodes) and were ready since early November, but the government of Jair Bolsonaro delayed the release. The numbers are more accurate than the Real-Time Deforestation Detection System (Deter), which uses alerts and releases them monthly.  Despite the drop, the four years of Bolsonaro's administration saw a 59.5% expansion in Amazon deforestation, according to the NGO Observatório do Clima. The current president took the annual average of destruction at 7,145km² and hands over the government with 11,396km².  ""The Bolsonaro regime has been a forest destruction machine. The only good news from the current government is its end,"" said Marcio Astrini, the NGO's executive secretary, in a statement.  The representative also points out that Deter indicates ""that devastation continues out of control. ""Jair Bolsonaro will leave his successor a cursed legacy of increasing deforestation and a conflagrated Amazon. If he wants to see forest destruction numbers decrease by 2023, Lula will have to have zero tolerance for environmental crime from the first day of his government,"" he adds.  According to the Deter data, between August and October this year - months that will only be entered via Prodes in 2023 - there is a 45% increase in the area of deforestation alerts in comparison with the previous year.  The NGO also made a table to compare the presidents and the relation of decrease or increase in the deforestation rate. In Fernando Henrique Cardoso's governments (1995-2002), there was a 42.5% increase in the rate in the first four years (19,457km² annual average) and a 3.2% decrease in the second (18,825km²).  During the governments of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (2003-2010), there was a high of 14.8% in the comparison of the first mandate with the last one of FHC (21,617km²) and a strong retraction of 54.8% in the second (9,756km²).  Dilma Rousseff maintained the downward trajectory in her first term (2011-2014), with -43.9% of deforested area, which represents 5,473km². In the two years before the impeachment (compared to the two previous years), there was a rise of 29.3% (7,050km²). In the two years of Michel Temer (2017-2018), the rise was 2.7% with an annual average of 7,241km², bringing the average in the period 2015-2018 to 7,145km².(ANSA). "
2022-11-30,"Deforestation in the Amazon falls 11% in one year, but the Bolsonaro administration has seen an increase of 59.5%.",213," Deforestation in the Amazon between August 2021 and July this year reached 11,568 km², according to data from the National Institute for Space Research (Inpe), an agency linked to the Ministry of Science and Technology. The drop is 11% compared to the same period last year. The four years of the Jair Bolsonaro (PL) administration, however, saw an increase of 59.5% in destruction, compared to the previous four years, during the Dilma Rousseff (PT) and Michel Temer (MDB) administrations, according to a calculation made by the Climate Observatory based on official data. Bolsonaro has been the target of criticism in Brazil and abroad for weakening the inspection and punishment bodies for environmental crimes. It is the highest percentage increase in a presidential term since satellite measurements began in 1988. Bolsonaro surpassed even the high seen in the first Fernando Henrique Cardoso administration, when the heating up of the economy at the beginning of the Real Plan caused the largest deforestation in the historical series, of 29,000 km², in 1995. The annual average under Bolsonaro was 11,396 km², compared to 7,145 km² in the previous period (2015-2018). The States of Pará, Amazonas, Mato Grosso and Rondônia correspond to 87.89% of the deforestation estimated by the Program for Monitoring the Brazilian Amazon Forest by Satellite (Prodes), of Inpe. The data for 2022 reveal an explosion of deforestation in Amazonas, the only state with an increase in clear cuts this year. A total of 2,607 km² were cut down, an increase of 13% in relation to 2021. Pará, even with a 21% reduction, still leads the ranking, with 4,141 km² lost in 2022. Prodes considers as deforestation the complete removal of primary forest cover by clear cutting or the final stage of a progressive degradation of the forest in which there is a complete loss of the canopy, regardless of the future use of these areas. Prodes is responsible for the official deforestation balances. According to Marcio Astrini, from the Climate Observatory, ""the only good news from the current government is its end"". At the Climate Summit held this month in Egypt, the COP-27, the president-elect Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (PT) promised zero deforestation as one of the goals of the new administration. The international community's expectation is that Brazil will turn around its environmental policy in the next few years. The technical team of the elected government is working with a list of priorities in the environmental area, in an attempt to stanch the short-term effects of measures taken by the Bolsonaro government. A crucial point of this work, according to Estadão, is to adopt measures to suspend the current rules for environmental fines, which have allowed the prescription of thousands of violations committed throughout the country."
2022-11-09,"Deforestation In The Amazon Is Accelerating The Point Of No Return, Warns WWF",214,"(TNSrpt) -- WWF Global issued the following news release: WWF's Living Amazon Report, published today, argues that threats to the integrity of the Amazon must be stopped through urgent measures to protect 80% of the rainforest by 2025 (80x25). Drawing on the latest available research, the report shows that without urgent action, the rainforest could reach a point of no return, directly affecting the livelihoods of the 47 million people living in the Amazon, 511 indigenous peoples groups, 10% of the planet's biodiversity, and aggravating the global climate and biodiversity crises. Despite the stark warnings that the Amazon faced this point of no return from the Science Panel for the Amazon (SPA) at COP 26, a year on, deforestation is accelerating rather than decreasing. The Panel's data shows that 18% of Amazon forests have been converted to other uses and an additional 17% are highly degraded. The report also warns that the vital goal of keeping global warming to 1.5 C cannot be met if the Amazon Rainforest is lost, as it stores between 367 - 733 Gt of CO2 in its vegetation and soils. At the same time, the carbon stored for centuries in the Amazon is also being released at an accelerated rate due to deforestation, fires, and unsustainable production activities. Reversing this trend, and protecting 80% of the rainforest, will require securing and extending a mosaic of protected areas and protected indigenous territories - currently half of the forest - which must be equitably governed and managed, along with integrated landscape management approaches for conservation and sustainable development, according to WWF. The report argues that saving the Amazon will also require a high-level political commitment that directly addresses the main drivers of Amazon loss such as deforestation, illegal mining, corruption, indiscriminate use of fauna and other natural resources, and infrastructure planned without ecosystem considerations. ""Meeting the 80x25 goal is part of a global effort to transition to an ecologically healthy Amazon. This requires a shift towards social equity, inclusive economic development, and global responsibility"" remarked Kurt Holle, WWF's Amazon Coordination Unit/ Peru Director. In the context of global environmental change, ""the Amazon is caught in the intersection between the climate and biodiversity crises, with the destruction of its ecosystems diminishing the possibility of limiting temperature increase to 1.5 C"" said Roberto Troya, Regional Director for WWF Latin America and the Caribbean, adding that ""urgent action is needed to avoid global repercussions and to ensure that this region can continue to regulate the planet's climate and to provide environmental and cultural benefits to the world"". During an event at COP27 launching the report, a global call for key stakeholders from diverse sectors to join the Coordinator of Indigenous Organizations of the Amazon Basin (COICA)'s 80x25 initiative to protect at least 80% of the Amazon was issued. According to the group, accomplishing this goal will require: a regional Pan-Amazonian vision with strengthened policies and institutions to implement it; 100% legal recognition, demarcation, and financing of indigenous peoples' territories; moratoria or other policies for halting deforestation, in particular, that which is carried out illegally and at a commercial scale, in primary forests, areas of high biological value, or areas that are already reaching local tipping points; foster a development model that stops the drivers of deforestation and degradation, and promotes deforestation-free supply chains; finance a large-scale ecological restoration program; protect biodiversity and threatened species, among other strategies. * * * REPORT: https://wwfint.awsassets.panda.org/img/original/lar2022_eng_digital.pdf * * * Original text here: https://wwf.panda.org/wwf_news/press_releases/?6794391/Deforestation-in-the-Amazon-is-accelerating-the-point-of-no-return-warns-WWF [Category: Environment] Copyright Targeted News Services C22-SUharpal-7993226 C22-SUharpal"
2022-11-04,Deforestation in the Amazon reaches the 3rd highest mark for the month of October,215,"As has been the case since the beginning of 2022, the Amazon saw significant deforestation in October. The 813.2 km² of forest felled is the third highest value for the recent history of Deter, a program of Inpe (National Institute for Space Research), which began in 2015. The rate of deforestation last month should still increase, however, considering that the data from Inpe only received updates until October 28. The number comes to light on the eve of COP27, the UN (United Nations) conference on climate change, in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. Once again, deforestation will be a sensitive issue for the Jair Bolsonaro (PL) government at the conference -which should try, when possible, to avoid the subject and focus on Brazil as a green energy country. Also expected soon is the release of the Prodes deforestation rate, the Inpe program that measures the annual deforestation in the biome. Last year, the Prodes data were already available during the COP26, but were only released by the Bolsonaro government after the event. The Deter does not have the objective of measuring deforestation, but rather of assisting public policies to combat deforestation. However, from its data it is possible to observe destruction trends. Since the beginning of 2022, at least, the monthly deforestation data indicated by Deter have been high and, in several cases, the highest in recent history for a given month. January, February, April, June, and September were records, for example. August was just below the record for 2019, the first year of the Bolsonaro government. It is worth mentioning that all of the highest monthly deforestation numbers recorded by Deter occurred under Bolsonaro's administration. The recent historical data starts in 2015, when there was an update in the sensors of the Deter program that makes it impossible to make a proper comparison with previous years, where there was a lower accuracy. Bolsonaro, since the beginning of his government, has minimized the importance of deforestation data and even accused Inpe of being at the service of other interests. One such instance of accusations without proof led to the exoneration of Ricardo Galvão. At the time, the president had claimed that Inpe's data did not correspond to the truth and suggested that Galvão might be at the ""service of some NGO."" Ricardo Galvão, who ran for federal deputy in the last election but was not elected, responded to the attacks. Despite previously criticizing Inpe data and claiming that most of the Amazon is untouched -which is false-, during the debates for the presidential election, Bolsonaro used such data to claim that deforestation and burning was higher during previous governments. The statement is not false, but lacks context. While other governments generally received a situation with higher deforestation, there were actions that brought down the levels of destruction. Meanwhile, during the Bolsonaro government, the country saw deforestation levels explode and exceed more than 10 thousand km² of destroyed forest per year."
2022-10-07,Deforestation in the Amazon sets a new record for the month of September,216," The deforested area in the Amazon in September was the largest since the beginning of the historical series in 2016, with a record 1,455km², 48% higher than the mark in September last year, 985km². The data are from the Deter system, of the Institute for Space Research (Inpe), released on Friday (7). The survey also shows that from January 1st to September 30th deforestation alerts were registered for 8,590km². This represents deforestation 23% above that recorded in the same period last year, 7,006km², and more than double the 2018 figure, 4,081km². In September, alerts were concentrated in the states of Pará (36%), Mato Grosso (23%), Amazonas (20%) and Rondônia (11%). The most deforested municipalities in September were União do Sul (MT), with 111km², Lábrea (AM), with 83km² and São Félix do Xingu (PA), with 72km². For Mariana Napolitano, WWF-Brazil's Science Manager, deforestation in the Amazon is growing at an exponential rate, with ""serious consequences"" for the country, since environmental destruction impacts on aspects such as rainfall and food production. ""The deforestation rate in the first nine months of 2022 doubled between 2018 and 2020, going from 4,000 km² to more than 8,000 km² - it is an unprecedented growth,"" he said. Cristiane Mazzetti, Greenpeace Brazil's Amazon spokesperson, defends better proposals for the environmental agenda, since, according to her, the government has acted improperly in protecting the Amazon. ""This has resulted in an increase in CO2 emissions and many losses for our country: in three years, an area equivalent to one and a half times the state of Sergipe, was deforested in the Amazon. In addition, many indigenous lives have been lost as a result of increased invasions on their lands. This project of destruction cannot continue,"" said Mazzetti. ""If government policy continues to allow and encourage the rapid deforestation of the forest, we will seriously compromise our future. Therefore, Brazilians should think deeply about their choice in the second round and vote for the climate, for the forests, and for the future of Brazil. To continue with the current policy is to accelerate the collapse of the Amazon instead of using the little time we have to avoid it. If it continues like this, the Amazon has no chance"", he added. Cerrado In September, 262km² were devastated. It is the lowest value since 2020, but even so the accumulated deforestation in the year already reaches 4,837km², a value 24% higher than the one registered in 2021, according to the Deter System. From a regional perspective, deforestation in the Cerrado was once again concentrated in the MATOPIBA states in 2021: Bahia, with 1,228km², Maranhão with 1,166km², and Tocantins, 752km².

2022-10-06,Deforestation in the Amazon under Bolsonaro's administration is equivalent to the area of the state of RJ,217,"President Jair Bolsonaro (PL), who is seeking reelection, is expected to end his four years in office with a total of 47,000 km² of deforestation in the Amazon. The number represents the total area destroyed according to estimates by the National Institute for Space Research (Inpe) between 2019 and 2022 and is 60% greater than that recorded in the previous four years in the Dilma Rousseff (PT) and Michel Temer (MDB) governments. The area deforested in the Bolsonaro administration is larger than the entire state of Rio de Janeiro, for example, with its 43 thousand km². If this damage is compared with the extension of the city of São Paulo, it is equivalent to saying that, during the government of the current president, an area of forest equivalent to the São Paulo capital was deforested every 45 days. . This year, according to the specialists, an extremely conservative projection indicates at least another 12 thousand km² of cuttings, but the indications are that this volume for 2022 should be close to 15 thousand km². These numbers are outside the historical curve. Inpe data indicate that in the previous four years, from 2015 to 2018, the total volume of deforestation in the Amazon reached 28,583 km². The report questioned the Ministry of Environment (MMA) about the deforestation data, but the portfolio said it would not comment because the question must be answered by the Justice portfolio. Federal agencies for combating deforestation, such as Ibama and the Chico Mendes Institute (ICMBio), are directly linked to the Ministry of Environment. Operation Guardians of the Biome, which combats environmental crimes, is coordinated by the Ministry of Justice. The action - which brings together agents of the National Force, Ibama and ICMBio - was only launched in July 2021, two and a half years after Bolsonaro reached the Planalto Palace. Also questioned by the report, the Ministry of Justice did not respond. The legal consultant of the Socio-environmental Institute (ISA), Mauricio Guetta, says that the data expose the way the Bolsonaro administration has always faced the environmental area. ""Since the first day of 2019, the government has systematically encouraged environmental crime and dismantled all public policies and institutions for environmental protection. The result is the uncontrolled deforestation and other illegal activities, such as mining on indigenous lands, in addition to the failure to meet climate targets,"" he says. Professor of Environmental Law, Guetta also calls attention to the external damage that these numbers produce to the economy and image of Brazil. ""The damage is irreparable, not only in the environmental and social spheres, but also in the economic sphere, with loss of investment and international credibility. For Marcio Astrini, executive secretary of the Climate Observatory, there is a possibility that the ""tragedy will increase even more"" since Bolsonaro, if re-elected, has not signaled for a change in forest preservation policies. The network is formed by 68 Brazilian civil society organizations that work on the socio-environmental and climate agenda. Carbon emissions have doubled in the Amazon A study conducted by 30 Brazilian scientists and released on Wednesday, 5 by the Climate Observatory shows that record deforestation and fires in the first two years of the Bolsonaro government caused an 89% increase in carbon gas emissions in 2019 and 122% in 2020, compared to the annual average recorded between 2010 and 2018. The study, coordinated by Inpe researcher Luciana Gatti, points out that in 2019 the increase in emissions was the result of the 79% increase in deforestation and 14% increase in the area burned in the Amazon, compared to the average of the nine years preceding the current government. In the first year of Bolsonaro's administration, the environmental fines levied fell by 30%. The drop in the fines paid was even greater, 74%. In 2020, when CO2 emissions more than doubled, deforestation rose 74% and the area burned increased 42%. The fines levied dropped 54%, while the fines paid dropped 89%.

2022-10-08,Deforestation In The Amazon Worse Than Ever For September Ahead Of Brazilian Elections,218,"Greenpeace UK posted the following news release: An area of the Amazon almost twice the size of New York City was deforested in September, according to alerts from the Brazilian Space Research Institute (INPE)'s system DETER. 1,455 km2 is the largest area ever recorded for the month of September. The data shows an increase of 48% compared to the same month last year. 2022 has seen record-breaking numbers of fires and deforestation. From January to September, 8,590 km(2) of the Amazon was deforested (11 times the size of NYC). And in the past three years, an area larger than Belgium was deforested in the Amazon according to the official government database PRODES. Cristiane Mazzetti, spokesperson for Greenpeace Brazil, said: ""In recent years, the Bolsonaro government has shown complete disregard for a safe climate and for the Amazon rainforest, Indigenous Peoples and traditional communities. His administration has actively promoted an anti-environment, anti-Indigenous and anti-democratic agenda that has resulted in a severe increase in carbon emissions and that paints a grave scenario in Brazil. This destructive project cannot continue."" Paul Morozzo, senior food and forests campaigner at Greenpeace UK, said: ""Bolsonaro has allowed and in fact encouraged catastrophic levels of deforestation in the Amazon and other climate-critical Brazilian forests. His administration has also lobbied the UK and EU to try and block crucial legislation that could stop deforestation-linked products entering our markets. ""The Brazilian elections are not just about the future of Brazil, the result will have an impact on all of humanity. If we lose the Amazon, we lose the fight against the climate crisis."" By emboldening forest destruction, the Brazilian government's actions have also caused an increase in violence in the field against Indigeneous Peoples and environmental defenders. According to a report published by NGO CIMI, 176 Indigenous People were murdered in 2021. Brazil is one of the most dangerous countries for environmentalists, according to a report by Global Witness. Over 17% of the entire Amazon Basin has already been deforested, and this massive destruction is pushing the forest closer to a tipping point. If 20 to 25% of the Amazon is lost, it would fail as an ecosystem, according to a research by scientists Carlos Nobre and Thomas Lovejoy. The high deforestation rate in Brazil has caused the country's carbon emissions to increase. Some 46% of the country's emissions come from deforestation. * * * Original text here: https://www.greenpeace.org.uk/news/deforestation-in-the-amazon-worse-than-ever-for-september-ahead-of-brazilian-elections/ [Category: Environment] Copyright Targeted News Services MSTRUCK-7966982 MSTRUCK"
2022-11-12,Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon breaks record in October and exceeds all of 2021,219,"The Brazilian Amazon lost 903.8 square kilometers of rainforest in October, 3% more than the same month last year and a new record for the period, according to deforestation alerts released Friday by the Brazilian Institute of Special Research (INPE). In the accumulated of the year, the most extensive rainforest on the planet also beat a new historical mark with 9,994 square kilometers of native vegetation devastated, the highest rate since 2015 when the measurement began, according to deforestation alerts released by the National Institute of Space Research (Inpe). According to the information recorded monthly by the Real-Time Legal Amazon Deforestation Detection System (Deter), the devastation of the rainforest in the first ten months of the year already exceeded that of the entire 2021, when 8,219 square kilometers of vegetation were razed. The methodology used in Deter is based on satellite images and INPE uses it to provide early warnings about areas being deforested in the Amazon. In October, 4,586 deforestation warnings were sent by the system. In the last four years, coinciding with the arrival of President Jair Bolsonar to power, deforestation in the Amazon rainforest has soared to levels not seen since 2008. Environmental organizations have warned that rampant deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon is pushing the rainforest to a point of no return. ""The moment is crucial for the Amazon, because the world's climate depends on it and, consequently, the economy, agriculture and the health of all the inhabitants of this planet. We need to get out of the realm of promises and move on to real action,"" said André Freitas, of Greenpeace Brazil, in a statement."
2022-10-07,Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon reaches record high for September,220,"Deforestation in Brazil's Amazon was the highest for a September since records began, government data from last month showed Friday, as fires in the region soared to a decade high. Satellite data from Brazil's space research agency INPE showed that 1,455 square kilometers were cleared in the Amazon last month.  Bolsonaro's responsibility  The area cleared last month in the planet's largest rainforest is 48% larger than it was in September 2021, according to data from the DETER satellite monitoring system, from the National Institute for Space Research (INPE), whose series begins in 2015. And it narrowly beats the previous record for the month of September (1,454 km2), recorded in 2019. Friday's preliminary figures also showed record deforestation for the first nine months of the year, according to INPE, with 8,590 square kilometers from January to September, equivalent to an area 11 times the size of New York City and a 22.6% increase over last year. ""The area of deforestation alerts is already 4.5% higher than that verified in all of 2021 and may equal or surpass in the three remaining months the historical record of 2019 (9,178 km2),"" the NGO Observatório do Clima said in a statement. Annual statistics released last year showed that deforestation had already soared to a 15-year high during President Jair Bolsonaro's administration. Experts blame the far-right leader, who is currently running for re-election, for rolling back environmental protections, opening the way for loggers and ranchers to illegally log more of the Amazon. During the tenure of Bolsonaro, a former Army captain, average annual deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon increased 75% compared to the previous decade. Brazil's Justice Ministry told Reuters that it has been running a police operation since last year to combat illegal deforestation and forest fires and to protect indigenous lands. ""Anyone who cares about the future of the rainforest, the lives of indigenous peoples and the possibility of having a livable planet should vote to remove Bolsonaro from the presidency on Oct. 30,"" the Observatory's executive secretary, Marcio Astrini, said in a statement. The leftist Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva won in the first round of the elections with 48% of the votes, against 43% obtained by Bolsonaro, a result that forced a runoff election. Former president Lula (2003-2010), whose environmental record is also a target of criticism, promised to increase the greenhouse gas reduction targets agreed by Brazil in the Paris Agreement, reactivate the Amazon Fund for international financing to protect the rainforest and combat deforestation, among other measures. Bolsonaro's campaign defends the legacy of the current head of state, claiming that it ""balances environmental protection with fair and sustainable economic growth.""   Impacts of deforestation The acceleration of deforestation had ""quite relevant impacts not only for the biome, but also for the region's climate and rainfall regime, as well as economic impacts for those who live in the Amazon and in Brazil as a whole,"" said Mariana Napolitano, scientific manager of WWF-Brazil. The annual fire season in the Amazon occurs in August and September, when fires tend to increase due to less rainfall, allowing ranchers and farmers to burn areas for deforestation. Last month, INPE fire alerts reached the highest monthly level since September 2010. With information from AFP and Reuters "
2022-11-11,Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon reaches record high in October ahead of government changeover,221,"By Gabriel Araujo SAO PAULO, Nov 11 (Reuters) - Deforestation in Brazil's Amazon rainforest hit a record high in October, according to data released on Friday, with land clearing in the region accelerating as the country awaits the inauguration of a more conservation-friendly government. Preliminary government data collected by space research agency Inpe showed 903.86 square kilometers were cleared in the region last month, the highest for the period since tracking began in 2015 and an increase of 3.1% year-on-year. From January to October, 9,494 square kilometers were cleared, equivalent to an area more than 12 times the size of New York City and also a record for the period, surpassing the previous high set in 2019 by 12.7%. Incoming President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has vowed to curb deforestation in the Amazon by strengthening law enforcement. He will take office on January 1 from Jair Bolsonaro, the far-right leader who has scaled back environmental protection during his term in office. Annual statistics released last year showed that deforestation had already increased to a 15-year high during Bolsonaro's term. His office and the Environment Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Mariana Napolitano, WWF-Brazil's science manager, said she expected deforestation to skyrocket during the transition period, noting how fire alerts have risen since Lula's Oct. 30 win. ""Those who profit from illegality realized that there is still a window of opportunity open, but it is about to close. Those figures are really frightening,"" he said. Fire alerts in the first 10 days of November have nearly equaled those reported for that entire month in 2021, Inpe data showed. Fire season in the Amazon, when rainfall decreases, usually occurs between August and September. (Report by Gabriel Araujo; Edited in Spanish by Javier Leira)"
2022-11-30,Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon recedes from a 15-year high,222,"By Jake Spring SAO PAULO, Nov 30 (Reuters) - Deforestation in Brazil's Amazon rainforest declined in the 12 months to July, according to government data released on Wednesday, retreating from a 15-year high it reached under outgoing President Jair Bolsonaro. Destruction was down 11% from a year earlier to 11,568 square kilometers, according to annual data from Brazilian space research agency Inpe. However, the figure is still higher than any year from 2009 to 2020. ""It's better to have a lower figure than a higher one, but it's still a very high figure, the second highest in 13 years,"" said Marcio Astrini, director of the environmental advocacy group Climate Observatory. The Amazon, the world's largest rainforest, absorbs large amounts of carbon dioxide, a gas that contributes to global warming and is released into the atmosphere through deforestation. Ane Alencar, scientific director of the Amazon Environmental Research Institute, said there has been no change in Bolsonaro's policy of weakening environmental agencies to explain the drop in deforestation. Alencar and Astrini said it was impossible to immediately know why deforestation fell, commenting that perhaps climate or economic cycles could be a factor. The annual measurement of deforestation produced by Inpe's PRODES satellite monitoring program is much more accurate than its DETER early warning system, which publishes weekly data. Forest destruction is Brazil's largest source of greenhouse gas emissions. The PRODES report, released Wednesday, is the benchmark for measuring whether Brazil is meeting its environmental and climate commitments. Average deforestation in Bolsonaro's last four years is about 60% higher than in the previous four years. Bolsonaro's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. ""We are already seeing the consequences of deforestation. There's more drought, shorter rainy seasons, an increase in fires, an increase in temperatures,"" said Mariana Napolitano, scientific director of the nonprofit WWF-Brazil.

2022-10-07,Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon sets a record in September,224,"Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon was 1,455 km2 in September, a record for this month of the year, according to official data this Friday (7), less than a month before the second round of the presidential elections, in which Jair Bolsonaro seeks reelection. The area deforested last month in the largest tropical forest on the planet is 48% greater than that of September 2021, according to data from the satellite monitoring system DETER, of the National Institute for Space Research (Inpe), whose series begins in 2015. And it slightly surpasses the previous record for the month of September (1,454 km2), recorded in 2019. ""In the year-to-date, since January, the area of deforestation alerts until September is already 4.5% greater than that verified until December 2021, and may equal or surpass in the remaining three months the historical record of 2019 (9,178 km2),"" said in a statement the NGO Observatório do Clima, which advocates the exit of Bolsonaro from power. ""Anyone who cares about the future of the forest, the lives of indigenous peoples, and the possibility of us having a habitable planet should vote to eliminate Bolsonaro from the presidency on the 30th,"" Observatory executive secretary Marcio Astrini said in a statement. During Bolsonaro's administration, average annual deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon - caused mainly by cutting down trees to make way for cattle and farmland, according to experts - increased by 75% over the previous decade."
2022-10-28,Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon sets new record under Bolsonaro,225,"Rio de Janeiro, Oct. 28. Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon, in just over nine months, already exceeded by 12.9% that of the entire 2021 and, without ending the year, is a new record for the country, the second under the government of the far-right Jair Bolsonaro, according to official data released Friday. Until October 21 this year, the most extensive rainforest on the planet had lost 9,277 square kilometers of native vegetation, the highest rate since 2015 when the measurement began, according to deforestation alerts released by the National Institute of Space Research (Inpe). The highest number of alerts so far had been recorded in 2019, during Bolsonaro's first year in office, when 9,178 square kilometers of forest were devastated. The data correspond to the Real-Time Legal Amazon Deforestation Detection System (Deter) which, based on satellite images, provides early warnings about areas being deforested in the Amazon. This system captures monthly deforestation alarms in Brazil and differs from Prodes, which, with a more sophisticated technique, obtains more detailed information, but only issues it annually, between August and July of the following year, considered the reference period for measuring devastation in the country. DEVASTATION ""OUT OF CONTROL For environmentalists, the issue is nothing new, since under the current government deforestation ""is absolutely out of control in the Amazon"", according to Marcio Astrini, executive secretary of the Climate Observatory, a network that brings together about 80 environmental NGOs in Brazil, including Greenpeace and WWF. ""There is no action by the federal government to curb deforestation in the Amazon. It is not a concern of the Bolsonaro government to reduce it,"" he said. For the expert, the problem is that environmental crimes in the rainforest have never had such a favorable scenario as the current one where there is ""much comfort"" for criminals. The Brazilian president defends the exploitation of natural resources in the Amazon, even in indigenous reserves, where it is prohibited by law, and since he came to power, the rates of devastation in the jungle have increased by 73%. NEGATIVE LEGACY The situation in which the Brazilian Amazon is immersed cannot be reversed in the short term and the governor who takes office in 2023 will have a ""very high"" negative legacy, according to Astrini, since he will inherit five months with very high deforestation rates (the reference year for measuring deforestation begins in August). ""In August we had an increase in alerts of 81%, in September of 48% and everything indicates that in October we are going to have the highest number in the historical series,"" Astrini indicated. Bolsonaro aspires to be reelected this Sunday in the second round, but former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is the favorite with 49 % of the voting intention, against 44 % of the ultra-right leader, according to the polls."
2022-11-30,"Deforestation in the Legal Amazon dropped 11% last year, says Inpe",226,"The Project for Monitoring Deforestation in the Legal Amazon by Satellite (Prodes), from the National Institute for Space Research (Inpe), which monitors annual deforestation rates in the Legal Amazon, indicated on Wednesday (30/11), that between 2021 and 2022 deforestation in the region fell 11%. The destruction in the area that includes the states of Acre, Amapá, Amazonas, Mato Grosso, Pará, Rondônia, Roraima, Tocantins and part of Maranhão went from 13038 km² last year to 11568 km². Among the states with the highest rate of felled forest this year, Pará has 4,141.00 km² of area with this profile, in the accumulated, since the beginning of monitoring, in 1988, this meant 34.61%. However, the deforestation rate in one year also registered a drop of 21%. Other locations also registered drops, the largest of which was in Amapá, which went from 17km² to six km² of area. In Tocantins the register went from 37km² to 27 km² of deforested area, the equivalent to a 27% decrease. In Roraima, the area went from 315 km² to 240 km², a reduction of 24%. Amazonas, the second federative unit of the Legal Amazon with the largest deforested area, from 2,607 km² in total in 2020, increased by 13% - the only state that registered growth. The rates are made available annually, with the first (about 50% of the processing) delivered in December, from the increments of satellite images that identify deforestation in the eight Brazilian states. In 2009, Brazil's National Plan on Climate Change stipulated a deforestation reduction target for 2020 of 3,925 km². However, the reality is that today deforestation is three times greater than what was agreed upon in the plan. Commitment to reduction  The area devastated in 2022 in the Amazon is 48.2% higher than the average observed in the last 10 years in the biome. Raul do Valle, Public Policy specialist at the World Wide Fund for Nature Brazil (WWF Brazil) calls attention to the dismantling of the environmental protection system that occurred under the administration of Jair Bolsonaro (PL) and how this could lead to the approach of a point of no return - that in which the forest loses the ability to provide ecosystem services. ""The new government needs to send a clear signal that no deforestation will be tolerated and to rebuild the entire framework of protection that has been destroyed. This path is vital for Brazil to guarantee its climate security and resume its leadership role in environmental issues on the international stage"", Valle evaluated. Marcelo Furtado, member of the Brazilian Coalition for Climate, Forests and Agriculture, reminds that this fight doesn't need to be invented, since there are already public policies that, when implemented, can significantly contain deforestation. He points out that besides the president, attention should also focus on the decisions that will come out of the National Congress. ""It's a shot in the foot. Who suffers most from this lack of responsibility is, on the one hand, the Brazilian citizen, who loses his environmental assets. Also the environment, which loses its capacity to generate water and climate control. And, obviously, the economy, because of the impact caused to agricultural production and energy generation,"" said the specialist."
2022-11-30,"Deforestation in the Legal Amazon fell last year, but rose 60% under Bolsonaro",227,"The deforested area in the Legal Amazon decreased 11% in 12 months, until July, according to official data released on Wednesday (30), which show, however, a total advance of 60% during the government of Jair Bolsonaro. Between August 2021 and July 2022, 11,568 km² of the rainforest were deforested, an area equivalent to the territory of Qatar, according to the Project for Monitoring Deforestation in the Legal Amazon by Satellite (Prodes), of the National Institute for Space Research (Inpe). This represents a drop of 11.3% with respect to the period from August 2020 to July 2021, when Inpe detected 13,083 km² deforested, a record in 15 years. But when considering the last four years, the data reveal that during Bolsonaro's government the average annual deforestation rose 59.5% compared to the previous four years. It also advanced 75.5 percent compared to the previous decade. ""The Bolsonaro regime has been a forest destruction machine (...) The only good news from the current government is its end,"" Marcio Astrini, executive secretary of the Climate Observatory, said in a statement. President-elect Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who beat Bolsonaro in the October elections, has promised to work to eliminate the destruction of the Amazon. ""The devastation continues out of control. Jair Bolsonaro will leave his successor a cursed legacy of rising deforestation and a conflagrated Amazon,"" Astrini added. The environmentalist called on Lula - whose legacy on the environment between 2003 and 2010 has been subject to criticism - to adopt a policy of ""zero tolerance"" for environmental crimes. Lula, who attended the UN climate conference in Egypt (COP27), promised to increase the greenhouse gas reduction targets agreed to by Brazil in the Paris Agreement, and to reactivate the internationally funded Amazon Fund, among other environmental measures. Experts attribute the deforestation mainly to the felling of trees to make room for pastures for cattle or agricultural crops. Bolsonaro is accused by environmentalists of having weakened protection programs and promoted destruction, with his defense of mining and economic exploitation of protected areas. The Amazon corresponds to 59% of Brazilian territory, divided among nine states. Its preservation is considered vital in the fight against climate change. ""The Amazon [is] getting closer and closer to its point of no return,"" Mariana Napolitano, Science Manager at WWF-Brazil, said in a statement. ""It is essential and feasible to significantly reduce deforestation rates until they are completely eliminated by 2030. This is a humanitarian imperative in the face of the dual climate crisis and the massive loss of global biodiversity that humanity is facing,"" she said."
2022-11-09,Deforestation is pushing Amazon to 'point of no return': WWF report,228,"Nov 09, 2022( Mongabay News: http://news.mongabay.com Delivered by Newstex)   A new report from the World Wildlife Fund, called the Living Amazon Report, warns that threats to the Amazon have gotten worse in recent years, and could result in the disappearance of the biome if more drastic action isn't taken.Around 18% of Amazon forests are lost and another 17% are highly degraded, the report said.If more drastic action isn't taken, the report said the biome could transition from forest to savanna and push global warming above the safe threshold of 1.5C. Deforestation is pushing the Amazon rainforest dangerously close to its tipping point, and the effects could soon be felt across the globe.  A new report[1] from the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), called the Living Amazon Report, warns that threats to the Amazon have worsened in recent years, and could result in the disappearance of the biome altogether if more drastic action isn't taken soon.  'The situation has begun to show signs of nearing a point of no return: seasons are changing, surface water is being lost, rivers are becoming increasingly disconnected and polluted, and forests are under immense pressure from increasingly devastating waves of deforestation and fire,' the report said. 'This could lead to irreversible change in the near future.'  The report was presented at COP27 in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, where the international community is discussing the implementation of policies to prevent climate change.  Cattle ranching, agriculture, land grabbing, fires and speculation have contributed to the loss of 18% of Amazon forests and the high degradation of another 17%, the report said. At the same time, pollution from mining and agriculture, and the introduction of non-native species are increasingly destabilizing the region's freshwater ecosystems.  There are currently more than 600 infrastructure projects operating along rivers in the Amazon, the report said, with twenty road projects being planned and over 400 dams operating or in the planning stage. Meanwhile, mining operations continue to clear forest and dump harmful chemicals like mercury into the water, the report said.  Around 12.2 million square kilometers (4.7 million square miles) of the rainforest were cleared last year, according to PRODES, a satellite project monitoring deforestation.  More frequent and intense fires in the Amazon threaten the stability of this key ecosystem for people, wildlife, and climate. Image by Christian Braga/ Greenpeace.  As a result, the biome is nearing its 'tipping point,' meaning it could soon transition from wet rainforest to dry savanna, and would become unable to sustain its current biodiversity. The Amazon region in Brazil and Bolivia is already showing clear signs of savannization, another recent report showed[2], with Colombia, Ecuador and Peru going in the same direction. Some studies say[3] the tipping point lies somewhere around 25% forest cover loss. But according to the WWF report, it could also be less than that.  'There is no scientific consensus on the exact probability of reaching a point of no return because we do not know enough about some complex ecosystem factors,' the report said. 'It is known, however, that the probability increases with greater deforestation, degradation and climate change.'  Reaching the tipping point could drastically alter the lives of the 47 million people who live and work in the Amazon region, the report said, among them more than 500 Indigenous groups. It would also have regional and even global implications, since the rainforest would be unable to serve its ecological function as a recycler of water and air pollution.  The Amazon recycles up to 75% of moisture. But if deforestation continues, there won't be enough forest left to carry out that function, leading to a drop in precipitation, an extended dry season and a water deficit.  That dryness would mean an increase in fires and even more forest loss.. The Amazon stores as much as 733 Gt of carbon dioxide, and releasing much of it into the atmosphere would likely contribute to pushing global temperature increase above the 1.5C safety threshold, the report explained.  'Urgent action is needed to avoid global repercussions and to ensure that this region can continue to regulate the planet's climate and to provide environmental and cultural benefits to the world,' said Roberto Troya, Regional Director for WWF Latin America and the Caribbean.  Drastic times, drastic measures  According to the WWF report, it's not too late to stop deforestation from pushing the Amazon past its tipping point. But it's going to take massive collaboration from governments, civil society, the private sector and Indigenous communities, among other important stakeholders to make it happen.  The report advocated for the COICA-led 'Amazon for Life' initiative to conserve at least 80% of Amazon forests by 2025.  Aerial view of Amazon rainforest landscape scarred by open pit gold mines. Image by Rhett A. Butler.  The forestry and agricultural industry, banks and governments must work together, the report said, to monitor whether supply chains are contributing to deforestation. Beef, soy and other agricultural products have been found to clear primary forest without punishment because traceability systems aren't always rigorous enough.  'Some companies are working harder than others to follow their own money,' said Kelly McNamara, a senior research and policy analyst in the International Climate and Agriculture Finance Program.  Existing protected areas, many of which are under threat of being downgraded to allow for infrastructure development, will require complex management plans that involve better monitoring and reporting by local communities and officials.  A strong sustainable forest management, in which forestry products are harvested without contributing to forest degradation, will also ensure the long-term health of forests while helping to combat illegal logging, the WWF report said.  The report stressed that Indigenous peoples are key to carrying out virtually all of these initiatives, as their livelihoods are often connected to their territories' ecosystems. Fishing, ancestral agricultural systems, tourism and other cultural practices, it said, make Indigenous people critical players in protecting the Amazon in the future.  'Indigenous communities have been stewards of the land for hundreds of years, thousands of years,' McNamara said about the importance the report places on Indigenous communities. 'They certainly have a critical role to play in preserving the native vegetation and keeping the biodiversity across the Amazon and cerrado in check.'

2022-12-13,"Deforestation Of Amazon Rainforest Increased Even After Lula Election, COP27 Climate Talks",229,"Dec 13, 2022( Latin Times: http://www.latintimes.com Delivered by Newstex)   Despite the election of Luiz Incio Lula da Silva, who has made his pro-environmental policies clear during the U.N. climate talks in Egypt last month, the deforestation of the Amazon rainforest is reported to have increased sharply during the month of November.  Surveillance from Brazil's national space institute showed that over 214 square miles were cleared during the month of November, said to be 60% above the month's average deforestation and more than double the amount that occurred the November of last year, according to Mongbay[1].  Most concerning during this time period are aerial photographs of what environmentalists are calling the 'Road to Chaos,' a 75-mile road carved in the middle of an indigenous territory in Brazil's Amazon that's reportedly focused on smuggling excavators to the protected lands of the Yanomami, The Guardian[2] reported.  The size of the destruction was described by Greenpeace environmentalist Danicley de Aguiar as the group shows the havoc to journalists, which include four excavators working on digging through the Yanomami's lands for gold.  Indigenous leader Sônia Guajajara claimedthat these politically-connected mining gangs had used everyone's focus on the recent Presidential elections to smuggle the excavators in, which was seen destroying nearby territory during the reconnaissance mission of the environmentalists.  The wildcat prospectors of gold, called the garimpeiros, were initially encouraged to mine on the lands of the Yanomami before international pressure forced the government to convert it to protected lands. But as lax enforcement and soaring gold prices continued during the past decade, many were enticed to return to the protected lands to dig for gold.  'It's astonishing. You're in the lap of this great forest and it's almost as if you're in one those old films about ancient EgyptAll those monstrous machines destroying the earth to make money,' photographer Joo Laet said.  The overall deforestation happening in the Amazon appeared to have increased this year to 10,049 square kilometers in the past 11months, considered the largest amount of loss in the Amazon since at least 2008.  Many are hoping to reverse course on the Amazon's destruction now that Lula da Silva has been elected president. His first two terms in office presided over a significant decline in the destruction of the rainforest,and he has made promises during the campaign and during the COP27 climate talks in Egypt to lessen the deforestation and help take care of the Amazon.

2022-11-30,"Deforestation of the Amazon increased 59% under Bolsonaro, says Inpe",230,"In one year, the Brazilian Amazon registered 11,568 km² of deforestation, a rate that puts measurements during the government of Jair Bolsonaro (PL) with a negative record: a 59.5% increase in the deforestation rate in the Amazon compared to the previous four years. The data are from Prodes, which is part of Inpe (National Institute for Space Research), and are part of a monitoring of 108 satellite images of clear cut deforestation in the Legal Amazon between August 1, 2021 and July 31, 2022. In relation to the values for the same period in the 2020-2021 biennium, there was a reduction of 11.27%. Even so, the index is the highest, excluding the previous year, since 2008. Among the states of the Legal Amazon, Pará was the state most responsible for the negative result - 4,141 km² were deforested in 2022, 21% less than in the previous year. However, the highlight was the state of Amazonas, the only one to register an increase in destruction: the satellites captured 2,607 km² of deforestation, an increase of 13%. For the Climate Observatory, a group that brings together environmental organizations in Brazil, one of the justifications is the ""expected paving of the BR-319 highway (Manaus-Porto Velho), a highway that cuts through the largest block of intact Amazon forest"", in addition to the reduction of Ibama's effective work in the field. See deforestation rates by state for the 2021-2022 biennium: Acre: 847 km² Amazonas: 2,607 km² Amapá: 6 km² Maranhão: 282 km². Mato Grosso: 1,906 km². Pará: 4,141 km² Rondônia: 1,512 km² Roraima: 240 km² Tocantins: 27 km² Total deforestation in 2021-2022: 11,568 km². Inheritance of Bolsonaro. With the near end of the Bolsonaro government, the president's legacy regarding deforestation is historical, but by the negative sense. The president became the leader with the largest increase in deforestation recorded since 1988, when the historical series of Prodes begins. ""If he wants to see forest destruction numbers decrease by 2023, Lula will have to have zero tolerance for environmental crime from the first day of his administration. And that includes holding those who sabotaged environmental governance in the country while in government over the past four years accountable,"" said Márcio Astrini, executive secretary of the Climate Observatory."
2022-12-02,"Despite 11% drop in 2022, Amazon deforestation rate has soared under Bolsonaro",231,"Dec 02, 2022( Mongabay News: http://news.mongabay.com Delivered by Newstex)   An area equivalent to the size of Qatar was cleared in the Brazilian Amazon between Aug. 1, 2021, and July 31, 2022, according to data from the country's National Space Research Institute (INPE).Although the figure represents an 11.27% decrease in the Amazon annual deforestation rate compared with the prior year, the government of President Bolsonaro still accounts for the most Amazon destruction in the last 34 years, environmentalists say.Bolsonaro's four-year term ends with a 59.5% boom in Amazon deforestation rates, the highest in a presidential term since 1988, when measurements by satellite imagery began.INPE's report, dated Nov. 3 but only released 27 days later, also triggered criticism among environmentalists, who accused the Bolsonaro's administration of omitting the annual deforestation data until the end of the UN conference on climate change, COP27, held Nov. 6-20 in Egypt. Annual deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon dropped 11.27% compared with the prior year, official data show. But the government of President Bolsonaro still accounts for the most Amazon destruction in the last 34 years, environmentalists say.  Between Aug. 1, 2021, and July 31, 2022, an area of 11,568 square kilometers (4,466 square miles) — equivalent to the size of Qatar — was cleared, according to preliminary analysis of satellite imagery[1] released Nov. 30 by the country's National Space Research Institute (INPE). The deforestation for the prior period (Aug. 1, 2020, to July 31, 2021) was 13,038 km2 (5,034 mi2), the highest since 2006[2].  Since Bolsonaro took office in January 2019, he has dismantled environmental agencies and slashed budgets for operations to fight environmental crimes. He also has pushed an anti-environmental and anti-Indigenous agenda in Congress, dubbed the 'death package[3].'  As a result, his four-year term ends with a 59.5% boom in Amazon deforestation rates, the highest in a presidential term since 1988, when measurements by satellite imagery began, according to the Observatório do Clima, or the Climate Observatory, a network of Brazilian civil society organizations advocating for climate action.  'The Bolsonaro regime was a forest-burning machine. The outgoing President was sworn in with deforestation at 7,500 km2 and is stepping out with 11,500 km2. The only good news here is precisely that he is stepping out,' Marcio Astrini, executive secretary of the Climate Observatory said[4] in a news release.  The state of Amazonas was the only one that showed an increase in deforestation rates (2,607 km2 or 13.05%), INPE data show, while Amap state accounted for the highest percentage of deforestation rate reduction (6 km2 or 64.71%). On the other hand, although Par recorded a 20.94% decrease in its deforestation rate, the state remains the largest absolute contributor to Amazon deforestation with 4,141 km2 (1,599 mi2) alone in 2022, INPE noted.  INPE's report, dated Nov. 3 but only released 27 days later, also triggered criticism among environmentalists. 'As in 2021, Jair Bolsonaro's administration continued opting to omit the annual deforestation data until the end of the UN conference on climate change, COP27, held between November 6 and 20, in Egypt,' Greenpeace said in a news release. 'The attitude is one more of the actions of the federal government that seek to camouflage its vexatious legacy of much destruction.'  NGOs urge recently elected President Lula to take immediate measures to tackle deforestation in the Amazon. 'If Lula wants to see the numbers of forest destruction decrease in 2023, he will have to have zero tolerance with environmental crime since day one in office. And that includes bringing to justice those who sabotaged environmental governance in the country while occupying the government in the last four years,' said Astrini.

2022-10-31,"During Bolsonaro's presidency, 73% of deforestation in the Amazon occurred.",232,"Alt On October 30, 2022, the second round of presidentialelections was held in Brazil, in order to choose between the current president JairBolsonaro or the former president LuizLula da Silva. These elections, in which Lula won, are also relevant for the rest of the world because, during Bolsonaro's presidential term, Greenpeace mentioned that Brazil had an environmental dismantling. According to Greenpeace Brazil's article The truth about the Amazon under Bolsonaro's government: ""Bolsonaro's administration has made a daily effort to destroy the natural heritage of Brazilians"". For the average deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon in the first three years of his government (2019-2021) compared to the previous three years (2016 -2018), increased 52.9 percent. Amazonia is the largest tropical rainforest in the world, according to the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) this region is home to 10% of known biodiversity. In addition, its rivers represent between 15 and 16% of the total riverdischarge to the world's oceans. WWF declares the Amazon Biome as ""virtually unparalleled"", considering that the Amazon River flows for more than 6,600 km. The river is home to about 85% of the fish species in South America. Moreover, the Amazon contains between 90 and 140 billion metric tons of carbon, according to WWF. While the Brazilian Forestry Institute stated that 30 million animal species live in the Amazon, including more than a thousand types of birds. However, the largest rainforest in the world was affected during 2019 and 2021 by the deforestation of 13,235 km² in the biome. In the article published by Greenpeace, on October 28, 2022 manifests some actions, which increased the lack of care for the environment. The first is the favoring of the Ministry of the Environment, headed by RicardoSalles, towards the logging, mining and civil construction sectors. The above with the creation of norms that did not need to pass through Congress, which made them unlawful, according to the civil organization. Among these norms are: Allowing the sale of timber without proof of origin. Construction on mangroves and sandbanks Amnesty for deforesters  Ricardo Salles on June 23, 2021, left as a legacy ""two years of high deforestation, two successive records of fires in the Amazon"". As well as ""26% of the Pantanal burned and the international image of the country in mud"", declares Greenpeace Brazil. Despite the fact that, during his campaign, Bolsonaro promisednot todemarcate ""one centimeter"" of indigenous land, Greenpeace exposes the alliances of the Brazilian president with the ruralists in Congress and the attempt to do away with indigenous lands. By 2020 he sent to Congress Bill 191/2020, which opened up indigenous lands for mineral and energy exploration. And with what is mentioned in the article, with data from MapBiomas, between 2019 and 2020 in these territories were opened the largest miningareas since the 1980s, multiplying tenfold in the period the destruction of forests for illegalmining. Bolsonaro's government ""censored the investigations of officials in the environmental area and discredited the scientists responsible for the deforestation data"", indicates the civil association. It also speaks of the 2021 budget allocated to the environment as the lowest in the last 21 years . In addition, it handed over to the ArmedForces the actions against deforestation, resulting in 73% of damage in the Amazon. Norway and Germanysuspended donations to the Amazon Fund, following the Brazilian president's proposal to use this money as compensation to occupants of public lands. Meanwhile, the Minister of Economy, PauloGuedes, defended at the World Economic Forum a backward, toxic and exclusionary model of agriculture, according to Greenpeace. Moreover, Brazil opposed a global agreement for the protection of biodiversity in the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity. Bolsonaro's campaign plans regarding the environmental issue did not change, as he proposed to continue with the allocation of budget to the Armed Forces to safeguard the environment. This action brought him criticism from environmentalists, who complained about the lack of positive results in his current governorship. Luiz Inácio Lula Da Silva, during his campaign, declared to fight illegalmining, fires and deforestation in the Amazon rainforest. In addition to strengthening the preservation and control organs, weakened during Bolsonaro's administration. During his administration, he intends to recover the resources of the Amazon Fund and reduce the greenhouse gas emissions assumed in the Paris Agreement."
2022-11-18,Ending Amazon deforestation: 4 essential reads about the future of the world's largest rainforest,233,"Brazil's president-elect, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, was greeted with applause and cheers when he addressed the U.N. climate conference in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, on Nov. 16, 2022. As he had in his campaign, Lula pledged to stop rampant deforestation in the Amazon, which his predecessor, Jair Bolsanaro, had encouraged.  Forests play a critical role in slowing climate change by taking up carbon dioxide, and the Amazon rainforest absorbs one-fourth of the CO2 absorbed by all the land on Earth. These articles from The Conversation's archive examine stresses on the Amazon and the Indigenous groups who live there. 1. Massive losses The Amazon rainforest is vast, covering some 2.3 million square miles (6 million square kilometers). It extends over eight countries, with about 60% of it in Brazil. And the destruction occurring there is also enormous.  From 2010 to 2019, the Amazon lost 24,000 square miles (62,000 square kilometers) of forest - the equivalent of about 10.3 million U.S. football fields. Much of this land was turned into cattle ranches, farms and palm oil plantations. ""There are a number of reasons why this deforestation matters - financial, environmental and social,"" wrote Washington University in St. Louis data scientist Liberty Vittert, explaining why she and other judges chose Amazon deforestation as the Royal Statistical Society's International Statistic of the Decade.  Forest clearance in the region threatens people, wild species and freshwater supplies along with the climate. ""The farmers, commercial interest groups and others looking for cheap land all have a clear vested interest in deforestation going ahead, but any possible short-term gain is clearly outweighed by long-term loss,"" Vittert concluded. À lire aussi : Statistic of the decade: The massive deforestation of the Amazon 2. Legalizing land grabs Much of the Amazon has been under state control for decades. In the 1970s, Brazil's military government started encouraging farmers and miners to move into the region to spur economic development, while also setting some zones aside for conservation. More recently, however, Brazil's government has made it easier for wealthy interests to seize large swaths of land - including in conservation areas and Indigenous territories. Reviewing national laws and land holdings, University of Florida geographers Gabriel Cardoso Carrero, Cynthia S. Simmons and Robert T. Walker found that Brazil's National Congress was expanding the legal size of private holdings in the Amazon even before Bolsonaro was elected in 2019.  In southern Amazonas state, Amazonia's most active deforestation frontier, rates of deforestation started to rise in 2012 because of loosened regulatory oversight. The number and size of clearings that the researchers identified using satellite data increased after Bolsonaro took office. ""Because of policy interventions and the greening of agricultural supply chains, deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon fell after 2005, reaching a low point in 2012, when it began trending up again because of weakening environmental governance and reduced surveillance,"" they observed. ""In our view, the global community can help by insisting that supply chains for Amazonian beef and soybean products originate on lands deforested long ago and whose legality is long-standing.""

Indigenous resistance Road building in the Amazon, which increased dramatically during Bolsonaro's tenure, brings development and related threats like wildfires into wild areas. University of Richmond geographer David Salisbury also saw it as an existential threat to Indigenous communities.  Indigenous residents of the Brazilian-Peruvian borderlands where Salisbury worked ""understand that the loggers and their tractors and chainsaws are the sharp point of a road allowing coca growers, land traffickers and others access to traditional Indigenous territories and resources,"" Salisbury reported. ""They also realize that their Indigenous communities may be all that stands in defense of the forest and stops invaders and road builders."" Several Indigenous women won office as federal deputies in Brazil's recent elections, and Lula has pledged to protect Indigenous people's rights. Salisbury saw it as crucial to ensure that Indigenous defenders of the Amazon receive ""the support and educational opportunities needed to be safe, prosperous and empowered to protect their rainforest home.""

Five global deforestation drivers: Beef, soy, palm oil, wood - and crime A small handful of highly lucrative commodities are the main causes of deforestation in the Amazon and other tropical regions around the world. In Brazil, much of the land is cleared for raising beef cattle or cultivating soy. In Indonesia and Malaysia, palm oil production is spurring large-scale rainforest destruction. Wood production, for pulp and paper products as well as fuel, is also a major driver in Asia and Africa. ""Making the supply chains for these four commodities more sustainable is an important strategy for reducing deforestation,"" wrote Texas State University geographer Jennifer Devine. But Devine also found a fifth factor interwoven with these four industries: organized crime. ""Large, lucrative industries offer opportunities to move and launder money; as a result, in many parts of the world, deforestation is driven by the drug trade,"" she reported. In the Amazon, for example, drug traffickers are illegally logging forests and hiding cocaine in timber shipments to Europe.  ""Promoting sustainable production and consumption are critical to halting deforestation worldwide. But in my view, national and industry leaders also have to root organized crime and illicit markets out of these commodity chains,"" Devine concluded.

2022-11-30,ENVIRONMENT - French banks accused of 'massively' fuelling Amazon deforestation,234,"French banks are ""massively"" financing deforestation in the Amazon rainforest and tropical Cerrado savanna – providing hundreds of millions of euros to Brazilian agribusiness giants responsible for driving forest loss over the past decade, a coalition of NGOs and media outlets has warned. BNP Paribas, Société Générale, Crédit Agricole and the Banque Populaire et Caisse d'Epargne group are accused of contributing to the razing of 9,500 square metres of vegetation cleared to create land for soy, palm oil and beef farming. A report published Monday by investigative news sites Disclose and Reporter Brasil – in partnership with the NGOs Sherpa, Harvest and the Centre for Climate Crime Analysis – found the banks had invested more than 743 million euros in ventures linked to deforestation between 2013 and 2022. BNP Paribas singled out At the top of that list was BNP Paribas, singled out as the largest French financial supporter of the sector – and the country's ""leading bank for deforestation"". ""Between January 2021 and September 2022 alone, BNP Paribas invested nearly 117 million euros in the activities of several agribusiness giants directly involved in the deforestation of the Amazon and the Cerrado,"" the report said. ""This financing is carried out despite promises and commitments made in favour of the environment."" In February 2021, BNP pledged to stop investing in firms contributing to clearing tropical forest for beef or soybean production in the Amazon and Cerrado, and to only fund companies with zero deforestation strategies by 2025. The report alleges this promise was not met. French supermarket giant Casino sued over links to Amazon deforestation As part of its investigation, the coalition analysed thousands of financial transactions – corporate loans, bonds, equity investments and share issues – tracked by the Forest and Finance platform, which assesses the finance received by hundreds of companies involved in the beef, soy, palm oil, pulp, paper, rubber and timber supply chains. Agribusiness giants named in the report include Bunge and Cargill, both American, and Brazilian companies Minerva, Marfrig and JBS. The latter, the world's top beef producer, is accused of illegally shipping meat from farms that have been banned by both Brazil and the European Union. Duty of vigilance law Since February 2017, a corporate ""duty of vigilance"" law opens French businesses up to potential legal action for human rights violations and environmental damage linked to their supply chains. ""BNP Paribas is the first bank to invest in the Amazon,"" said Jean-Philippe Foegle, a lawyer and advocacy officer at Sherpa, adding French companies were bound by law to monitor their foreign activities. Cop27 climate summit charts small path for global food justice ""What the duty of vigilance and anti-money laundering legislation provides for is that when you have a suspicion that the actor you are financing is involved in illegal activities, you must ensure that you do not finance that actor,"" he said. In response, BNP Paribas told RFI it had made strict commitments to protect the environment and it would take time for those practices to be implemented on the ground. Sherpa says it is considering legal action to force banks to follow through on their commitments. Radio France Internationale - All rights of reproduction and distribution reserved. "
2023-01-07,Every year 10 million hectares of forest are destroyed worldwide,235," In 2022, some 786,000 hectares of forest were burned in the EU and 28 million tons of CO? were released into the atmosphere. Photo: (EPA) EFE - Raphael AlvesEvery year some 10 million hectares of forests are destroyed, an area larger than the size of Portugal and equivalent to that of Iceland, according to the UN, which points to this ""alarming"" global deforestation, along with agriculture and other land use changes, as responsible for 25% of global greenhouse gas emissions. (See: Infographic: How has biodiversity changed over time?) According to the latest report from the UN-REDD Programme, the United Nations Environment Programme World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC) and the Green Gigaton Challenge (GGC) initiative, the world is not on track to achieve the forest goals of ending and reversing deforestation by 2030, a key aspiration for progress towards the Paris Agreement target of 1.5° Celsius . The report concludes that, for the 2030 targets to be achievable, the milestone of one gigatonne equivalent in emissions reversed by forests must be reached by 2025 at the latest. Deforestation of the AmazonPrecisely climate defense in general and reversing the deforestation of the Amazon in particular was one of the banners of the campaign that brought to power the new president of Brazil, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who plans to convene a summit this year with the presidents of the eleven countries that share the planet's largest plant lung . His commitment is to reestablish measures to combat deforestation in the Amazon abandoned by his predecessor in office, Jair Bolsonaro, during whose mandate forest destruction increased by almost 60%, with an average area devastated of 11,396 square kilometers per year. (Read: Marina Silva, defender of the Brazilian Amazon who repeats as Minister of the Environment) Forest firesForest fires are among the causes of deforestation, which, in addition to destroying forests and biodiversity, release large quantities of CO? into the atmosphere . By way of example, in 2022 some 786,000 hectares of forest were burned in the EU, 39% of them in Spain, and 28 million tons of CO? were released into the atmosphere. Figures similar to those in other parts of the world in a particularly virulent year: the outbreaks of fires at the beginning of 2022 in the northeastern Argentine province of Corrientes devastated 785,000 hectares, and in Bolivia 854,724 hectares burned up to September alone. Global greenhouse gas emissionsWith this scenario, the UN believes that limiting the average global temperature increase to 1.5°C will be impossible without forests playing a major role, both in terms of the massive emissions reductions that can be achieved by halting deforestation and the additional carbon that can be sequestered through improved forest management and reforestation . Their calculations indicate that eliminating emissions from deforestation and increasing carbon removals by promoting forest regeneration and landscape restoration could reduce global net emissions by up to 30% and, over the next decade, forests could provide up to 50% of the cost-effective mitigation available. That target is a long way off, however, considering that between about 10 million hectares of forests are destroyed each year, deforestation that is responsible for about 25% of global greenhouse gas emissions, along with agriculture and other land-use changes. ""Deforestation and land degradation also undermine efforts to build resilience to climate impacts and threaten forest-dwelling communities,"" the UN laments.

2023-01-17,Former director of Inpe is the new president of CNPq,236,"The scientist Ricardo Galvão will be the new president of the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq). The appointment was made this Tuesday (17) by the Minister of Science, Technology and Innovation, Luciana Santos, in a ceremony in Brasília (DF). The researcher will be responsible for coordinating the area of funding research grants for undergraduate and graduate students. Galvão was director of the National Institute for Space Research (Inpe) from 2016 to 2019. The scientist was exonerated by former president Jair Bolsonaro (PL) after releasing data on deforestation in the Amazon. At the time, Bolsonaro's government criticized information from the institute that showed increased deforestation in July 2019. Bolsonaro and members of the government claimed that the data was wrong and its release damaged Brazil's image and affected trade agreements. Ricardo Galvão is a full professor at the Institute of Physics at the University of São Paulo (USP). He was designated as one of the ten most important people for science by Nature Magazine in 2019. In 2021, Galvão received the Scientific Freedom and Responsibility Award from the American Association for the Advancement of Science.

2023-02-27,French bank BNP Paribas accused of financing deforestation in Brazil,237,"Several NGOs have filed a lawsuit against French bank BNP Paribas, denouncing it for financing Marfrig, a Brazilian agribusiness giant, accused of contributing to deforestation, land grabbing and forced labor - the plaintiffs announced on Monday (27). Filed by Brazilian NGO Comissão Pastoral da Terra (CPT) and French association Notre Affaire À Tous in a Paris court, the complaint was unveiled four days after BNP Paribas was sued by three other environmental defense associations for its ""significant contribution"" to global warming by its oil and gas clients. It follows a formal notice issued in late October by CPT and Notre Affaire à Tous, requesting that BNP Paribas end its financial support for Marfrig, Brazil's second largest meatpacker. According to both organizations, the company ""would have been responsible for more than 120,000 hectares of illegal deforestation in the Amazon forest and the Cerrado savannah"" between 2009 and 2020. The associations accuse BNP Paribas of having violated the French law on duty of vigilance. The law requires multinationals headquartered in France to establish a plan, ""including reasonable surveillance measures to identify risks and prevent serious violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms, people's health and safety, and the environment, resulting from the activities of the company and the companies it controls"" in France and abroad. ""Despite its commitments and its communications (...), the accumulating evidence of BNP's support for Marfrig and Marfrig's lack of vigilance towards its suppliers reveal the inadequacy of the measures taken by BNP. We cannot close our eyes to deforestation and forced labor and pretend to be an actor of change and carbon neutrality,"" argued Jérémie Suissa, the general delegate of Notre Affaire à Tous, in a statement released on Monday. Contacted by AFP, the BNP said it ""regrets"" that the NGOs seek ""the path of litigation rather than dialogue. The bank also said it demands that ""by 2025 its clients have a 'zero deforestation' strategy in their production and supply chains, as well as full traceability of supply chains (direct and indirect) in beef and soy from the Brazilian Amazon and Cerrado,"" adding that it ""will no longer provide products, or financial services, to companies that are not aligned with this policy.""

2022-11-29,French banks accused of financing deforestation of the Amazon and Cerrado,238,"A partnership between two media platforms and three NGOs released a report on Monday (28) accusing several French banks of financing agribusiness giants operating in Brazil, disregarding their environmental commitments and financing the deforestation of the Amazon and Cerrado. The destruction of the Amazon forest broke all records in 2022, with about 9,500 km² of forest devastated. In the Cerrado, the destruction registered an increase of more than 28% in the first seven months of this year, according to data released in August by the National Institute for Space Research (Inpe), compared with the same period in 2021. In most cases, the devastation of these two of the largest Brazilian biomes occurs due to intensive agriculture, destined to the cultivation of soy, palm oil, and cattle breeding. An investigation carried out by the information platforms Disclose and Repórter Brasil, in partnership with the NGOs Sherpa, Harvest, and Center Climate Crime Analysis, pointed out that this environmental catastrophe has been supported by four French banks for almost ten years: BNP Paribas, the Banque Populaire et Caisse d'Épargne group (BPCPE), Société Générale, and Crédit Agricole. The report found that these four institutions financed companies linked to the deforestation of the Amazon and Cerrado with more than 743 million euros (almost R$4.2 billion) between 2013 and 2022. In total, the report highlights more than 12,000 financial transactions, compiled by NGO Forest & Finance, between these four French banks and agribusiness giants. The document cites the Americans Bunge and Cargill, as well as the Brazilians Minerva, Marfrig, and JBS, the world's top beef producer. BNP Paribas, the main bank involved According to Disclose, the main bank involved in the transactions is BNP Paribas, France's largest, which is said to have disbursed more than 456 million euros (more than R$2.5 billion) in investments in soy, beef and palm oil in about ten years. ""Between January 2021 and September 2022 alone, BNP invested some 117 million euros in the activities of several agribusiness giants involved in the deforestation of the Amazon and Cerrado,"" says the platform's website. On its website, Repórter Brasil says that in 2021, BNP Paribas had already committed to no longer finance companies involved in the destruction of Brazilian forests by adopting new criteria. ""However, data from the Forests & Finance coalition show the opposite: this was precisely the year of BNP Paribas' highest financing to the company Marfrig, one of the three large Brazilian meatpacking plants,"" the platform says. Jean-Philippe Foegle, lawyer at Sherpa, one of the NGOs partnered by Disclose and Repórter Brasil in the investigative report, says that the financing by French banks does not have the precise objective of destroying Brazilian forests, ""but they make investments in companies that are known to practice deforestation. Foegle recalls that French law obliges institutions to be prudent in their activities abroad. ""What the duty of vigilance and anti-money laundering legislation provides for is that when you have a suspicion that the actor you finance is involved in illegal activities, you must stop financing him,"" he explains. Policy ""in transition"" Contacted by RFI, BNP Paribas assures that it has put in place a strict policy to stop supporting companies involved in the deforestation of Brazilian biomes. This project, for which the bank claims it needs more time to implement, would be in transition. However, for Sherpa's lawyer, this justification is not enough. ""French banks have been committed to these engagements for years. If we wait for companies that operate in the Amazon and Cerrado to regularize their activities, it is absolutely possible that the banks that finance them, such as BNP Paribas, will suspend their investments in them. According to Foegle, Sherpa plans to take legal action in France to force the French banks cited in the report to comply with their commitments."
2023-02-08,"French Foreign Minister to meet with Lula to ""relaunch"" the relationship, with the Amazon on the agenda",239,"French Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna will begin a two-day visit to Brazil on Wednesday with the aim of ""relaunching"" a political relationship degraded during the mandate of Jair Bolsonaro, with the Amazon on the agenda, a diplomatic source said. ""The main objective is to relaunch our relationship at the political level. These last four years were not at the height of the relations we should have,"" the consulted source told the press. Colonna will meet this Wednesday in Brasilia with Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, with Foreign Minister Mauro Vieira and with Environment Minister Marina Silva, among other meetings on the Amazon and democracy, said the same source. On Thursday, the head of French diplomacy will travel to Sao Paulo - Brazil's economic capital - to meet with the governor, Tarcísio de Freitas, with French companies present in Brazil and with the expatriate community, and to visit a center to help battered women. Paris seeks to launch a roadmap to ""update"" the strategic partnership signed in 2008 between Lula and the then French president, Jacques Chirac, to reinforce ""now central"" themes such as environmental ""challenges"", global governance, etc. Cross-border cooperation - France has with Brazil its largest land border with French Guiana - will also be on the agenda. The goal is for the Brazilian president, who began his third term in office in January, and his French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron, to seal this update during a meeting between the two later this year, although no date has yet been set, the diplomatic source said. The meeting could take place around the Amazon summit - planned for 2023 but without date - promoted by Lula and his Colombian counterpart, Gustavo Petro, and to which Macron was invited, the French Foreign Ministry said. Lula's return to power in the Latin American giant, which he had already governed between 2003 and 2010, was a balm for the relations between both economic powers, degraded during the mandate of the far-right Bolsonaro. Symbolic of that bad relationship occurred during the last visit of a French foreign minister to Brazil, Jean-Yves Le Drian, in 2019. Bolsonaro canceled a meeting with him citing other obligations. At the time of the appointment, he appeared live on social networks cutting his hair. The resumption of the Franco-Brazilian relationship focuses, above all, on issues of tension with the previous administration: management of the Amazon, protection of democracy, defense of human rights and global governance. During a telephone conversation last January 26, Macron expressed to Lula his support after ""the attacks on Brazilian democracy"" in early January, when radical Bolsonaro supporters ransacked the headquarters of the public authorities in Brasilia. Interest in the Amazon During Jair Bolsonaro's government, the Brazilian Amazon reached a deforestation record. During his last year alone in the Planalto Palace, 10,267 kilometers of vegetation cover were lost, equivalent to a country like Lebanon. This figure, in turn, shows an increase of 24.9% over the area of forest damaged the previous year, when it was 8,219 square kilometers. Thus, 2022 recorded the highest number since the National Institute of Special Studies (INPE) began measuring so-called deforestation alerts in 2015. Prior to the latest report released, the year with the highest deforestation recorded was 2019, when Bolsonaro became president of Brazil, and 9,178 square kilometers were lost. For these estimates, the agency uses satellite images disseminated by Deter, a mechanism that alerts monthly and in real time about threatened areas in the Amazon. However, its data are less precise than those of Prodes, another tool used by INPE to calculate deforestation each year. Prodes released its latest bulletin in November and reported that, between August 2021 and July 2022, the Amazon lost 11,568 kilometers of vegetation, an extension 11.3% less than that recorded in the same period of the previous year, when it was 13,038 square kilometers. This was, however, the highest in the last 14 years. The report also informed that between August and December 2022 alone, 4,793 kilometers of forest were logged there, a record for the period. In addition, in December alone, deforestation extended over 218.4 square kilometers, which represents a 150% jump compared to the same month in 2021, when it was only 87 square kilometers. Again the highest number for this month since the beginning of the previous government. These figures are not surprising since, from the very beginning, Bolsonaro stated that forest conservation was not one of his priorities. On the contrary, he decimated the offices in charge of its preservation and defended mining even in the reserves. This caused multiple criticisms from environmental groups, who hold him responsible for the current crisis in the Amazon. In view of this delicate context and in order to fulfill one of his main campaign promises, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva assured that one of the priorities of his administration will be to reduce deforestation in the Amazon to a minimum. To this he added a relentless fight against illegal logging and mining, also major causes of environmental disasters. In this sense, his Minister of the Environment, the environmentalist Marina Silva, moved forward with the creation of a secretariat dedicated exclusively to combating deforestation. On the other hand, the executive secretary of the Climate Observatory, Marcio Astrini, warned that ""the destruction alerts were record in the last months of 2022, which left the Lula government a rate that will negatively affect the numbers of 2023″. And concluded that ""Bolsonaro's government may be over, but his nefarious environmental legacy will be felt for a long time"".

2023-01-30,Germany announces fund for environmental policies in Brazil,240,"SAO PAULO (AP) - German Development Minister Svenja Schulze announced Monday that her government will make 204 million euros ($222 million) available for environmental policies in Brazil. Of this total, US$ 38 million is a donation to the Amazon Fund, Schulze told journalists in the capital, Brasilia. This is the most important international cooperation effort to preserve the Amazon rainforest and is financed mainly by Norway. In 2019, former far-right president Jair Bolsonaro, who considered the Amazon a national issue, dissolved the steering committee that selects sustainable projects to fund. In reaction, Germany and Norway froze their donations. ""With the new government and the team of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and (Environment) Minister Marina Silva, we have a great opportunity to protect the forest and offer a new perspective to the people who live there,"" Schulze said. Under Bolsonaro, deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon reached a 15-year high with the disappearance of environmental protection policies in favor of agribusiness expansion. Germany also pledged to provide $87 million in low-interest loans for farmers to restore degraded areas and $34 million for Amazonian state authorities to protect the rainforest. ""Despite all the difficulties, the increase in deforestation, land grabbing, fires, the precarious situation of indigenous peoples, we see this as an opportunity to reverse this whole situation,"" Silva said during the press conference. Lula, who took office in January, pledged to end all deforestation by 2030. His four-year term ends in December 2026. The Amazon, which covers an area twice the size of India, acts as a buffer against climate change because its trees absorb large amounts of carbon dioxide and about two-thirds of the Amazon rainforest is in Brazil. It is also the most biodiverse forest in the world and contains 20% of the planet's freshwater. ___ The Associated Press' climate and environmental coverage is supported by several private foundations.

Germany also pledged to provide $87 million in low-interest loans for farmers to restore degraded areas and $34 million for Amazon states to protect the rainforest. “Despite all the difficulties, the increase in deforestation, the land grabbing, the fires, the dire state of the Indigenous populations, we see this as an opportunity to reverse this whole situation,” Silva said during the press conference. Lula, who took office in January, pledged to end all deforestation by 2030. His four-year term ends in December 2026. The Amazon, which covers an area twice the size of India, acts as a buffer against climate change because its trees absorb large amounts of carbon dioxide, and roughly two-thirds of the Amazon rainforest lies in Brazil. It is also the most biodiverse forest in the world and holds 20% of the world’s fresh water.  ___ Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

2023-01-02,Germany to resume investments in the Amazon Fund,242,"Traveling to Brazil, the president of Germany, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, visited the state of Amazonas today (2). In Manaus, he met with governor Wilson Lima, reappointed yesterday (1), with whom he talked about the Amazon. Steinmeier came to Brazil to honor the new president of the Republic, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, in his inauguration, yesterday (1°). During the meeting with Wilson Lima, the German representative spoke about his country's intentions to resume investments in the region through the Amazon Fund. Related news: Supreme Court determines reactivation of the Amazon Fund. Norway and Germany donated R$ 3.4 billion to the Amazon Fund. The Amazon Fund aims to finance projects to reduce deforestation and control the biome. The financing mechanism had been deactivated by the last government and has been reactivated now, after determination of the Supreme Court (STF). According to the German president, the investments planned are around 35 million euros. Created in 2008, the fund receives donations from international institutions and governments to finance actions to prevent and combat deforestation in the Legal Amazon. In 2019, Germany and Norway suspended transfers to new projects after the Brazilian government suggested changes in the application of resources and abolished the fund's management collegiate. Visit to Manaus Steinmeier went to the state of Amazonas to learn about projects and actions financed with funds from the German government. Among them is the Atto Tower, in São Sebastião do Uatumã, about 240 kilometers from Manaus. This tower monitors the climatic conditions of the region and the greenhouse effect issues, coordinated by Brazilian and German researchers.

2022-11-04,Growing soy on cattle pasture can eliminate Amazon deforestation in Brazil,243,"Nov 04, 2022( Mongabay News: http://news.mongabay.com Delivered by Newstex)   Expanding soy cultivation into underutilized cattle pastureland would help prevent massive deforestation and carbon emissions compared to the current practice of clearing new forest for farmland, a new study says.Experts say that Brazil, the world's No. 1 soy producer and beef exporter, has enough pastureland lying unused that would allow soy production to increase by more than a third without any further deforestation.Researchers warn that if Brazil continues with its current method of soy cultivation, it would end up clearing 5.7 million hectares (14 million acres) of Amazon rainforest and Cerrado savanna into cropland over the next 15 years.Environmentalists have welcomed intensifying agriculture as a solution to deforestation, but have raised concerns about the potential for increased pesticide use, biodiversity loss, and the expansion of cattle ranching into forested areas. Soy cultivation and cattle ranching are two of the biggest drivers of deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon. But instead of clearing more forest area for farmland, what if soy was grown on unused pastureland?  That's what a recently published study[1] sought to model. It found that deforestation could be eliminated and carbon emissions slashed if Brazil intensified its agricultural sector this way — a win-win for both the economy and the rainforest.  The study, published in Nature Sustainability, found that intensifying crop and livestock systems would stop soybean production expanding into forested areas, allowing Brazil to produce 162 million tons of soybeans over the next 15 years, boosting soy production in the Amazon and Cerrado biomes by 35% without any further deforestation.  'We have areas with a low number of cattle per hectare. If we improve agricultural practices and work with better management practices, we will be able to increase the capacity in the same area,' study co-author Alencar Zanon, an adjunct professor of biology at the Federal University of Santa Maria, told Mongabay by phone.  The Amazon rainforest and Cerrado grasslands, the key areas for soybean production in Brazil, the world's No. 1 producer of the grain, have swaths of little-used pasturelands that are prime for intensification.  'Cattle ranching in the Amazon is done inefficiently and extensively,' Sonaira Souza da Silva, an agronomist and professor at the Federal University of Acre, who was not involved in the study, told Mongabay by email. 'The stocking rate is less than one head of cattle per hectare, but with the application of effective and already known technical practices, it could rise to 2.5 or higher.'  Illegal deforestation and cattle ranching in the Amazon forest, which sometimes occurs in protected Indigenous reserves, such as here in the state of Maranho. Image Victor Moriyama/Greenpeace.  Those technical practices include increasing soybean yields by improving degraded pastures, harvesting two crops in a calendar year, and raising cattle within smaller pastures to free up space for more soy planted area.  The study says that if these changes aren't made, it will lead to 'massive encroachment on the Amazon rainforest, biodiversity loss, and increased global warming.' Under the business-as-usual scenario, up to 5.7 million hectares (14 million acres) of Amazon and Cerrado land would be cleared for cropland over the next 15 years, leading to 1,955 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions.  'If we intensify our agriculture, we can certainly eliminate deforestation,' Zanon said. 'The only way we have to protect the Amazon rainforest and to reduce global warming is through the intensification of agriculture.'  Most cattle ranchers in Brazil have small herds that graze on vast areas of pasture — the ideal starting point for expanding intensive farming in the country, Zanon said.  'We have enough open land in Brazil that, with sustainable intensification of livestock, we can recover degraded pasture area and so reduce legal deforestation,' Luiza Bruscato, executive manager of the nonprofit Sustainable Livestock Working Group (GTPS), who was not involved in the study, told Mongabay by phone.  Implementing such intensive agricultural techniques and eliminating deforestation could 'happen in just a few years,' Marcelo Stabile, a researcher at the Amazon Environmental Research Institute (IPAM) who was not involved in the study, told Mongabay by video call. 'We can prompt these changes through policies relating to credit, land tenure and environmental licensing, so that intensification can optimize the use of existing agricultural infrastructure.'

Image Fernando Frazo/Agncia Brasil. Soy farms driving deforestation  As the world's largest soy exporter[2], accounting for 40% of global exports[1] from 2017 to 2019, Brazil is economically reliant on the commodity. But soy production has historically happened at the expense of the environment, turning vast expanses of rainforest and savanna into farmland.  'Much of the increase in agricultural output has occurred from cropland expansion rather than cropland productivity,' the researchers say in the study.  From 2007 to 2019, the total area for soybean production in Brazil expanded[1] by 1.4 million hectares (3.5 million acres) per year — or 3,836 hectares (9,479 acres) per day, three times the size of London's Heathrow airport. Pastures and croplands have replaced nearly 65 million hectares (160.6 million acres) of forest and savanna in the Brazilian Amazon since 1985, a 2020 study found[3], with soy production in particular driving massive deforestation rates during the 1990s and early 2000s.  Under Brazil's Forest Code, farmers must set aside between 20 and 80% of native vegetation on their rural properties as 'legal reserves,' allowing a limited amount of legal deforestation for agricultural expansion. However, up to 90% of deforestation[4] is suspected to be illegal, carried out by ranchers, loggers, miners and land grabbers, who seek to profit from the occupation and exploitation of public lands.  'People don't deforest these lands to produce more beef or soy,' Stabile said. 'They do it because they can steal public lands and expect to claim the land titles and resell the land at a higher price.'  Other drivers of deforestation are infrastructure works (such as hydroelectric plants), road construction, mining projects, and forest fires, a 2018 study[5] found.  'Deforestation is complex and has a lot of aspects involved,' Miguel Scarcello, general secretary of the nonprofit conservation group SOS Amazonia, told Mongabay by phone. 'However, intensifying production is a good agricultural practice that, without a doubt, will help the Amazon a lot if it's adopted. I believe it will help reduce the pressure on forest areas.'  The border region between the states of Maranho, Tocantins, Piau and Bahia, known by the portmanteau Matopiba, is known for its high production of soy and corn, which have expanded rapidly in the last few decades at the expanse of the Cerrado and Amazon landscapes. Image Marizilda Cruppe/Greenpeace. Unintended drawbacks  Despite the positive impact that intensification could have on reducing deforestation, critics say it could lead to large monocultures, which bring their own set of environmental hazards.  'One of the big issues of monocultures is the huge use of chemical fertilizers and that their natural reserves are finite,' Silva said. 'This will generate instability in the production chain and in the exploitation of natural resources.'  Earlier this year[6], Brazil's lower house of Congress cited the shortage of fertilizers, caused by the Ukraine war, to push through a bill that would allow mining for potassium, a key element in fertilizers, on Indigenous territories — even though almost all of Brazil's potassium reserves lie outside Indigenous lands.  Soy production is also associated with pesticide use, raising concerns that an increase in cultivation would have further devastating effects on the environment.  'If farmers don't use the techniques correctly and it leads to an excessive use of pesticides, that could be a problem,' Scarcello said.  The long-term impact of pesticide use on soy crops, including the effects on human health and freshwater quality, are little understood, according to a 2020 paper[7]. It found that the herbicides and insecticides used in soy cultivation can be 'very toxic to aquatic ecosystems,' including pollinator populations.  As well as being detrimental to the environment, monocultures can also cause or exacerbate social conflicts.  A soy field stretches across the landscape in Mato Grosso, a state that's home to three of Brazil's most biodiverse biomes: the Amazon rainforest, the Cerrado grasslands, and the Pantanal wetlands. Image Marcelo Camargo/Agncia Brasil.  'Monocultures have a more mechanized workforce, which generates fewer jobs in some cases, and they are owned by the same owner who has a concentration of the income,' Bruscato said. 'I think these are things that need to be looked at and studied.'  Experts say that while using existing cattle pastures could eliminate the tree loss associated with soy cultivation, it could end up causing an increase in deforestation for more pasture. 'We need to monitor if the replacement of pasture with soy isn't simply pushing pastures into other areas and causing more deforestation for livestock,' Silva said.

2023-01-29,Human activity has degraded almost 40% of the Amazon in less than twenty years.,244," The Amazon rainforest is dying. Land conversion for agricultural and livestock land and climate change are 'killing' one of the 'lungs' of the planet, a critical point for global biodiversity.  A scientific study has revealed that human activity has degraded more than a third of the forests in the Amazon basin, an area five times the size of Spain. The authors have launched a dramatic call to prevent and contain illegal logging and the use of fire.  The research, carried out by an international team of 35 scientists and researchers from Brazil and the UK, has revealed that anthropogenic changes are occurring ""much faster"" than previously thought, and much more so than natural environmental changes in the past.  ""Degradation is having a major impact on biodiversity and carbon storage,"" warn the authors of the study, published in the journal 'Science'.  The report describes changes in the Amazon region between 2001 and 2018, and shows that much of the Amazon rainforest has been affected during that time period by some form of human disturbance, leading to ""carbon emissions equivalent to or greater than those from deforestation.""  The results of the study are troubling:""Approximately 2.5 million square kilometers of Amazon rainforest are currently degraded by fire, edge effects, timber extraction or extreme drought, representing 38% of all forests in the region,"" the authors warn.  Biodiversity loss  The researchers distinguish between deforestation and degradation. They define the former as ""the removal of the forest completely to establish a new land use, for example agriculture"", and the latter as the result of ""transient or long-term changes in forest conditions caused by humans"". Thus, although heavily degraded forests may lose almost all trees, the land use itself does not change, they explain.  Photo taken in 2019, four years after a fire affected this forest fragment, which was also previously affected by multiple anthropogenic disturbances, including selective logging, edge effects, and fires. Marizilda Cruppe / Rede Amazônia Sustentável  ""Most analyses of land-use change in the Amazon rainforest have focused on the causes and effects of deforestation. However, anthropogenic disturbances also cause degradation of the Amazon rainforest and threaten its future,"" they say.  Among these disturbances, the four most important are: edge effects (due to deforestation and consequent habitat fragmentation), timber extraction (in many cases illegal), fires (the vast majority caused by arson) and extreme droughts (intensified by human-induced climate change).  ""Despite uncertainty about the full effect of these disturbances, it is clear that their cumulative effect may be as important as deforestation through carbon emissions and biodiversity loss,"" highlights Jos Barlow, professor of conservation science at Lancaster University (UK) and co-author of the paper.  ""While some disturbances, such as edge effects, can be addressed by slowing deforestation, others, such as limiting the increase in extreme droughts, require additional measures, including global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,"" the researchers note.  Carbon emissions  ""Curbing degradation will also require engaging with the diverse set of actors that drive it,"" knowing in depth all the perturbations and ""providing a solid platform on which to build appropriate policies and programs to curb it,"" they add.  ""Carbon emissions from this degradation total up to 0.2 petagrams (200 million tons) per year, which is equivalent, if not greater, to the emissions from deforestation in the Amazon,"" they stress.  ""Degradation of the Amazon rainforest can reduce evapotranspiration during the dry season by up to 34% and cause as great a loss of biodiversity as deforestation in human-modified landscapes, generating unequal socioeconomic burdens, mainly for forest dwellers,"" they detail.  Figure summarizes the causes of degradation in the Amazon. Alex Argozino / Studio Argozino / Science Magazine  What is most worrying, according to the scientists, is that projections indicate that degradation will continue to be ""a dominant source of carbon emissions,"". In a projection made for 2050, the study reveals that the four factors already noted for degradation will continue to be the main sources of carbon emissions to the atmosphere, regardless of the growth or suppression of forest deforestation.  ""Even in an optimistic scenario, if there were no deforestation, the effects of climate change would cause forest degradation to continue, which would generate more carbon emissions,"" warns David Lapola, leader of the study.  ""Preventing the advance of deforestation remains vital, but efforts to slow deforestation must be integrated with policies to address degradation, and complemented by innovative measures to address the disturbances that degrade the Amazon rainforest,"" the scientists say.  They suggest delving into the concept of""smart forests"" which, like the idea of ""smart cities,"" would use different types of technologies and sensors to collect useful data to improve the quality of the environment. ""There is a need to invest in innovative strategies,"" Lapona concludes.  Reference study: https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abp8622  ......

2023-01-18,IDB to support Amazon protection with US$73.5 million,245,"The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) will allocate 73.5 million dollars to promote the energy transition and the implementation of the Plan to Contain Deforestation in the Amazon, which is the first support of the multilateral bank to the government of President Gustavo Petro, as reported on Wednesday morning by the Casa de Nariño.  The announcement of the international financial organization was made during the bilateral meeting of the Colombian President with the president of the IDB, Ilan Goldfajn, which took place this Wednesday in the framework of the World Economic Forum being held in Davos (Switzerland).According to official information, it was established that 70 million dollars from the IDB will be directed to the strengthening of the energy transition policy, one of the pillars of the Government of Change. The remaining 3.5 million dollars, donated by the multilateral bank, will be directed to the Amazon basin for the design and structuring of financial mechanisms and a regulatory framework to implement Payment for Environmental Services (PES) and mechanisms to reduce Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+).These are direct transfers for environmental conservation services that help contain and halt deforestation, in coordination with local communities and under the leadership of the Ministry of Environment.Additionally, the IDB president indicated that the IDB could support the financing of the logistics of the Amazon Summit and its technical tables.It should be noted that the IDB had approved a technical cooperation of US$450.The Presidency of the Republic also informed that the World Health Organization (WHO) will send a commission of experts to Colombia in the next few days to accompany the discussion of the health reform, announced this Wednesday the director of the international organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, in a meeting with President Gustavo Petro.At the meeting, held within the framework of the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos (Switzerland), President Petro asked to discuss the issue of patents and technology transfer in health matters.The WHO director, who was accompanied by the WHO director of Health and Multilateral Partnerships, Gaudenz Silberschmidt, invited the Colombian head of state to participate in the 76th World Health Assembly in Davos (Switzerland ) .

2023-01-18,"In 2022, the Amazon had the highest deforestation in 15 years",246,"Deforestation in the Amazon hit a new record in 2022, year in which the vegetation cover of the forest lost 10,573 km², equivalent to almost 3 thousand soccer fields, according to a report released today by the Institute of Man and Environment of the Amazon (Imazon). According to the satellite monitoring, 2022, which reached its highest level since 2008, when Imazon started monitoring the Amazon Region. In the last four years, forest loss in the Amazon was 35,193 km², according to Imazon. The area exceeds that of states like Sergipe (21 thousand km²) and Alagoas (27 thousand km²). The period coincides with the mandate of former president Jair Bolsonaro, who used to discredit data on deforestation. The Minister of the Environment, Marina Silva, has been making statements about forest preservation. In one of the first measures, the Amazon Fund was unlocked, which counts on donations from Germany and Norway to be applied in environmental protection actions. ""We hope that this was the last deforestation record reported by our satellite monitoring system, since the new government has promised to give priority to protecting the Amazon"" said researcher Bianca Santos, from Imazon, in the material released today. The institute highlighted the jump in deforestation recorded in December, a month in which 287 km² of forest were cut down, an increase of 150% compared to the same month in 2021 (140 km²) and the worst last month of the year of any historical series. ""In the last month of the year there was an unbridled race to deforest while the gate was open for the cattle, for land speculation, for illegal mining and deforestation in indigenous lands and conservation units. This shows the size of the challenge of the new government"", said Carlos Souza Jr, Amazon monitoring coordinator at the institute, in the publicity material. About 80% of the area deforested in 2022 is in lands under the responsibility of the federal government (8,443 km²). Another 11% of destroyed territory is under the jurisdiction of state governments (1,130 km²). Also according to the report, the state that deforested the most in 2022 was Pará (3089 km²), followed by Amazonas (2270 km²) and Mato Grosso (1228 km²). Last Thursday, the directors of the National Council of Extrativist Populations (CNS), the Chico Mendes Memorial (MCM) and the Chico Mendes Committee presented their demands and recommendations in favor of forest peoples to Marina, in Brasília. One of the issues discussed was the dismantling of Extractive Reserves (RESEXs) and Conservation Units (UCs) in the Amazon, such as the RESEXs Chico Mendes and Verde Para Sempre, located in Acre and Pará, respectively. According to CNS president Júlio Barbosa, the meeting with Marina was a great opportunity to align alliances that bring dignity to the forest peoples. ""If the government looks at these two reserves and tries to solve their problems definitively, we are sure that this will have a very positive effect on the other reserves in the Amazon"", he explains. Another point exposed was the evasion of leaders to the big cities, hindering the dialogue of unification against predatory activities in the region. Despite the problems, Marina Silva's experience and commitment to social agendas increase hopes for a renewal. ""She was very receptive to our movement and we believe that we will begin to build a great alliance between the rubber tapper and extractivist movements in the Amazon and the Ministry of the Environment, for a fairer Amazon"", declares Júlio.

2022-11-15,Lula arrived at the climate change summit and there is expectation for an announcement of zero deforestation in the Amazon,247,"In the midst of new coup demonstrations in front of barracks in several Brazilian cities, President-elect Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva arrived on Tuesday in Egypt to participate in the COP27 conference on climate change. The president-elect is scheduled to meet with U.S. special envoy John Kerry and to make announcements about his policy on the Amazon. His official agenda will take place on Wednesday and Thursday in the Egyptian city of Sharm el Sheik. According to the Brazilian newspapers O Globo and Folha de Sao Paulo, the president-elect will announce new goals for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and proclaim his commitment to ""zero deforestation"" in the Amazon. According to the São Paulo newspaper, Lula also plans to propose that his country host COP30, to be held in 2025. Lula's first trip abroad after his election victory Lula arrived in Sharm el Sheik accompanied by the former mayor of Sao Paulo, Fernando Haddad, the main candidate to take over as foreign minister in his future government, which will begin on January 1. His wife Rosángela Janja Silva also traveled. The president-elect will be advised at the summit by former environment ministers Marina Silva and Izabella Teixeira and by Senator Randolfe Rodrigues. Lula lleva a la cumbre del cambio climático su compromiso de deforestación cero en el Amazonas (Foto: EFE) Rodrigues is also a member of the transition team, which on Monday denounced the failure of President Jair Bolsonaro's administration to provide the latest data on deforestation in the Amazon. Lula is the personality most expected this week at the summit by an international community that is betting on a radical change in Brazilian environmental policy. Environmentalists denounced a strong advance in the deforestation of the Amazon during the administration of outgoing president Jair Bolsonaro. New coup expressions in Brazil: thousands of people demand military intervention in front of barracks While Lula arrived in Egypt to participate in the climate summit, thousands of Brazilians gathered this Tuesday in front of Army commands in Rio de Janeiro, Brasilia and other cities, asking for a military intervention against Lula da Silva's electoral victory on October 30. On a national holiday, thousands of Brazilians dressed in the green and yellow colors of the national flag gathered in the morning in front of the Eastern Military Command, the main Army headquarters in this region, in the center of the city of Rio de Janeiro. Miles de personas pidieron a las Fuerzas Armadas una intervención militar contra Lula (Foto: AP) ""We don't want Lula to take command on January 1st, we don't want a communist country, we want a better Brazil,"" banker Lais Nunes, 30, told AFP during the demonstration. Many carried the Brazilian flag and sang the national anthem every time it was played from a truck with loudspeakers. ""There are several reports that there was fraud in the elections (...) we cannot accept that"", said policeman Leandro de Oliveira, 38, who attributes the fraud to an alleged conspiracy by the Superior Electoral Court (TSE) to favor the former president. These arguments have already been denied by authorities and international observers. InBrasilia thousands of people also gathered in front of the Army Headquarters, carrying banners with slogans such as ""S.O.S. Armed Forces"" or ""audit at the polls"". Security was reinforced in the central region of Brasília this Tuesday after the call for protests through social networks. Police ""preventively"" restricted the access of vehicles and pedestrians to the Three Powers Square, where the buildings of the Presidency, the Congress and the Supreme Court are located, according to the Federal District Security Secretariat."
2023-02-10,Lula da Silva carries out an intense agenda in Washington before meeting with Joe Biden,248,"The President of Brazil, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, arrived in Washington as part of his first visit to the country after returning to the Presidency of the South American giant. He is accompanied by Ministers Mauro Vieira, of Foreign Affairs; Fernando Haddad, of Finance; Marina Silva, of Environment; Anielle Franco, of Racial Equality; Ambassador Celso Amorim; the Secretary of the Ministry of Economic Development and Trade, Marcio Elias Rosa; and Senator Jaques Wagner. Lula's visit to the United States, just at the beginning of his term in office and at the invitation of President Biden, marks the resumption of relations between the two countries, which will celebrate 200 years of diplomacy in 2024, according to a press release published by the official website of the Brazilian Presidency. ""Two of the world's largest democracies, Brazil and the United States, face similar challenges related to political radicalization and hate speech in the virtual space. Also at the center of the agenda is the reactivation of Brazil's commitment to environmental conservation and the search for a greater commitment from developed countries to fulfill their climate finance commitments,"" he says. Before the expected meeting with Joe Biden this Friday, Lula will have a full agenda, since he will meet with Senator Bernie Sanders, with congressmen and congresswomen of the Democratic Party, and also with representatives of the largest trade union federation in the United States, AFL-CIO. He will return to Brazil on Saturday at noon. The Brazilian Executive indicated that, in the economic sphere, ""efforts are being made to promote investments, particularly in energy transition and clean energy generation, and greater integration of production chains. The United States is Brazil's second largest trading partner and the main destination for our exports of industrialized products,"" he said. One of the unknowns is whether Biden will use the visit with Lula to announce what would be the first U.S. contribution to the Amazon Fund, which was created in 2009 to help combat deforestation in the Amazon and was financed mainly with contributions from Norway and Germany. Norway and Germany froze their contributions to that fund with the advance of Amazon deforestation under the government of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro (2019-2023); but have expressed their desire to resume them already with Lula in power. Beyond the Amazon, the other major theme of the meeting will be the defense of democracy, especially after Bolsonaro's supporters stormed the headquarters of the three branches of government in Brasilia on January 8. According to a high-ranking official consulted by EFE news agency, the two leaders will discuss democracy in their own countries, but will also talk more broadly about initiatives to strengthen it regionally and around the world, including the so-called ""Democracy Summit"" promoted by Biden and to be held in March of this year. Lula will hold a meeting with Biden at the White House with the war in Ukraine as a focus of tension.

2022-12-05,Lula faces stiff challenge to fulfil vow to reverse Amazon deforestation in Brazil,249,"Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva’s narrow victory over President Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil ’s October elections was hailed as the potential salvation of the Amazon, after four years of unbridled destruction which have brought the rainforest close to a tipping point, threatening the very survival of the Indigenous populations whose lives depend upon it. Lula has vowed to reverse the environmental destruction wreaked under his far-right predecessor and work towards zero deforestation by tackling crime in the Amazon and guaranteeing the protection of Indigenous rights. But the president-elect, who takes office on 1 January 2023, faces an uphill battle to meet these big promises he has made to the Brazilian people and the international community. “Lula is going to face the challenge of how to be ambitious on climate issues, and at the same time be effective, meet the pledges that are being made,” said Natalie Unterstell, president of climate policy thinktank Instituto Talanoa. “Brazil’s climate leadership will have to be rebuilt on the basis of results, not just of talk.” The incoming government’s priorities will be to rebuild and strengthen the state’s environmental institutions, which have been gutted under Bolsonaro, and acknowledge the vital conservation role played by Indigenous Brazilians, whose rights have come under unprecedented assault. There is talk of creating a ministry of Indigenous peoples. Lula’s government will also have to contend with increasingly violent and diversified crime in the Amazon, with loggers, land grabbers, illegal miners and other criminals emboldened by Bolsonaro’s laissez-faire attitude. “Deforestation is just the tip of the iceberg, there are many illicit economies and many actors with a level of organisation, sophistication and violence that is much higher than when Lula’s previous administrations saw big successes in reducing deforestation,” said Ilona Szabó of the Instituto Igarapé, a thinktank focused on public and climate security. The environmental working group in Lula’s transition team – which includes Marina Silva, the environment minister who oversaw a sharp drop in deforestation during Lula’s first term and is tipped to perhaps reprise her old role – has indicated that environmental law enforcement will be a priority and has spoken of tackling deforestation in Brazil’s other biomes. “Apathy, impunity are over,” Aloizio Mercadante, a coordinator on the transition team, said in a recent press conference. Amazon deforestation totalled 11,568 sq km in the year from August 2021 through to July 2022, the national space agency INPE’s recent annual deforestation report showed – an 11% decrease on the previous year but still the second highest figure since 2008. Across the four years spanning Bolsonaro’s time in office, an area more than twice the size of Wales (over 45,000 sq km) was cleared in the Amazon. Deforestation and land use change are the biggest contributors to Brazil’s greenhouse gas emissions, which grew 12.2% overall last year according to the Climate Observatory watchdog. The destruction of the country’s biomes accounted for 1.19bn tonnes of the total 2.16bn tonnes of CO 2 equivalent the South American giant emitted in 2021. Bringing down deforestation levels is therefore of primordial importance if Brazil is to reduce its overall emissions and meet internationally agreed targets. All this will require funds – another major challenge for the incoming government as Brazil’s mandatory expenses and fiscal rules give it very little room to increase environmental budgets. The transition team is currently in discussions with congress to exclude certain expenses – including foreign donations destined to the environmental agenda – from a constitutionally mandated spending cap. Although the task ahead is immense, Lula will benefit from a positive scenario internationally, said Márcio Astrini, the chief executive of the Climate Observatory. The president-elect was given a hero’s welcome at the Cop27 climate summit in Sharm el-Sheikh in November, where he announced that “Brazil is back” in the fight against the climate crisis. Germany and Norway signalled that they would restart donations to the Amazon Fund, an important tool in combatting deforestation that has been paralysed under the Bolsonaro government, after the supreme court ordered the fund’s reactivation shortly after the election. Lula’s victory is also understood to have spurred talks with Indonesia and the Democratic Republic of Congo – the two other big tropical rainforest nations – over coordinating conservation efforts. Both Unterstell and Szabó said that continued international support will depend on the incoming Lula government delivering results promptly and being transparent about its policies and the obstacles it meets along the way. “Lula is not going to work miracles in the Amazon,” Astrini conceded, adding that there was unlikely to be a significant decrease in deforestation within Lula’s first year – partly because the next annual dataset will include the last five months of Bolsonaro’s government, during which forest clearing looks set to hit new records. But, Astrini said, after Bolsonaro’s “environmental hell”, Lula represents the “concrete hope” that the Amazon can be protected and that Brazil will return to the international fight against the climate crisis."
2022-11-17,Lula pledges at Cop27 to halt Amazon deforestation,250,"“Brazil is back” and will do whatever it takes to achieve zero deforestation in the Amazon rainforest, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has told the Cop27 climate conference in Egypt. The Brazilian president-elect told a cheering audience that tackling climate change would be one of his government’s highest priorities, adding that the world would have no climate security without the Amazon being protected. Deforestation rose to a 15-year high under his defeated election rival, President Bolsonaro. In his first big speech on the international stage since his victory, Lula said tackling global warming required countries to act together because “alone we are vulnerable to the climate tragedy”. Brazil would like to host the 2025 UN climate conference somewhere within the Amazon, he said. The biggest city in the rainforest is Manaus, a former rubber boom town with an opera house. Lula told delegates at Cop27 in Sharm el-Sheikh that his country was once again open to financial contributions to a fund to protect the rainforest. Donors including Germany and Norway stopped sending contributions to the Amazon Fund after it was frozen under Bolsonaro’s presidency, but Lula said both countries had indicated they would resume payments. He said payments worth about $500 million, frozen since 2019, would be unlocked. “We are open to international co-operation,” he said, but added Brazil would not give up any sovereignty over the rainforest. Under his leadership, nature would be a “strategic ally”, not an enemy to be “knocked down by tractors and chainsaws”, he said. Lula’s arrival at Cop27 gave a boost to the atmosphere at the UN climate talks, where negotiations appear to have stalled on key issues including deeper emissions cuts and the principle of rich countries  eventually compensating  poorer ones for extreme weather impacts such as  Pakistan’s recent floods . Lungs of the Earth breathe sigh of relief at Lula’s election victory Lula, who is of the left, was greeted with cheers of “olé, olé, olé” before he used his speech to say that the world’s richest 1 per cent were responsible for a disproportionate amount of carbon emissions. He urged wealthy countries to make good on their promise of delivering $100 billion a year of climate finance by 2020, after the latest figures showed only $83 billion a year was being sent to poorer countries. Lula also said that the global world order was no longer working when it came to cutting emissions. “The world needs new global governance on the climate issue,” he said."
2022-11-16,Lula tells COP27 'Brazil is back' as he vows to end deforestation in the Amazon,251,"Brazilian President-elect Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva received a warm welcome at COP27 today.  Hundreds of people gathered to see him arrive at a side event early on Wednesday with crowds chanting his name.  Later in the day, he addressed a packed room at the UN climate conference.  Lula said that ""Brazil is once again ready to join efforts to build a healthier planet,"" referencing the recent election as ""one of the most decisive in history"".  ""The survival of the Amazon also depended on the election. Civilisation and values are back. The respect and human rights are back,"" he added.  Lula criticised world leaders for ignoring warnings about climate change and spending ""trillions of dollars"" on war ""that only result in destruction and death.""  Lula's pledge to end deforestation in the Amazon rainforest After his election victory, Lula pledged to reduce deforestation in the Amazon to zero. He once again brought up this pledge at COP27. ""There is no climate security for the world without a protected Amazon,"" he said adding that Brazil will ""do whatever it takes to have zero deforestation and degradation of our biomes.""  He announced that the fight against climate change will have the highest priority in his government - particularly the fight against deforestation.  Lula claimed that environmental crime had grown in a ""scary way"" under the previous government and said he would strengthen bodies to punish illegal activities including gold mining, logging and farming.  The President-elect also announced that Brazil would set up a ministry for Indigenous people so that those affected most by these issues would ""have a voice of their own.""  What else did Lula say at COP27? Lula made two proposals during his speech at COP27. The first was that Amazon countries come together to look at the development of the region in an integrated way.  He is seeking a world alliance for food security and the reduction of inequality. First on the list are countries like Indonesia and the Democratic Republic of Congo which, together with Brazil, have more than half of the world's primary tropical forests.  The other was for COP30 in 2025 to be hosted in Brazil - particularly the Amazon region. He hopes that this would help people to really understand the importance of this part of the world.  When Brazil chairs the G20 meeting in 2024, climate will be top of the agenda. Promises of $100 billion in climate finance also came under scrutiny with Lula saying wealthy nations must deliver on their pledges from COP15 in Copenhagen.  Touching on another hot topic at this year's UN climate conference, he called for progress on a fund for loss and damage saying that ""we cannot postpone this debate...it is time to act."""
NA,NA,252,"End of Document SHARM EL-SHEIJ, Egypt (AP) - Six weeks before his swearing-in, Brazilian President-elect Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva began a series of public appearances and meetings Wednesday at the U.N. climate summit in Egypt. Upon Lula's arrival at a pavilion, hundreds of people awaited him, many of whom cheered him and chanted slogans in Portuguese. The appearance of Lula, who last year staged an extraordinary return to the political limelight after a stint in jail for corruption, was probably one of the events that injected the most energy into the COP27 conference. During Lula's first presidency, from 2003 to 2010, deforestation of the Brazilian rainforest was greatly reduced, and he has promised to do so again. After meeting with several Brazilian governors, including those from rainforest states such as Amazonia and Para, Lula addressed a brief speech to the crowd. ""You know that we are going to undertake a great fight against deforestation,"" he said amid applause. Lula criticized President Jair Bolsonaro, who pushed for economic development in the Amazon, several times, both in his pro-business rhetoric and in the way he managed the forests. Lula defeated Bolsonaro in the October elections and will take office on January 1. ""Brazil cannot remain isolated as in the last four years, (Brazilian officials) did not travel to other countries and no other country traveled to Brazil,"" Lula said. On Tuesday night, Lula and U.S. envoy John Kerry met to discuss measures against climate change and deforestation, according to a statement from a State Department spokesman to The Associated Press. Lula is scheduled to meet with ministers from several countries. Under Bolsonaro, who was elected in 2018, environmental regulatory agencies in the Amazon were weakened. Bolsonaro, a former army captain, appointed administrators from the agribusiness sector, which opposes the creation of indigenous territories and other protected areas and pushes for the legalization of land theft. The deforested area of the Brazilian Amazon reached its highest extent in 15 years between August 2020 and July 2021, according to official figures. Satellite monitoring indicates that the trend is even greater this year. Lula did not refer to newspaper reports that Brazil is facing a possible alliance with Congo and Indonesia, where the world's largest tropical forests are located. Under the slogan ""OPEC of the Forests"" in reference to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and the way it regulates production, the idea would be for the three countries to coordinate their negotiating positions and practices on forest management and biodiversity protection. The proposal was presented last year during the climate summit in Glasgow, Scotland, according to reports. Despite Lula's promises, his government faces a daunting task. Many people, especially environmentalists and officials, celebrate promises to protect the Amazon at a climate conference like this one, but the pressures on the government to push for economic development are enormous. These come both from agriculture and mining and from many Amazonians who feel it is up to them to decide how it is used. It is also a reality that Lula has a mixed record on environmental issues. Deforestation fell dramatically during his first term in office when Marina Silva was the environment minister. But in the second, Lula began to seek the support of the agribusiness sector, and Marina Silva resigned in 2008. She is at COP27 and is being mentioned to take up the post again. Simone Karipuna, an Amazon activist present at COP27 and who attended Lua's speech, expressed hope that difficulties will be overcome because indigenous communities can work with the incoming government. ""We had no dialogue with the current government,"" she said. ____ The Associated Press' climate and environmental coverage is supported by several private foundations.

2022-10-19,"Mennonites lead fragmented deforestation in Peruvian Amazon, report says",253,"LIMA, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Groups belonging to the Mennonites have positioned themselves as a notable source of deforestation in the Peruvian Amazon, having cleared an area close to the size of Manhattan since 2017, according to a new study. Estimates from the Monitoring the Andean Amazon Project (MAAP) suggest that deforestation near Mennonite settlements has reached 659 hectares (1,628 acres) so far this year, while 98,400 hectares across the Peruvian Amazon have been affected. Although small-scale agriculture and illegal gold mining continue to account for more than 99% of deforestation in the Peruvian Amazon so far this year, MAAP director Matt Finer told Reuters that this deforestation near Mennonite camps deserved scrutiny. ""Most of the deforestation in the Peruvian Amazon is small-scale,"" Finer said. ""But in terms of having a major entity that is responsible for this amount of deforestation, that's pretty rare."" Since 2017, MAAP estimates that deforestation linked to Mennonites has reached 4,800 hectares (11,861 acres), which corresponds to four-fifths the size of Manhattan Island in New York. The Mennonites are an isolated Christian group that has spread around the world. They say they lead a peaceful life and that the expansion of their agriculture is God's will and a way to provide their families with a simple life. They could not be reached for comment on the above report on deforestation. Peru has the world's second largest section of the Amazon, the world's largest rainforest whose preservation is considered critical to mitigating climate change. Most of the Peruvian rainforest is sparsely populated and inaccessible, which has contributed to its conservation so far. Deforestation in the Peruvian Amazon has remained relatively stable in recent years, with a significant peak in 2020 during the first year of the pandemic. ""It's an entity that can continue to expand ... I think that's what makes this concerning, and not just the current deforestation,"" Finer said, ""but the potential for continued escalation of deforestation."" Mennonite settlements have drawn the attention of Peruvian authorities for their possible involvement in illegal deforestation, according to Mongabay, an environmental news organization. The Mennonites have also aroused suspicions in Mexico linked to deforestation, detailed in a recent Reuters report (Report by Marcelo Rochabrun Edited in Spanish by Aida Peláez-Fernández)."
2022-12-01,NGOs reject mediation with French group Casino for deforestation in the Amazon,254,"Eleven international, Brazilian and Colombian NGOs that accuse the French supermarket chain Casino of indirectly participating in deforestation in the Amazon refused, on Thursday (1), a judicial mediation and expect the case to be decided in the courts. ""The eleven organizations that filed a lawsuit against Casino rejected the mediation proposed"" in June by a French judge, the coalition formed by environmental groups and indigenous federations said in a statement. ""This matter must imperatively be the subject of public debate and a judicial ruling,"" it added. ""The case cannot be resolved through a solution negotiated behind closed doors and, moreover, confidential,"" the document stressed. Among the organizations are Sherpa, Mighty Eearth, Envol vert, the Coordination of Indigenous Organizations of the Brazilian Amazon (Coiab) and the National Organization of Indigenous Peoples of the Colombian Amazon (Opiac). All accuse Casino of failing to comply with its mission to monitor and respect human and environmental rights throughout its supply chain. Casino said it ""takes note"" of the complainants' refusal to enter into a negotiation to which it had declared itself ""favorable"" and reiterated, in a comment to AFP, ""the conformity of its surveillance plan with respect to French legislation."" The denunciation is based on a report published in June by the French-Colombian NGO Envol vert. This document links four farms involved in illegal deforestation in the Amazon and Cerrado in Brazil to 52 products sold in the group's ""stores and butcher stores."" ""These farms alone represent 4,500 hectares of illegally cleared forests to make room for cattle ranching. The same occurred with protected indigenous lands,"" the report highlights. Casino has in total more than 11,000 supermarkets. In Brazil, its subsidiary is the Pão de Açúcar group (GPA) and in Colombia, the Exito network. Since March 2017, French law has required companies based in France and employing more than 5,000 people or more than 10,000 worldwide to adopt effective measures to prevent human rights violations and damage to the environment. When the complaint was filed in June, the French multinational assured that its subsidiaries are among ""the most advanced companies in the sector in the fight against deforestation."""
2022-12-21,Ombudsman's Office requests Congress to file bill that would encourage deforestation in the Amazon,255,"The Ombudsman's Office expressed its rejection of the opinion approved by the Agrarian Commission of the Congress of the Republic that insists on the approval of three bills, as it indicates that it would promote deforestation in the Amazon. Through a press release, the organization detailed that these are bills N° 649/2021-CR, N° 894/2021-CR and N° 2315/2021-CR, which aim to modify the Forestry and Wildlife Law. He said that 94% of the country's forests are located in the Amazon and are ""a source of identity and life"" for around 370,000 indigenous inhabitants that make up more than 2,700 communities. They also explained that more than 80% of deforestation in the country is generated by agricultural activities. In view of this, they request a sanction for those informal holders of these deforested lands and to provide ""adequate land to promote these activities"". ""It is of the utmost importance that all state powers, including Congress, take measures to guarantee their conservation"", the organization indicated. In relation to the insistence ruling and the autograph, the Ombudsman's Office specifies that they would aggravate the problem and encourage informal possession of Amazonian forests and would violate the rights of indigenous peoples. It added that this measure would exonerate from administrative, criminal and civil responsibilities in forestry and agrarian matters those who have proof of possession and property titles on deforested lands. In another point, they emphasized that the Ministry of Agrarian Development and Irrigation (Midagri) will be the public entity that ""will approve the forest zoning"", which allows the allocation of forest land uses. It should be noted that the Ministry of Environment is the governing entity in charge of environmental material and environmental land use planning. ""An eventual promulgation of the insistence opinion or of the observed autograph will contravene the constitutional mandates of the State to promote the sustainable use of natural resources and biological diversity. In addition, it will violate a set of individual and collective rights,"" the communiqué concludes."
2022-11-11,Record deforestation in the Amazon in October,256,"The deforested area in the Amazon in October of this year was 903.86 km². The number is the highest ever recorded by Deter, a program of Inpe (National Institute for Space Research), which began in 2015. Last Friday (4), the partial number, updated through October 28, was 813.2 km², but the expectation was that the deforested area could still increase. The record deforestation for October becomes public amid Brazil's participation in COP27, the UN (United Nations) conference on climate change. On Monday (7), the country stayed out of the Leaders' Partnership for Forests and Climate. The initiative includes 26 countries, some of them Amazon countries, such as Colombia and Ecuador, and the European Union. Itamaraty justified the absence by stating, in a note, that there are forums with a better format to ""address the needs of developing countries"". Brazil leads the way in the cutting down of forests. The release of the Prodes deforestation rate, the INPE program that measures the annual deforestation in the biome, is also expected soon. Last year, the Prodes data was already available during the COP26, but was only released by the Bolsonaro government after the event. Last year's October rate, also a record, was published during Brazil's participation in the COP in Glasgow, but the Minister of the Environment, Joaquim Leite, said at the time that he was unaware of the data. The Deter is not intended to measure deforestation, but to assist public policies to combat deforestation. However, from its data it is possible to observe destruction tendencies. However, the high rates registered by Deter may indicate that Prodes will also publish high data. All the highest monthly deforestation figures recorded by Deter up to October this year occurred under Bolsonaro's administration. The recent historical data starts in 2015, when there was an upgrade in the Deter program's sensors that makes it impossible to make a proper comparison with previous years, where there was lower accuracy."
2022-10-07,Record deforestation in the Amazon in September,257,"The Amazon had its worst September of deforestation in the recent history of Inpe (National Institute for Space Research). The Deter program recorded 1,454 km² of deforestation in the biome. The value narrowly exceeds the 1,453 km² recorded in September 2019, which was, until now, the worst September ever recorded by Inpe. The recent historical series of Deter starts in 2015. Before that, there was already Deter monitoring, but, due to the improvement in deforestation detection sensors, comparisons with previous periods are not valid. The deforestation recorded in September is equivalent to more than 900 Ibirapuera parks in São Paulo. Ramal em meio a área desmatada e queimada Ramal em meio a área desmatada e queimada Recent deforestation in the municipality of Apuí, in southern Amazonas - Lalo de Almeida - 20.Aug.2020/Folhapress  The Deter's main objective is not to measure deforestation in the biome. Its function is to detect deforestation almost in real time to help the environmental agencies' inspection operations. However, from the Deter it is possible to observe deforestation trends within a year. In the Amazon there has been a sequence of negative data for the biome. Besides the record deforestation, September was also the worst month in terms of fires in more than a decade, according to data from Inpe's Burning Program. There were more than 41 thousand fires in the forest in September this year. The figure of 40 thousand fires had not been reached since 2010, when more than 43 thousand fires were registered in the biome. The Planeta em Transe project is supported by the Open Society Foundations."
2022-10-10,Record-breaking deforestation registered in the Amazon ahead of presidential elections in Brazil,258,"Canada: Greenpeace International has issued the following press release: According to alerts from the Brazilian Space Research Institute (INPE) ’ s system DETER, 1,455 km2 is the largest area of deforestation in the Amazon ever recorded for the month of September. 2022 has seen record-breaking numbers of fires and deforestation. The data shows an increase of 48% compared to the same month last year. From January to September 8,590 km2 of the Amazon was deforested this year, equivalent to 11 times the size of New York City. Cristiane Mazzetti, spokesperson for Greenpeace Brazil, said: “In recent years, the Bolsonaro government has shown a complete disregard for a safe climate and for the Amazon rainforest, Indigenous Peoples and traditional communities. His administration has actively promoted an anti-environment, anti-Indigenous, and anti-democratic agenda that has resulted in a severe increase in carbon emissions and that paints a grave scenario in Brazil. This destructive project cannot continue. ” The current government ’ s actions have encouraged violence in the rainforest against both Indigenous Peoples and environmental defenders. According to a report published by NGO CIMI, 176 Indigenous People were murdered in 2021. Brazil also continues to be one of the most dangerous countries for environmentalists, according to a report by Global Witness. Over 17% of the entire Amazon Basin has already been deforested, and this massive destruction is pushing the forest closer to a tipping point. If 20 to 25% of the Amazon is lost, it would fail as an ecosystem, according to research done by scientists Carlos Nobre and Thomas Lovejoy. Mazzetti said: “The current government has been causing irreversible damage to the environment in Brazil and is a threat to the climate globally. In only three weeks, Brazilians will go to the polls to choose our next president, and our choice will have a tremendous impact on the country, on the forest, and on the climate. Continuing the current agenda means accelerating the collapse of the Amazon instead of using the little time we have to avoid it. Brazilians must reflect deeply on their choice in the presidential elections and vote for climate, for the forest, and for a green, safe and just future. ”"
2022-10-28,Reports Summarize Remote Sensing Research from State University (Deforestation Detection in the Amazon Using DeepLabv3+ Semantic Segmentation Model Variants),259,"2022 OCT 28 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Biotech News Daily -- Data detailed on remote sensing have been presented. According to news originating from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, ""The Amazon rainforest spreads across nine countries and covers nearly one-third of South America, being 69% inside Brazilian borders. It represents more than half of the remaining tropical forest on Earth and covers the catchment basin of the Amazon river on which 20% of the surface fresh water on the planet flows.""   Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from State University: ""Such an ecosystem produces large quantities of water vapor, helping regulate rainfall regimes in most of South America, with strong economic implications: for instance, by irrigating crops and pastures, and supplying water for the main hydroelectric plants in the continent. Being the natural habitat of one-tenth of the currently known species, the Amazon also has enormous biotechnological potential. Among the major menaces to the Amazon is the extension of agricultural and cattle farming, forest fires, illegal mining and logging, all directly associated with deforestation. Preserving the Amazon is obviously essential, and it is well-known that remote sensing provides effective tools for environmental monitoring. This work presents a deforestation detection approach based on the DeepLabv3+, a fully convolutional deep learning model devised for semantic segmentation. The proposed method extends the original DeepLabv3+ model, aiming at properly dealing with a strong class imbalanced problem and improving the delineation quality of deforestation polygons. Experiments were devised to evaluate the proposed method in terms of the sensitivity to the weighted focal loss hyperparameters-through an extensive grid search-and the amount of training data, and compared its performance to previous deep learning methods proposed for deforestation detection. Landsat OLI-8 images of a specific region in the Amazon were used in such evaluation. The results indicate that the variants of the proposed method outperformed previous works in terms of the F1-score and Precision metrics.""   According to the news reporters, the research concluded: ""Additionally, more substantial performance gains were observed in the context of smaller volumes of training data. When the evaluated methods were trained using four image tiles, the proposed method outperformed its counterparts by approximately +10% in terms of F1-score (from 63% to 73%); when the methods were trained with only one image tile, the performance difference in terms of F1-score achieved approximately +18% (from 49% to 67%).""

2022-11-05,Rio Branco and Tarauacá join preventive actions for monitoring and deforestation in the Amazon,260,"An ordinance of the Ministry of Environment, includes two Acre cities in the list of priority municipalities for actions to prevent and control deforestation in the Amazon. According to the ordinance, which was published in the Official Gazette of the Union on Thursday, 3, the Acre capital, Rio Branco, and the municipality of Tarauacá, as well as cities in Amazonas, Rondônia, Pará, and Mato Grosso, will now be part of these actions. The forest engineer, and technical coordinator of the State Secretariat of Environment and Indigenous Policies (Semapi), Quelyson Souza de Lima, talked about the preventive action to fight environmental crimes. We are working in the environmental monitoring room, which has the task of generating alerts for deforestation and forest fires in the state. And, even though this ordinance has only recently come into effect, the municipalities of Tarauacá and Rio Branco, as well as Feijó, are already our target control points. The alerts in recent years have always indicated that these cities are the most problematic in relation to these issues& he pointed out. The public servant highlighted that the focus is on inspection, however, public policies aimed at environmental education are essential. & people, we will have good practices and decrease criminal practices&. The coordinator pointed out that, of the total number of inspections in the state, 43 are integrated with other state security agencies and 10 with federal agencies, 53 in total. & to point out that in 2022, the biggest fires were in Feijó, with 21%, Tarauacá, with 14%, Sena Madureira, with 10%, and Rio Branco, with 9,3%& concluded Quelyson."
2022-10-07,September sees worst-ever deforestation rate in Amazon,261,"LONDON Ahead of Brazil's second-round presidential race later this month, Brazilian authorities have registered the worst deforestation levels in Amazon for the month of September. According to the Brazilian Space Research Institute (INPE), 1,455 square kilometers (562 square miles) of rainforest were destroyed in September 2022 &ndash; an area almost twice the size of New York City. The September 2022 record breaks the previous record for September 2019 when 1,454 km2 were destroyed. This year the Amazon has experienced a number of records broken for fires and deforestation, as from January-September 8,590 km&sup2; of it were deforested - roughly 11 times the size of New York City, according to Greenpeace. Over the past three years, an area larger than Belgium has been destroyed in the Amazon, as many environmentalists and defenders of Indigenous peoples and their territorial rights have criticized Brazil President Jair Bolsonaro's policies, insisting he has rolled back environmental protections, causing ecological destruction as illegal loggers, miners and ranchers have cleared large swathes of land. &ldquo;In recent years, the Bolsonaro government has shown complete disregard for a safe climate and for the Amazon rainforest, Indigenous Peoples and traditional communities,"" according to Cristiane Mazzetti, spokesperson for Greenpeace Brazil. In a press release, Mazzetti added Bolsonaro administration ""has actively promoted an anti-environment, anti-Indigenous and anti-democratic agenda that has resulted in a severe increase in carbon emissions and that paints a grave scenario in Brazil."" Paul Morozzo, a senior food and forests campaigner at Greenpeace UK, underscored the importance the Amazon plays in humanity's ""fight against the climate crisis&rdquo;. With more than 17% of the entire Amazon basin lost to deforestation, the destruction is pushing it towards a tipping point. According to scientists Carlos Nobre and Thomas Lovejoy, if 20 to 25% of the Amazon is lost, it would fail to act as an ecosystem. Ahead of the second round presidential vote, experts have warned that the future of the Amazon is at stake between the two radically opposed views from both presidential candidates. Far-right President Bolsonaro wishes to open up the Amazon for development while left-wing Luiz In&aacute;cio Lula da Silva who brought down deforestation during his previous tenure as Brazil's president has pledged to create an Indigenous Affairs Ministry, stop illegal gold prospecting in the Amazon, and rebuild the Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (IBAMA) environmental agency. Brazilians return to the polls for the second round on Oct. 30."
2022-12-16,The Hope For Slowing Amazon Deforestation,262," (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)  EMILY KWONG: You're listening to SHORT WAVE from NPR.  AARON SCOTT: Hey there, SHORT WAVErs. Aaron Scott here with NPR correspondent Kirk Siegler. Hello, Kirk.  KIRK SIEGLER: Hey, Aaron.  AARON SCOTT: You are fresh back from an epic reporting trip. Tell us about where you've been.  KIRK SIEGLER: I was lucky enough to travel into the Brazilian Amazon as part of a U.N. Foundation reporting fellowship, where a few of us journalists from around the world traveled into a place called Camp 41, which is a remote research camp about 80 miles north of the Amazonian capital of Manaus, where scientists have been studying the effects of deforestation on the rainforest since the '80s.  AARON SCOTT: And are we talking, like, a series of buildings in the forest here? Describe the camp to us.  KIRK SIEGLER: I would say maybe glamping adjacent.  AARON SCOTT: OK.  KIRK SIEGLER: I think we had running water, if you count running water being pipes directly from the stream. But we also had great food. We had a kitchen area and cooks. And we slept in hammocks, which was an experience in and of itself. Getting up in the middle of the night, if you needed to use the toilet, to make the trek with your headlamp on - have to be very, very aware of critters hiding in your shoes that you step into, to a few snake sightings out by the toilets. Fortunately, I didn't actually see any of them.  AARON SCOTT: And so sleeping in hammocks, glamping-adjacent kitchen, but then a bunch of scientists doing research. Tell us a little bit about their actual work. And did you get to kind of trek into the forest with them?  KIRK SIEGLER: We did. So there are these series of paths that fan out into the jungle where researchers have been looking at the effects of deforestation on habitat, what they call a fragmented forest. That is, like, forests that have been cut down - can certain bird species survive across that? Can they move to another part of the jungle that hasn't been deforested? But lately, much of the work that's going on there at Camp 41 is looking at the effects of deforestation on the global climate.  AARON SCOTT: And this is a huge topic because, I mean, for the longest time, the Amazon has absorbed more carbon dioxide than it emits. But then there was this big study that came out last year in the journal Nature that says, due to deforestation, that might have flipped, and the Amazon might actually now be emitting more carbon dioxide than it absorbs. So are we at a tipping point here when it comes to the Amazon, Kirk?  KIRK SIEGLER: Well, it's so interesting that you use that phrase because that phrase comes up all the time when you're there, and there isn't really a definitive answer as to whether or not we are. One scientist may say we are; the other not, we may still have more time. But the Amazon is one of the world's last remaining megaforests, and it's the most biodiverse place still on the planet. And it does act still, despite all the deforestation, as this big carbon sink that absorbs all the harmful CO2 gases in the atmosphere. So as we cut more of it down, that actually affects the climate elsewhere, like where you and I are talking in the Pacific Northwest, where we're seeing more wildfires. There's a real increasingly connection between the two, and that's what scientists are trying to study more about and make definitive conclusions about so they can better inform the public, of course.   (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)  AARON SCOTT: Today on the show, Kirk Siegler heads to a remote research station in the Amazon to look into the future of the forest. I'm Aaron Scott, and this is SHORT WAVE, the daily science podcast from NPR.   (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)  AARON SCOTT: So, Kirk, will you set the scene for us? The journey to Camp 41 - what was it like?  KIRK SIEGLER: Well, we had to travel about 80 miles overland out of the capital of Manaus, which is this huge city, dead center in the middle of the Amazonian jungle. But pretty quickly, do the pavement roads fade away to dirt and, in our case, slick mud. It took us seven hours to go about 80 miles...  AARON SCOTT: Wow.  KIRK SIEGLER: ...Just to get to this camp. And in a few spots, you or I sitting in these 4x4s jarring around, peering over a ledge, would think, OK, so I'm not going to get to go to Camp 41 on this trip. This is just too hazardous.  AARON SCOTT: (Laughter).  KIRK SIEGLER: But each time, our skilled Brazilian drivers, who have a lot of experience driving through hazardous conditions in the bush, would get us down some embankment that was basically itself a mudslide.   (SOUNDBITE OF CHAINSAW)  KIRK SIEGLER: And listen; you can hear the chainsaws in the background. This is not what you might think of as, you know, saws cutting down the Amazon; these are guys just clearing the road.   (SOUNDBITE OF CHAINSAW)  AARON SCOTT: Let's listen to the story.  KIRK SIEGLER: A storm brought massive wind, toppling trees, and huge rain all at once, which is unusual. So is what preceded it.  RITA MESQUITA: Even this year, we are experiencing a extreme drought. And there are whole areas of the Amazon right now that are completely dry and communities that are completely isolated.  KIRK SIEGLER: This is Rita Mesquita, a Brazilian government scientist and our guide at Camp 41. She's dedicated her life's work to protecting the rainforest.   (SOUNDBITE OF BIRDSONG)  KIRK SIEGLER: The Amazon is an important carbon sink. All this jungle soaks up those harmful CO2 gases that are making the planet warm. As more of it gets chopped down, that leads to more extreme weather elsewhere, like the fires in the American West and drought back here.  RITA MESQUITA: In this particular area where we are, we are right now in the middle of this huge dispute - if the forest is going to fall for cattle ranching or not - because amazingly, even though we have been here for 43 years straight, people still have not gotten the message.  AARON SCOTT: But scientists like Mesquita see October's presidential election in Brazil as a possible turning point.  RITA MESQUITA: I'm very hopeful that we're going to see change and that this change is going to be positive for the Amazon. But at the same time, I still think that we lack a concrete plan for the Amazon.  KIRK SIEGLER: You hear this a lot - until rich Western countries recognize that extreme poverty is not OK, the illegal logging and other development will continue no matter who's president. People are desperate for work.   (SOUNDBITE OF ENGINE TURNING OVER)  UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: (Non-English language spoken).  KIRK SIEGLER: This was the case until recently in an Indigenous village a day's boat ride from Manaus, along the Rio Negro River, where there are signs of change. A collection of brightly painted buildings and huts sits atop a steep riverbank.   (SOUNDBITE OF DOG BARKING)  KIRK SIEGLER: Roberto Brito Mendoncza says he's a fourth-generation logger but lately realized that what's going on in these forests is a direct threat to his people's survival.  ROBERTO BRITO MENDONCZA: (Non-English language spoken).  KIRK SIEGLER: ""My grandparents knew basically everything about the seasons,"" he says. ""Today, we can't predict anything."" Summers are 10 degrees hotter. It's smoky. Droughts come every couple years instead of every 30.  ROBERTO BRITO MENDONCZA: (Non-English language spoken).  KIRK SIEGLER: With the help of an NGO, Mendoncza stopped logging and is transforming this village into an ecotourism destination.  UNIDENTIFIED CHILD: (Non-English language spoken).  KIRK SIEGLER: The jungle surrounding it is now protected as a sustainable forest reserve, allowing for some small-scale logging and farming. Locals sell artisan products. Julia Freitas with the Foundation for Amazon Sustainability wants to replicate this model across the Amazon.  JULIA FREITAS: We believe that we cannot attack the deforestation problem if we don't give the people that live in the forest the possibility of living with a high quality of life.  KIRK SIEGLER: And there's hope that incoming President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva will be more friendly toward Indigenous rights. He's also expected to restore funding for environmental agencies that were gutted under Bolsonaro. A string of murders of Brazilian environmental enforcers in this jungle drew international headlines.   (CROSSTALK)  KIRK SIEGLER: At a reception in Manaus, I meet Carlos Travassos, who's taking over for one of the men recently killed.  CARLOS TRAVASSOS: (Non-English language spoken).  KIRK SIEGLER: ""I've been working to protect isolated Indigenous people for 14 years. It's always been risky,"" he says. Criminals felt emboldened under Bolsonaro, and enforcers like Travassos are still way outnumbered. But he won't give up.  CARLOS TRAVASSOS: (Non-English language spoken).  KIRK SIEGLER: ""Soon,"" he promises, ""there will be an army of forest guardians fighting to save the Amazon.""  AARON SCOTT: So, Kirk, as you share there, there's been a huge change in Brazil's government. We've gone from outgoing President Jair Bolsonaro, who was very pro-logging, to now the new incoming President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who has pledged a zero-tolerance policy on deforestation in the Amazon. Besides restoring funding for environmental agencies, has he laid out how he's going to go about that?  KIRK SIEGLER: I think it's still been light on specifics, and much of what you've heard so far is symbolic. But I don't want to discount that. You know, Lula showed up at COP27 in Egypt to a standing ovation. He's pledged to create a ministry for Indigenous peoples, which will be key because a lot of people in the Amazon, as that piece pointed out and many other stories before it, are sort of forced into having to cut down the trees due to the economic situation that they're in. But if he is going to restore funding for the environmental agencies, that will be big because they've been hobbled under Bolsonaro. But what the real question is - is it too late? You don't just reverse certain policies or the effects of them overnight; it's going to take time. And is there enough time to do that in the Amazon with deforestation? That's what nobody knows for sure.  AARON SCOTT: I'm curious. What was morale like amongst the scientists at the research station? What keeps them going?  KIRK SIEGLER: I was actually surprised. There was quite a bit of hope and also excitement and enthusiasm. We met a lot of graduate students and other younger researchers who come out to the camp who are doing their doctoral work there, most of them Brazilian. Many of them have never actually seen the Amazon until coming to Camp 41. Most of Brazil's population is urban, and most Brazilians do not get to visit the Amazon. So there was a sense of excitement about what's still being discovered in that jungle but also some optimism that things may be turning around with the change in presidential administrations.  But I think a lot of scientists on the front lines of climate change will probably tell you they have to remain optimistic because they're presented with a bunch of doom-and-gloom data all day, every day, every month of every year. But they're really on the front lines there at Camp 41 and other research facilities in Brazil like that, and I think that there is some optimism that it is not too late, that they could still - with more and more global attention coming to the poverty issue, for example, in the Brazilian Amazon, with more pressure from the international community about some of the agricultural exports out of Brazil, some of them may be tied to deforestation. I think there's going to be more international pressure, and I think some of the scientists' optimism that we spoke to is a result of seeing that there's more international awareness and attention to this increasingly global problem.   (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)  AARON SCOTT: Well, thank you so much, Kirk, for sharing this with us.  KIRK SIEGLER: For sure. Glad to be here.

2022-10-07,"Under Bolsonaro, Amazon deforestation hits new September record",263,"Oct 07, 2022( Al Jazeera English: https://www.aljazeera.com/ Delivered by Newstex)   Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon[1] has broken a record for the month of September, continuing a trend that has accelerated during the tenure of the country's far-right President Jair Bolsonaro.  About 1,455sq km (562sq miles) of rainforest were cleared in September, according to satellite data from the Brazilian space research agency INPE. That is up 48 percent from a year ago and beating the September 2019 record in a data series that began in 2015.  Average deforestation[2] in the vital ecosystem has increased by 75 percent from the previous decade since Bolsonaro took office in 2019.  The news of accelerating deforestation takes place as Brazil braces for a contentious election on October 30, where Bolsonaro will face off[3] against former left-wing president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who has promised to crack down on deforestation.  'Anyone who cares about the future of the rainforest, the lives of Indigenous peoples and the possibility of having a livable planet should vote to remove Bolsonaro,' Marcio Astrini, the executive secretary of the Climate Observatory, a coalition of environmental groups, said in a statement.  Lula won the first round last week but failed to clear the 50 percent threshold needed to avoid a run-off. Bolsonaro's surprisingly strong showing[4] in the first round, where many expected him to lose outright, has environmentalist groups feeling uneasy.  Many believe that the future of the Amazon, a vital resource in the fight against climate change, will hinge on the results of the upcoming election. About 60 percent of the Amazon is located in Brazil.  Bolsonaro, an ally of Brazil's powerful agribusiness sector, has overseen a massive depletion[5] of the rainforest as ranchers and loggers clear and set fire to wide swaths of the forest. During his first year in office in 2019, 9,178sq km (3,543sq miles) were destroyed, the worst year on record.  With three months still remaining in the year, 2022 is currently the second worst, with more than 8,590sq km (3,316sq miles) destroyed.  The Brazilian justice ministry has said that it is conducting policing operations to crack down on illegal deforestation and burning[6], the Reuters news agency reported.  But fires have surged as agribusiness interests seek to clear out space for farmland and grazing pastures. In early September, Brazil set a five-year record for the number of fires burning in the Amazon, and activists have said that under Bolsonaro enforcement has been lacklustre.  A July report by the Igarape Institute, a Brazilian think-tank, found that authorities are doing little[7] to curb deforestation in the Amazon.  The study analysed 302 environmental crime raids carried out by the federal police in the Amazon between 2016 and 2021, and found that only 2 percent targeted people illegally seizing undesignated public lands.  Indigenous people and environmental land defenders have also been targeted with violence[8] and abuse.  The president[9] has defended his policies as 'balancing environmental protection with fair and sustainable economic growth'.

2022-11-10,"United Kingdom : Colombia receives support from Germany, Norway and the UK for implementing their ambitious plan to contain deforestation in the Colombian Amazon",264,"Colombias government has launched an emergency plan to stop deforestation in the Colombian Amazon. The ambitious strategy consists of working with local communities and indigenous people in 22 deforestation hotspots, reaching agreements to strengthen economic, social and environmental conditions in these areas within 100 days of starting office, Colombias Minister of Environment Susana Muhamad already signed the first agreements with communities to reduce deforestation in Caquet, the countrys second most deforested state in 2021 international partners praise the ambitious plan, and Norway and Germany will contribute 25 million USD under the Joint Declaration of Intent the sustainable use and conservation of the Amazon, the worlds largest rainforest, is considered vital to curbing catastrophic climate change and to save unique biodiversitySharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, 7 November 2022. Colombia has the third biggest forest area in South America and is known to have one of the most biodiverse forests in the world. In face of rising deforestation in the Colombian Amazon in first quarter of 2022, Colombias government has launched an ambitious emergency plan to stop deforestation in the Amazon.The Colombian Minister of Environment and Sustainable Development, Susana Muhamad, said: Colombia is committed to the development of a solid forestry economy that contributes to the goals of zero net emissions, the guarantee and protection of the applicable rights of indigenous peoples and local communities, as well as the expansion of efforts to conserve and manage sustainably natural forests. The advances in social agreements with the communities of the areas with the greatest impact of deforestation are highlighted, with the aim of promoting sustainable forest management of natural forests, the ecological restoration of degraded areas and the sustainable use of biodiversity. The plan consists of focusing efforts in 22 deforestation hotspots in the Colombian Amazon and seeks to effectively reduce deforestation in the region where more than 50% of the deforestation of the Amazon is concentrated.Through social dialogue with communities, the Colombian government aims to reach agreements to strengthen the economic, social, and environmental conditions in these areas. Within 100 days after taking office, Minister of Environment Muhamad already signed the first agreements with communities to reduce deforestation. The agreements are part of a wider strategy to develop a National Fund to mobilize finance from national and international sources, promote a Forest Economy, improve sustainable livelihoods, and stop the expansion of the agricultural frontier. Espen Barth Eide, Minister of Climate and Environment, Norway, said:I am impressed by Colombias ambitious emergency plan to stop deforestation in the Amazon. Such strong political will to protect the Amazon is essential if we are to reach the global climate goals and protect biodiversity, as well as total peace in Colombia. Norway remains a committed partner to Colombia in this effort.Norway, Germany and the United Kingdom stressed their commitment to support the impressive ambitions of Colombias government in conserving fragile ecosystems such as the Amazon rainforest, whilst also protecting local environmental and human rights leaders and safeguarding the rights and safety of indigenous peoples, campesinos and afro-Colombian communities. Based on Colombias achievements under the Joint Declaration of Intent, signed during COP25, Norway and Germany announced a donation of USD 25 million in support of Colombias plan against deforestation. Lord Goldsmith, Minister of State for Climate and Environment at the United Kingdom Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office, said: We want to speed up and grow international support for committed and ambitious forest countries like Colombia, to spur even great action at both the jurisdictional and national level. Regulating voluntary carbon markets is essential for raising the finance we need to meet our climate, nature, and development goals throughout this decade. But those markets must be high integrity from beginning to end, and we are determined to involve rural and forest communities across the board to ensure they benefit from the natural resource they protect.Jochen Flasbarth, German State Secretary in the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development, said: We will keep supporting efforts to reduce deforestation in the future. We have to ensure that our common approach evolves and meets the challenges of the climate and biodiversity crisis. We will continue our engagement in the coming years to work towards these goals together with Colombia, Norway and the UK. It is an investment in our common future.The Joint Declaration of Intent (JDI) between Colombia, Germany, Norway and the United Kingdom is a cooperative partnership and an example of international collaboration, coordination and articulation to meet the climate goals set out in the Paris Agreement. Thus far, 194 parties have signed. The JDI utilizes results-based payments for the achievement of policy goals and emission reductions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) in Colombia."
2022-11-23,US seeks to sanction criminals behind surging deforestation in Amazon rainforest,265,"The United States is planning to slap sanctions on deforestation perpetrators in the Amazon rainforest in a bid to tackle the climate crisis.  Under outgoing president Jair Bolsonaro , deforestation hit a 15-year high as the right-wing leader unwaveringly supported record levels of mining and commercial farming in the Amazon. But people behind the deforestation are set to be threatened with Magnitsky sanctions which would freeze any US assets and block all American and US companies from dealing with sanctioned individuals and businesses.  Mr Bolsonaro however has one foot out of the door and will be replaced with climate-conscious Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva who will take office from January 2023, and has already pledged to end deforestation at Cop27 earlier this month.  But a shaky history between Lula and the US raises questions on how the left-wing leader will respond to the sanctions plan. Lula has himself said that he believes the US sought to impair him politically and played a part in him being jailed.  Nevertheless, Lula’s commitment to tackling environmental catastrophe is a positive sign for the mutual desire between the US and the president-elect to bring down deforestation levels.  “Let’s fight for zero deforestation,” Lula said in his first speech as president-elect. “Brazil is ready to resume its leading role in the fight against the climate crisis , protecting all our biomes, especially the Amazon Forest. “Brazil will fight for a living Amazon; a standing tree is worth more than thousands of logs. That is why we will resume the surveillance of the entire Amazon and any illegal activity, and at the same time we will promote sustainable development.” Popularly known as the “lungs of the world”, the Amazon forest cleans the air we breathe, stores around 76 billion tonnes of carbon in total, and releases 20 billion tonnes of water into the atmosphere each day. A US official told Reuters that the process of identifying and investigating specific targets has already begun.  The US Treasury department, which is responsible for Magnitsky sanctions, declined to comment to Reuters. Neither Bolsonaro’s office nor Brazil’s Justice Ministry responded to requests for comment. Lula’s transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment."
2022-10-07,Worst September on record for Amazon deforestation,266,"Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon broke the monthly record for September, according to official figures, triggering calls from environmentalists to vote far-right President Jair Bolsonaro out of office later this month. In the latest worrying news on the rainforest, satellite monitoring showed 1,455 square kilometres of forest cover was destroyed in the Brazilian Amazon last month, according to national space agency INPE's real-time surveillance program, DETER. An area almost the size of Leitrim, and the worst for September since the program was launched in 2015. The previous record for September was also under Mr Bolsonaro: 1,454 square kilometres in 2019. The figures came as Mr Bolsonaro battles to win re-election in an 30 October runoff against leftist ex-president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who has vowed to work to achieve net-zero deforestation. Mr Lula - who also faced criticism at times for his environmental record as president - won Sunday's first-round election with 48% of the vote, to 43% for Mr Bolsonaro. Mr Bolsonaro, an ally of the powerful agribusiness sector, has faced international criticism for presiding over a surge of destruction in Brazil's 60% share of the world's biggest rainforest, a key buffer against global warming. Since he took office in January 2019, average annual deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon has increased by 75% from the previous decade. Experts say the agribusiness industry is driving the destruction by clear-cutting and burning forest to turn it to farmland and pasture. With three months to go, 2022 is already the second-worst year on record for deforestation, at 8,590 square kilometres, according to DETER. That is second only to 2019, Mr Bolsonaro's first year in office, when 9,178 square kilometres were destroyed. The second- and third-worst years were also under Mr Bolsonaro - 2020 and 2021, respectively. ""Anyone who cares about the future of the rainforest, the lives of indigenous peoples and the possibility of having a livable planet should vote to remove Bolsonaro,"" Marcio Astrini, the executive secretary of the Climate Observatory, a coalition of environmental groups, said in a statement. Mr Bolsonaro's campaign defends his record as ""balancing environmental protection with fair and sustainable economic growth."""
2022-11-04,Zero deforestation in the Amazon is now possible - here's what needs to happen,267,"Jair Bolsonaro has been defeated in the Brazilian election against Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (""Lula"") to the rejoicing of scientists, environmentalists, and human rights activists in Brazil and beyond. What happens in South America's largest country is globally significant since, among other reasons, the country contains most of the world's largest tropical forest.  Under Lula, Brazil was able to reduce deforestation in the Amazon by 84% between 2004 to 2013 and expand indigenous rights and protection. Lula promised in his acceptance speech to work toward zero deforestation in the Amazon and to protect indigenous areas from the encroachment of mining companies and other interests. Great news. Dozens of countries and hundreds of companies and financial actors have already made bold commitments to halt deforestation. For example, Unilever aims to achieve zero conversion of native ecosystems for palm oil, paper and board, tea, soy and cocoa by the end of 2023.  But, to date, such pledges have lacked any teeth in most at-risk areas. Famously, in 2014 the New York Declaration on Forests, a coalition of committed companies, countries, civil society and indigenous groups, pledged to eliminate commodity-driven deforestation by 2020. But in 2021 the group pushed back its deadline until 2030, and many deforestation activists are sceptical that this deadline will be achieved. Little progress so far Thus far, even the most ambitious and well-implemented commitments have made little progress. Research colleagues and I published in October looked at the impact of the soy moratorium, a commitment by global traders and the Brazilian industry to stop purchasing soy produced on Amazonian forest lands cleared after 2006. Brazil's huge soy industry is the second largest driver of deforestation after beef.  We found that deforestation directly for soy in the Amazon was reduced by 55% between 2006 and 2015. For many companies, this was a very useful achievement as it helped them meet their goals of not sourcing deforestation-linked soy.  Yet it did little to protect the Amazon overall since there are other drivers of deforestation and many forest areas with the potential to produce soy were not covered by the commitments. The total avoided deforestation amounted to only 1.6% of the deforestation in the Amazon and less than 1% of all of the deforestation in Brazil during the same period.  In fact, our other research published in September has shown that half of the avoided deforestation in the Amazon was offset by deforestation ""leakage"" into the Cerrado (a huge savanna region to the south and east of the Amazon) and other forest regions in Brazil.  Colleagues and I have also published research on similar commitments made by cattle companies, which are even less effective than those for soy. However, given the magnitude of cattle-driven deforestation in the Amazon, such policies at least helped to avoid another 3% of Brazilian deforestation. These deforestation reductions are meaningful. But they still leave us far from the goal of zero deforestation, which is needed to avoid potentially catastrophic tipping points in the Amazon. Three reasons for failure (so far) There are three crucial reasons why these existing pledges have failed to do more to protect the world's tropical forests. First, existing commitments cover less than 50% of forests at risk in Brazil and likely an even smaller proportion of forests in other countries.  More companies that source deforestation-risk products, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, need to adopt zero-deforestation policies. Otherwise, farmers still have ample opportunities to sell their products grown on deforested lands and avoid committed companies. Second, many of the companies that have made bold global commitments have yet to implement these policies outside of the Amazon and parts of Indonesia and face many implementation challenges to trace and monitor their products. This leaves a major portion of the world's tropical forests still at risk from agricultural expansion.  Third, deforestation can leak across areas and actors within a region. For instance, when companies crack down on deforestation in only one ecosystem for only one commodity, deforestation for that commodity may simply increase in the area next door or shift to farms growing products not covered by the policy.  This is the case for the soy moratorium in the Amazon, which led to additional deforestation in the Cerrado. It is also the case for oil palm sustainability certification programs, which reduced deforestation in targeted areas in Kalimantan, Indonesia, but caused additional clearing of rainforest elsewhere in Borneo.  ...and four reasons to be hopeful Lula's election is pivotal to filling these gaps, at least in Brazil. For instance, the new president plans to improve deforestation governance, which will make it much easier both politically and financially for companies to comply with or implement their zero-deforestation commitments. Supportive public policy may encourage more companies to commit in more regions of Brazil.  Lula also plans to significantly reduce the power of the Brazilian agricultural lobby, even if it will continue to control a large part of congress. The lobby has fought virulently against an expansion of zero deforestation efforts. The new president can also help to implement Brazil's new payment for environmental services policy framework and channel resources towards jurisdictions that work with companies to help monitor and enforce zero deforestation. Finally, Lula will be able to attract more international finance to end deforestation in Brazil, which is a necessary complement to individual companies' supply chain policies. With this momentum, zero deforestation in the Amazon may become a reality and inspire hope for other at-risk ecosystems throughout the world.

2024-01-12,Deforestation in Brazil's savanna region surges to highest level since 2019,268,"RIO DE JANEIRO — Deforestation surged in Brazil's Cerrado, a vast tropical savanna region, by nearly 45% in 2023 compared to 2022, according to full-December data released Friday by the government's monitoring agency. The National Institute for Space Research reported that 7,852 square kilometers of vegetation had been torn down in the Cerrado biome between January and December 2023, especially in the states of Maranhao, Bahia and Tocantins. This is the highest level since 2019, when the agency recorded its first full year of deforestation in the Cerrado, home to more than 800 species of birds and nearly 200 mammals, according to the Switzerland-based non-profit World Wildlife Fund, or 30% of the nation's total biodiversity. Since taking office a year ago, President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has halved Amazon deforestation, which reached a 15-year high under his predecessor, Jair Bolsonaro. Even though results have been uneven, the leftist leader has promised to promote development in the region that makes sustainable use of its resources. Unlike in the Amazon, most deforestation in the Cerrado occurs on private land and part of it is legal, said Ane Alencar, science director at the Amazon Environmental Research Institute, or IPAM, a Brazilian nonprofit. Since a vast majority of the federal government's operations are in public forested areas, other actions must be taken, she said. In the Cerrado, land owners are allowed to cut down between 65% and 80% of trees on their properties, compared to 20% in the Amazon, which also has a lot more protected areas, such as natural reserves and Indigenous territories. “Many people are saying that the Cerrado is being offered as a sacrifice,” said Alencar, the IPAM science director. “Internationally, the Cerrado is not very well known. If it had a name like the Amazon, we would have more (public) policies that benefit the conservation of the biome.” Some of the most emblematic animals include jaguars, giant armadillos and anteaters, tapirs and maned wolves. The region is also one of Brazil’s major water reserves. The situation in the Cerrado comes in contrast with Lula's vow to end net deforestation by 2030 — two years beyond his current term. Brazil is hiring new personnel for its understaffed environmental agencies and the nation also announced in September that it will provide financial support to municipalities that have most reduced deforestation. The measure, however, only applies to the Amazon region, not the Cerrado."
2024-03-29,France's Macron embraces Brazil's Lula — and the memes poking fun at their 'wedding',269,"RIO DE JANEIRO — If social media is to be believed, French President Emmanuel Macron's trip to Brazil that ended Thursday left him swooning. Pictures showed him and his Brazilian counterpart, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, ambling through the Amazon and posing beneath the soaring canopy in white button-down shirts. Then there they were again, standing close and clasping hands on a boat as Macron looked adoringly at Lula, both leaders' faces lit by a gentle sun. There were hugs and handshakes aplenty; smiles and selfies, too. Lula on Thursday bestowed the highest honor for a non-citizen on Macron, draping a medal around his neck. Brazilian social media gobbled up the bonhomie with gusto, and users posted photos of the duo that many said looked more like a wedding album than a state visit. On the last evening of his trip, Macron joined in. “Some people compared the images of my visit to Brazil with those of a wedding, and I say to them: It was a wedding!” he posted on X along with a photo of himself and Lula photoshopped onto the movie poster from “La La Land” in place of Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone. “France loves Brazil and Brazil loves France!” Lula replied to his post with the flags of their two nations and an emoji of swirling hearts. Their meeting represented something of a rapprochement after relations soured between Macron and Lula's predecessor, far-right President Jair Bolsonaro, as Amazon deforestation surged to a 15-year high on his watch. And during 2023, the first year of his latest presidential term, Lula irked European leaders with claims that both Ukraine and Russia had decided to go to war and that the U.S. and European Union were “stimulating” the fighting. That drew sharp rebukes from both. Macron's absence had also been noticed at the Amazon Summit in the Brazilian city of Belem last year. He instead sent France's ambassador to Brazil, representing its Amazonian territory of French Guiana. Deforestation in Lula’s first year in office fell by about half, to a five-year low. The first day of Macron's visit took him precisely to Belem, which will host the COP30 climate conference in 2025. He and Lula announced a plan to spend 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) in the Amazon, including parts of the rainforest in French Guiana. The next day, they launched a submarine built with French technology at a shipyard outside Rio de Janeiro. It wasn't all roses. Addressing executives in Sao Paulo, Macron criticized the trade deal that Lula is pushing for the EU and South America's Mercosur bloc, saying it is “terrible” and outdated and needs reworking to take climate change into account. Macron has been the most outspoken among European leaders in opposing the trade deal. Lula told reporters Thursday that the proposal as it stands is much more promising. Before Macron's departure, Lula gifted him with five of Brazil's best cheeses, so that “he can tell me what he thought of them,” the Brazilian leader wrote Thursday night on X. Macron, for his part, didn't immediately comment."
2023-12-14,"Brazil’s Congress Weakens Protection of Indigenous Lands, Defying Lula",270,"While Brazil vows to fight climate change, lawmakers approved a law making it harder for Indigenous tribes to block deforestation, overriding a veto by President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. Brazilian officials served up an array of plans and figures at the recent COP28 climate summit in Dubai, presenting itself as a world leader, on track to protect its forests and the people who live there. But on Thursday, Brazil’s Congress approved a law that threatens Indigenous people’s rights to most of the land they inhabit or claim, potentially opening vast territories to deforestation, farming and mining. The new law requires that Indigenous people must provide concrete evidence that they occupied the land they claim on Oct. 5, 1988, when the country’s current Constitution was enacted — a requirement that many of them have little or no hope of meeting. Under the new rule, not only can Indigenous land claims currently going through the legal process be thrown out for lacking such documentation, but established legal protections for Indigenous territories can also be challenged in court and rescinded. “We have watched the entire world at COP28 saying that we need to change the direction the planet is taking,” said the leftist congressman Tarcísio Motta, who voted against the bill, “but congress has just withdrawn the rights from the people who point to the future of the planet.” Studies have repeatedly shown that protected Indigenous territories have helped prevent Amazon deforestation, meaning the forest can better store carbon to fight climate change. In September, Brazil’s Supreme Court ruled against a 1988 cutoff date for Indigenous land claims, but backers of the new law, who include powerful agricultural interests, hope it will change the legal calculus. The Congress passed the legislation last month, but President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva quickly vetoed most of its provisions. Then on Thursday, the House and Senate overrode the president’s veto, with many of his own allies joining his opponents in voting to defy him. Lawmakers also recently passed a measure that environmentalists call the “poison bill,” which relaxes rules on pesticides, and sent it to the president. The Congress “has agreed with the agenda of the agribusiness caucus and of environmental setbacks,” said Marcio Astrini, the executive-secretary of the Climate Observatory, a network of environmental and civil society organizations in Brazil. The law on Indigenous lands is expected to take effect by next week. Legal experts expect it to be challenged in the Supreme Court, and members of Apib, a leading Indigenous rights movement in Brazil, have already prepared a request for the court to review it. Yet it could take months or more for the court to rule on the case, and environmentalists and Indigenous rights activists fear the harm that could be done by then. “We will watch total chaos in jurisprudence and threats to the lives of these vulnerable people who depend on state action and on these territories to survive”, said Beto Marubo, an Indigenous leader and advocate of Indigenous rights from the Javari Valley of the Amazon basin, home to some of the most isolated people in Brazil. Brazil has more than 1.7 million Indigenous people, according to official figures, and more than half live in the Amazon region. But only 20 percent of households with at least one Indigenous person live within designated Indigenous territories. Those who do live in the territories already struggle against illegal forest-clearing for ranching and mining, and live with legal uncertainty, but the rate of deforestation is much lower in the Indigenous territories than elsewhere. Across Brazil, 483 such territories have been granted full legal protection, and 278 others are going through the process to gain protection, according to FUNAI, a government agency. Altogether, they cover more than 1.1 million square kilometers, or about 425,000 square miles, the size of Texas and California combined, almost 14 percent of Brazil’s area. Advocacy groups say that under the new law, more than 90 percent of these lands could have protection lifted, and they have called out the government for undermining Mr. Lula’s environmental agenda, including preservation of the Amazon rainforest. “It is a very contradictory situation for the country to have a policy to cut deforestation, and, on the other hand, have a Congress that fights tirelessly to end the richest instrument we have for protecting the Amazon: the Indigenous lands,” said Mr. Astrini. Indigenous and environmental groups say that tribes with traditional lifestyles can have occupied an area for centuries without having any way to prove it. Some have had only passing contact with the developed world. Congressmen who support the law argue it is needed to give landowners confidence that their land would not be taken from them, which would also create a better business environment for agriculture. “What is happening today, with the overturning of the veto on the ‘time frame bill,’ is admirable because it brings legal certainty to those who own rural properties in Brazil,” said Márcio Bittar, a right-wing senator. But it is the Indigenous whose land has been — and is being — taken from them, their advocates say, and the law ignores their history of dispossession and marginalization. Outside of the government buildings in Brasília on Thursday, at least 100 Indigenous people and their supporters, including the government’s minister of the Indigenous Peoples, Sônia Guajajara, protested the bill as lawmakers inside voted to override the veto. Afterward, they headed to the nearby Supreme Court building to symbolically file their request for review. Flávia Milhorance reported from Rio de Janeiro and Paulo Motoryn from Brasília.

2023-11-11,Deforestation in Brazilian Amazon Falls to a Five-Year Low,271,"Tree loss was down 20 percent from the previous year, the environment minister announced. Deforestation in the Amazon rainforest in Brazil fell to a five-year low, the country's National Institute of Space Research announced on Thursday, a sign that Brazil, which has the biggest share of tropical forest in the world, was making progress on its pledge to halt all deforestation by the end of the decade.   The institute reported that 3,500 square miles had been clear-cut between August 2022 and July 2023, a 22.3 percent decrease from the same period a year earlier. The decline in tree loss is estimated to have reduced the country's greenhouse gas emissions by 7.5 percent. Brazil is the world's sixth largest emitter, by some measures.  ''Behind this was a political decision,'' Marina Silva, Brazil's environment minister, said on Thursday at a news conference. ''We are changing the image of the country when we change this reality.''  The announcement was an encouraging sign that local policies could change the trajectory of global forest loss. The world lost 10.2 million acres of primary forest in 2022, a 10 percent increase from the year before, according to an annual survey by the World Resources Institute. Brazil accounted for more than 40 percent of the destruction recorded.  The results were announced almost a year after President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva took office in January. He said in his October 2022 victory speech that Brazil was ''ready to resume its leading role in the fight against the climate crisis.''  Two-thirds of the deforestation happened before Mr. Lula came into office, the government said. Under his predecessor, Jair Bolsonaro, deforestation rates climbed to a 15-year high as Mr. Bolsonaro's administration loosened environmental protection policies.  Environmental fines in the Amazon more than doubled under Mr. Lula, the government reported, as his administration sought to rebuild the forest's protection policies. Almost all of the deforestation in Brazil's Amazon rainforest is illegal, mostly the result of land grabbing and farmers' replacing trees with pasture.  Brazil isn't the only country making progress in the region. Colombia, which has a tenth of the Amazon rainforest, announced on Tuesday that deforestation rates there had fallen by 70 percent in the first nine months of the year.  But El Niño, the climate pattern that has helped cause a historic drought fueling major wildfires in the region, may jeopardize some of the progress in the region, the environment ministers of both countries acknowledged.  Wildfires have consumed more than 18,000 square miles of the Brazilian Amazon in the first nine months of the year, an area twice the size of Vermont.  More than a third of fires raging in the Brazilian Amazon are destroying old-growth forests, Ms. Silva said.

2023-08-08,Brazil is hosting the Amazon nations in a bid to save the world's largest rainforest,275,"Link to Image The eight South American countries that share the Amazon met in Brazil on Tuesday (Aug. 8) to outline a conservation strategy for the sprawling rainforest. The two-day summit, held in the city of Belém, marks the first time the Amazon Cooperation Treaty Organization (ACTO) has gathered in 12 years. The organization's resurgence is tied to the victory of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, known as Lula, in last year's Brazilian presidential election. Returning to office after 13 years, the progressive politician replaced Jair Bolsonaro, who undid decades of progress against deforestation during his four-year term. The ACTO nations-Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Peru, Suriname, and Venezuela-are expected to join Lula's campaign pledge to halt all deforestation in the Amazon by 2030. They will also negotiate reforms aimed at preventing illegal mining and logging in the region. The landmark conference comes at a pivotal time for the Amazon, which climate scientists have warned is approaching a ""point of no return,"" where deforestation would result in the destruction of the biome. The forest is the world's largest carbon sink, storing as much as 733 gigatons of carbon, so it's a major factor in the global fight against climate change. The gathering will also expose rifts between theregion's left-wing leaders. Colombian president Gustavo Petro publicly called on Lula to reject a major oil drilling project near the mouth of the Amazon River, despite the potential for economic development in one of Brazil's poorest areas. In his first stint as president, Lula leveraged resource extraction projects to fund extensive social welfare programs, while still pursuing environmental goals. He has yet to announce his final decision on the oil project. Quotable: A new era in the Amazon ""Brazil is back""-Lula, in a speech to the COP27 climate conference last year, soon after his election win. Now, with the ACTO conference, he's trying to put his plans into action Amazon deforestation, by the digits: 33.6%: Decrease in deforestation across the Amazon during Lula's first six months in office. 17%: Share of the Amazon that has already been cleared by loggers.

Data from a system called Deter, which managed by Brazil's National Institute for Space Research, showed that between January and June this year, the rainforest had alerts for possible deforestation covering 2,650 square kilometers (1,023 square miles), down from 4,000 square kilometers during the same period last year under Bolsonaro. ""The effort of reversing the curve of growth has been reached. That is a fact: we reversed the curve; deforestation isn't increasing,"" João Paulo Capobianco, the Environment Ministry's executive secretary, during a presentation. While it appears that Lula is making good on his campaign pledges to rein in illegal logging and undo the environmental crisis, it may be premature to celebrate the win. The dry season, when deforestation tends to jump, starts in June, and fires usually peak between July and November. And the picture for June wasn't promising. Last month, there were 3,075 fires in the Amazon-the most since 2007. But this wasn't the Lula government's doing apparently. The jump is due to clearing of areas deforested in the second half of 2022, Jair Schmitt, head of environmental protection at Ibama, Brazil's federal environmental agency, told The Associated Press. Quotable: Brazil is curbing Amazon deforestation ""Brazil will once again become a global reference in sustainability, tackling climate change, and achieving targets for carbon emission reduction and zero deforestation,"" -Lula in a speech in early June, when his government laid out its plans to halt deforestation in the Amazon by 2030 Amazon deforestation, by the digits 60%: How much of the Amazon rainforest lies in Brazil 40 million: People who live in the Amazon, including over 500 indigenous and ethnic groups 2 billion: Trees felled in the Amazon during Bolsonaro's four years as president. That's 15 per second 10%: Reduction in environment-related staffing in Bolsonaro's government 1,500: New pesticides approved under Bolsonaro's rule; many with ingredients that are banned in the EU 20: Environmental activists killed in Brazil in 2021 (Bolsonaro has called environmental NGOs ""cancers"") 17%: Forest's area that has been lost as of last year. At 20-25%-which would've been breached under Bolsonaro-the Amazon would reach a ""tipping point"" after which it would lose its ability to regenerate trees, and large areas would become savannah, affecting its ability to absorb carbon emissions. In 2021, parts of the Amazon were already emitting more greenhouse gasses than they were absorbing 72%: How much Amazon's deforestation rate declined between 2004 and 2016, during Lula and the Workers' party's previous terms in office 89%: Expected decrease in Amazon deforestation over the next decade in case of a Bolsonaro defeated in the 2022 Brazilian presidential election, as per an October 2022 Carbon Brief analysis Person of Interest: Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva aka Lula The left-wing leader garnered huge popularity for his welfare policies, making strides in solving Brazil's hunger crisis and redistributing wealth, lifting at least 20 million Brazilians out of poverty, when he was president between 2003 and 2010. However, the septuagenarian couldn't run for office in 2018 because of corruption and money laundering convictions the year prior. But these were voided by the Brazilian Supreme Court in 2021. He came back last year with plans of environmental policy overhaul-including tackling illegal logging, aiming for net-zero deforestation, and delivering on emissions targets. He also publicly committed to policies such as introducing carbon pricing and issuing new financial incentives for sustainable farming. Getting Brazil's climate action back on track Brazil is the largest economy, greenhouse gas emitter, and energy consumer in South America, but the impact of its climate action reverberates across the world as the Amazon rainforest is one of the planet's largest carbon sinks. Further deforestation would create dire circumstances comprising worsening air quality, severe drought, loss of biodiversity and extinction of endangered species, rise in respiratory disease, a heightened risk of ""zoonotic spillover"" that would cause more pandemics, and an increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events around the globe. The Lula government is aware of those risks and is taking steps to mitigate the threats. It has strengthened remote surveillance via satellite imagery, the AP reported, citing Schmitt. By cross-referencing land records, owners of deforested areas are identified and sanctioned with restricted access to financial loans and other measures.  The government has doubled deforestation fines and it has also been seizing illegally raised cattle within embargoed areas. It's a form of ""immediate punishment"" instead of relying on a rarely-footed slow-moving fines and appeals process, Schmitt said. But there's one gap left to fill: Lula needs more environmental officers. The Brazilian government's environmental agency, Ibama, had no new hires between 2014 and 2020. Combined with Bolsonaro's trimming of the federal agency headcount, the leftover workforce is sparse and overworked. The number of Ibama's enforcement agents is at its lowest in 24 years. The are just 700 agents, with 150 available for deployment. And beefing up the staff is a long and winding process. The government put out a call for new Ibama hires, but it takes at least 10 months before new agents are in the field, due to rules about public-sector hiring and training for such dangerous missions.

2023-08-09,8 Nations Reach Pact to Protect Amazon Rainforest,277,"The eight countries that comprise the Amazon River basin agreed on several initiatives to curtail deforestation in the world's largest and most important rainforest. On Tuesday, the leaders of eight countries that are home to the Amazon River basin agreed to work together to conserve the world's largest rainforest at a groundbreaking meeting convened by President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva of Brazil.   The agreement, called the Belém Declaration, for the Brazilian city where the meeting was held, provides a road map to stave off the rampant deforestation, caused in large part by industrial agriculture and land-grabbing, that has severely damaged the rainforest and has major implications for Earth's climate.  The meeting was also expected to yield a separate agreement on Wednesday among other nations with major rainforests -- including the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Republic of Congo and Indonesia -- to more closely coordinate protecting the ecosystems globally.  The Amazon rainforest is not only a haven of biodiversity but also plays an important role in the fight against climate change because it pulls huge amounts of planet-warming carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and stores it away. Over the past half-century, around 17 percent of the forest has been razed and an even bigger share is severely degraded.  Numerous studies have indicated that further deforestation would be disastrous to tens of thousands of species and transform the Amazon into a net emitter, rather than absorber, of greenhouse gases. Parts of it have already reached that point.  The summit meeting was part of Mr. Lula's efforts to galvanize a climate-conscious coalition of countries seven months after he unseated Jair Bolsonaro, whose four-year term as president was marked by strident support for Brazil's right to clear vast tracts of land for its economic benefit.  Mr. Lula made Amazon protection a cornerstone of his election campaign. Deforestation rates have dropped by 42 percent during his tenure, according to preliminary satellite imaging data.  ''The Amazon is our passport to a new relationship with the world, a more symmetrical relationship in which our resources will not be exploited for the benefit of a few, but valued and placed at the service of all,'' Mr. Lula said in a speech at the meeting.  The agreement sets the groundwork for coordination between the Amazon basin's eight countries on law enforcement to combat widespread illegal mining and logging, as well as between banks assigned to pool development funds for conservation and sustainable employment for the region's inhabitants. It also creates an Amazon-specific climate-focused scientific panel.  While the agreement projected symbolic unity, it fell short of the biggest ambitions Mr. Lula had hoped to realize.  For months before the summit, Mr. Lula pushed the leaders of Bolivia and Venezuela to commit to ending deforestation in their countries by 2030, a pledge the six other Amazon basin countries had already made at the global climate summit in Glasgow in 2021. Colombia's president, Gustavo Petro, who has adopted the region's most progressive policies on conservation, had in turn pushed Mr. Lula to match his commitment to ban all oil drilling the forest, but Brazil still has plans for a huge offshore project at the mouth of the Amazon River.  Neither push succeeded.  Eduardo Viola, who studies environmental international affairs at the Fundação Getúlio Vargas in Brazil, said there was no doubt the summit marked the most significant step Amazon countries have made to protect the forest, but it may not be enough. ''The commitments vary a lot, and the implementation capacity outside Brazil is low, or very low,'' he said.  The expected announcement on Wednesday of further cooperation among other countries that are home to the most of the rest of the world's rainforests could include efforts to increase access to financing from wealthier nations that would promote sustainable forest use.  The foundation for that agreement was laid last year at COP27, the United Nations-sponsored global climate summit, which was held in Egypt. Belém, the city where this week's Amazon negotiations have taken place, is set to host COP30 in 2025.  The meeting in Belém provided Mr. Lula and others a venue to harshly criticize wealthy countries, particularly Western ones, for not delivering on a promise made in at the U.N. climate summit in 2009 to provide $100 billion in climate finance annually to poorer nations.  Historically, leftists in the region have pushed for more environmental protections. Mr. Lula and Mr. Petro, whose countries are home to nearly three-quarters of the remaining Amazon rainforest, went beyond that and have made conservation a cornerstone of their presidencies.  Under Mr. Petro, Colombia has sought to position itself as a leader on climate issues, with a push to phase out oil drilling, which would be a first for any of the world's oil-drilling nations.  Despite the projection of unity, analysts said political crises wracking numerous Amazon Basin countries contributed to the limited scope of the Belém Declaration. Under the authoritarian leadership of Nicolás Maduro, Venezuela is enduring a crushing economic meltdown. Peru has had five presidents in the past four years. And Ecuador is holding early elections this month after its president dissolved Congress.  Neither the Venezuelan nor the Ecuadorean president was present at the summit. https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/08/climate/amazon-rainforest-belem-protections.html Graphic   PHOTO: From left, Presidents Gustavo Petro of Colombia, Luis Inácio Lula da Silva of Brazil and Luis Arce of Bolivia on Tuesday in Belém, Brazil, where they and five other leaders signed a conservation deal.

2024-04-05,Millions of Acres of Forest Vanish in Year,279,"Wildfires and agricultural expansion offset big gains in protecting tropical forests last year. Despite major progress in protecting vast tracts of rainforest, the world failed again last year to significantly slow the pace of global forest destruction, according to a report issued on Thursday. Record wildfires in Canada and expanding agriculture elsewhere offset big gains in forest protection in Brazil and Colombia, the report found.   The annual survey by the World Resources Institute, a research organization, found that the world lost 9.1 million acres of primary tropical forest in 2023, equivalent to an area almost the size of Switzerland, about 9 percent less than the year before. But the improvement failed to put the world on course to halt all forest loss by 2030, a commitment made by 145 nations at a global climate talks in Glasgow in 2021 and reaffirmed by all countries last year.  ''Global leaders sent an undeniable message that forests are critical to meeting global climate goals,'' said Rod Taylor, the global director for forests at the World Resources Institute. But, he added, ''we are far off track and trending in the wrong direction.''  The immense wildfires in Canada last year destroyed such a huge tract of boreal forests, almost three times as much as in any other year, that they turned what would have been a 4 percent decrease in global forest loss into a 24 percent increase over last year.  The report focuses on the tropics because deforestation and fires there are mostly caused by human activity and can create longer-lasting consequences. The humid forests of tropical countries hold a quarter of all carbon stored on land and are home to a large share of animal and plant species, making their protection essential both to curb climate change and to avert biodiversity loss.  Researchers at the World Resources Institute, working in collaboration with the University of Maryland, documented tree loss across the world from deforestation, fires and other causes. Last year's destruction resulted in 2.4 gigatons of carbon dioxide emissions, which is roughly equivalent to half of what the burning of fossil fuels in the United States produces each year.  Still, last year's results showed that progress is possible when forest protection becomes a priority for world leaders. A recent change in leadership in Brazil and Colombia, which together hold almost a third of the world's tropical forests, produced a steep decrease in deforestation rates in the two countries.  Brazil lost 2.8 million acres of forest last year, 36 percent less than in 2022. Ahead of taking office in 2023, President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva said the country was ''ready to resume its leading role in the fight against the climate crisis.'' Brazil, which is home to more than half of the Amazon rainforest, accounted for 30 percent of the tropical forest loss globally last year.  Colombia, where President Gustavo Petro took office in 2022 vowing to protect the rainforest, recorded an even steeper improvement, slashing deforestation rates by 49 percent. Both Brazil and Colombia increased funding for environmental protection, created new programs to develop sustainable economic alternatives for rainforest regions and made efforts to protect local communities who defend forests.  But there are concerns about how permanent those gains will be. In Indonesia, one of the countries that has made the most progress in fighting deforestation over the past decade, tree loss has started ticking up again in the last two years.  ''Ephemeral victories or ephemeral progress in slowing deforestation may not be progress at all,'' said Matthew Hansen, the co-director of a laboratory at the University of Maryland that investigates changes in land use around the world.  But even the gains that researchers documented last year were largely offset by the expansion of agribusiness into tropical ecosystems around the world. The World Resources Institute researchers linked rising deforestation in Bolivia and Laos to the expansion of farms with the goal of increasing exports.  Forest loss in the Congo River Basin, the second-largest tropical forest area in the world, remained persistent last year, as economic hardship continued to drive communities to convert trees into firewood and charcoal for cooking.  Last year, man-made climate change fueled the record-breaking wildfires in Canada and seemed to leave its fingerprints around the world.  In Bolivia, blazes are also growing larger and burning the same areas repeatedly. It's too early to say whether they were fueled by climate change. But the phenomenon has raised questions about whether some heavily degraded areas of the Amazon are transforming into different ecosystems, which some researchers worry could lead to a gradual forest-wide collapse.  Still, there is a lot governments, companies and communities can do to combat forest loss, beyond curbing the carbon emissions that cause climate change, said Mr. Taylor, the World Resources Institute director. New regulations and subsidies for forest protection could help, he said.  Unfortunately, these initiatives aren't happening globally at a significant scale, Mr. Taylor said, ''and that's why we still see deforestation rates persisting.'' https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/04/climate/global-forest-tree-loss-wri.html Graphic   PHOTO: A burned forest in Alberta.

2023-07-06,"In Lula's first six months, Brazil Amazon deforestation dropped 34%, reversing trend under Bolsonaro",281,"RIO DE JANEIRO — After four years of rising destruction in Brazil’s Amazon, deforestation dropped by 33.6% during the first six months of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva’s term, according to government satellite data released Thursday. From January to June the rainforest had alerts for possible deforestation covering 2,650 square kilometers , down from 4,000 square kilometers — an area the size of Rhode Island — during the same period last year under former President Jair Bolsonaro. This year's data includes a 41% plunge in alerts for June, which marks the start of the dry season when deforestation tends to jump. ""The effort of reversing the curve of growth has been reached. That is a fact: we reversed the curve; deforestation isn't increasing,"" João Paulo Capobianco, the Environment Ministry's executive secretary, said during a presentation in Brasilia. Capobianco noted that full-year results will depend on a few challenging months ahead. Still, the data is an encouraging sign for Lula, who campaigned last year with pledges to rein in illegal logging and undo the environmental devastation during Bolsonaro’s term. The former far-right leader weakened environmental authorities while his insistence on development of the Amazon region resonated with landgrabbers and farmers who had long felt maligned by environmental laws. They were emboldened, and Amazon deforestation surged to a 15-year high. Thursday's deforestation data comes from a system called Deter, managed by the National Institute for Space Research, a federal agency. It is an initiative mainly focused on detecting real-time deforestation. The most accurate deforestation calculations come from another system called Prodes, with data released only annually. “Bottom line, we are prioritizing environmental law enforcement,” Jair Schmitt, head of environmental protection at Ibama, Brazil’s federal environmental agency, said in a phone interview with The Associated Press. However, the continued shortage of personnel means the task hasn't been easy, he said. Many Ibama agents retired and weren't replaced during Bolsonaro’s administration, reflecting his effort to defang environmental authorities. Lula has committed to restoring the workforce, but the number of Ibama’s enforcement agents remains at its lowest in 24 years. For the entire country that is bigger than the contiguous U.S., there are just 700 agents, with 150 available for deployment. Ibama has also strengthened remote surveillance, where deforestation is detected through satellite imagery, according to Schmitt. By cross-referencing with land records, it is possible to identify the owner of the area in many cases, leading to an embargo that restricts access to financial loans and imposes other sanctions. Another strategy has been to seize thousands of illegally raised cattle within embargoed areas. It is effective because it inflicts immediate punishment, whereas fines are rarely paid in Brazil due to a slow appeals process, Schmitt said. Rodrigo Agostinho, the head of Ibama, noted in the presentation Thursday that the value of fines imposed in the first half of the year jumped 167% from the 2019-2022 average, and the agency embargoed 2,086 areas — up 111%. “We started the year with a lot of difficulty because of everything we inherited, reorganizing all the enforcement teams, environmental protection, reactivating tech systems,” said Agostinho. Improved deforestation data also reflect the change in rhetoric coming from the top, said Schmitt. Whereas Bolsonaro openly criticized Ibama and advocated for the legalization of deforested areas, Lula has said he will rebuild law enforcement and promised to expel invaders from protected areas. Experts say the mere expectation that a land-grabbed area will eventually be regularized has historically been one of deforestation's biggest drivers. It may be premature to celebrate the reversal in deforestation's trend, however. According to satellite monitoring, there were 3,075 fires in the Amazon in June alone, which marks the beginning of the dry season — the most since 2007. The jump is due to the clearing of areas deforested in the second half of 2022, Schmitt said. In the Amazon, fires are mostly man-made and occur after clear-cutting of the forest. With El Niño looming, which typically brings less rain and higher temperatures to the Amazon, Ibama has doubled its budget for fighting forest fires and increased the scope of its fire squads by 17% for the most critical period, typically July to October. Approximately half of the 2,117 temporary firefighters are Indigenous peoples. The Amazon rainforest covers an area twice the size of India and holds tremendous stores of carbon, serving as a crucial buffer against climate change. Two-thirds of it is located in Brazil. Next month, Lula will preside over a meeting in Belem, bringing together heads-of-state from all Amazonian nations to discuss means to effectively cooperate in the challenging region. Lula has promised to end net deforestation in Brazil's Amazon by 2030. His four-year mandate, his third term, ends two years earlier. To achieve this, law enforcement alone will not be enough, says Adevaldo Dias, a rubber-tapper leader who presides over the Chico Mendes Memorial, a non-profit organization that assists traditional non-Indigenous communities in the Amazon. “It is necessary to invest in sustainable productive chains under community management, such as managed pirarucu (arapaima) fishing, Brazil nuts, vegetable oils, and açai,” he told the AP. “This will help revitalize and expand these chains, generating decent income for those engaged in conservation efforts within their territories.” Ibama's Agostinho also stressed his agency's efforts within Indigenous territories, particularly the land of the Yanomami people where thousands of illegal gold miners — seeking to carve out a living — invaded during Bolsonaro's term. Their activities contaminated waterways and sickened local people, and Lula's government has spent months expelling most of them. Some remain, however, working at night to avoid being caught, Agostinho said. “We are very content with the result so far,"" he said. ""We know the fight isn’t over, we will continue doing this work.” ___ Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

2023-07-08,The presidents of Brazil and Colombia meet to boost cooperation ahead of Amazon summit,282,"RIO DE JANEIRO — Brazil’s President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva on Saturday met with his Colombian counterpart Gustavo Petro to build momentum for an upcoming regional summit on the Amazon rainforest and enhance efforts for its protection. The encounter took place in Colombia’s Leticia, a town in the Amazon’s triple border region between Colombia, Brazil and Peru, where organized crime has recently increased its hold. The meeting aimed to lay groundwork for the Amazon Summit the Brazilian government is organizing in Belem next month. That summit will be attended by leaders of the countries party to the Amazon Cooperation Treaty Organization, made up of Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Peru, Suriname, and Venezuela. Lula is pushing for a joint declaration from the summit, which would be presented at the United Nation’s climate conference, known as COP28, in Dubai in November. ""We will have to demand together that rich countries fulfil their commitments,"" Lula said in Leticia, sitting next to Petro. Petro also stressed the need for a common front to exert pressure on developed countries. “We believed that progress was the destruction of trees. ... Today that is nothing other than the destruction of life,” he said. The Colombian leader said tackling the climate crisis will require spending trillions of dollars. This could be achieved by transforming the global debt system and “trading debt for climate action,” he said. The final document will comprise measures for the sustainable development of the Amazon, protecting the biome, and promoting social inclusion, science, technology and innovation while valuing Indigenous peoples and their knowledge, Brazil’s presidential palace said in a statement. “Joint action of the countries that share the Amazon biome is fundamental for facing the multiple challenges in the region,” the statement said. One challenge faced is the tightened grip of organized crime, particularly in tri-border regions like where Leticia is located. British journalist Dom Phillips and Indigenous activist Bruno Pereira were killed in the neighboring Javari valley region last year. These areas have become “violent hotspots,” according to a report by the UN Office on Drugs and Crime released in June. It noted criminal groups are simultaneously engaged in cocaine production trafficking, as well as natural resource exploitation. Indigenous groups are “disproportionately affected” by the criminal nexus in the Amazon, the report added, pointing to forced displacements, mercury poisoning and other health-related impacts as well as increased exposure to violence. In 2019, Colombia, Bolivia, Ecuador, Brazil, Peru, Guyana and Suriname signed the Leticia Pact to strengthen coordinated actions for the preservation of the natural resources of the Amazon. But the goals are vague and lack ways to measure progress, said Marcio Astrini, executive secretary of the Climate Observatory, an umbrella organization of environmental groups. “It’s a letter of ambitions. We hope that in Leticia they (Lula and Petro) will increase and clarify their ambitions,” said Astrini. Since taking office in January, Lula has strived to put environmental protection and respect for Indigenous peoples’ rights at the heart of his third term. He successful pursued resumption of international donations for the Amazon Fund that combats deforestation, launched a military campaign to eject illegal miners from Yanomami territory, committed to ending all illegal deforestation by 2030 and restarted the demarcation of Indigenous areas. Lula's approach contrasts sharply with the actions of his predecessor, Jair Bolsonaro. Under the far-right leader’s term, deforestation soared to a 15-year high, and environmental restrictions were weakened. Deforestation fell by 33.6% during the first six months of Lula’s term, according to satellite data the Brazilian government released this week from the National Institute for Space Research, a federal agency. Petro has also been vocal about the need to halt destruction in the Amazon. The Colombian leader has proposed the creation of multilateral 20-year financing fund to support farming communities contributing to deforestation. The idea is to compensate them for conservation and regenerative activities instead. Historically, collaboration between Brazil and Colombia, which share a border longer than 1,500 kilometers (about 900 miles), has been lacking, according to Wagner Ribeiro, a geographer and expert in environmental policy from the University of Sao Paulo. “We hope that opportunities for academic cooperation will arise from the meeting, which will later generate public policies that promote environmental conservation,” Ribeiro said. ___ Associated Press writer Gabriela Molina in Quito, Ecuador, contributed to this report."
2023-09-26,"Brazil slows Amazon deforestation, but in Chico Mendes' homeland, it risks being too late",283,"BRASILIA, Brazil — Luzineide Marques da Silva knows the location of each of the 748 rubber trees scattered in her area of the Brazilian Amazon, where she and her family hold rights to tap the trees for latex to sell to a sneaker manufacturer. So she watched in pain and anger last week as two of them were badly damaged by a fire she said was started by one of the land-grabbers encroaching on her territory. “I see the fire engulfing my rubber trees, and I feel as if I myself were being murdered right there,” Silva told The Associated Press in an interview. “He’s burning down the trees from which I earn my livelihood, and I cherish them so much.” After nine months in office, President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has halved Amazon deforestation, which reached a 15-year high under predecessor Jair Bolsonaro, and has promised to promote development that makes sustainable use of its resources. But progress has been uneven, and in the symbolic Chico Mendes Extractive Reserve, it could be too late for scores of rubber-tapper families like Luzineide’s, who are increasingly under siege by illegal cattle ranchers. Extractive reserves are federal conservation units set aside for non-Indigenous forest communities to pursue their traditional lives protected from land-grabbing and deforestation. The areas were created after the international outcry that followed the 1988 assassination of Mendes, a rubber tapper, union leader and environmentalist, on the orders of a local cattle rancher. Despite the land's protected status, cattle trickled into the reserve in the years after it was created, and their numbers exploded during Bolsonaro's four-year rule as the far-right president tried to shrink protected areas and legalize large-scale cattle herds inside extractive reserves. Now Luzineide, who leads a family of 12, including her husband, daughters, and grandsons, fears being killed as Mendes was. Her area, with four rubber tree groves, has become a forested island surrounded by pasture and cattle. She says she has repeatedly received death threats for opposing deforestation. Her situation is not unique. The reserve this year has registered 300 fires, the second-largest figure among conservation units in the Amazon biome, according to official data. Most fires in the rainforest are human-set, either to clear the forest or manage pasture. The context is especially complex in the Chico Mendes reserve, where some former rubber tappers are eager to make more money by turning to cattle or illegally selling their rubber tree groves to ranchers. Luzineide said the federal agency in charge of managing the reserve, the Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation, also known as ICMBio, does not have enough people to curb environmental crime in the 3,600-square-mile (about 9,300 square kilometers) reserve. She said she requested their presence for weeks, but agents came only two days after the fires and briefly detained a man suspected of setting them. He was arrested for illegal possession of a weapon and released after posting bail. The ICMBio did not respond to questions from AP. But Mauro Pires, president of the institute, addressed Luzineide's case when he was asked about it on the sidelines of an ecotourism congress last week near Rio de Janeiro. Pires said the Mendes reserve had been deliberately targeted for its symbolism, and in what he called a coordinated effort to disrupt rubber tappers' lives. He suggested that Luzineide could seek help from a government program that offers protection to grassroots leaders and public servants who face threats. Marina Silva, Lula's minister of Environment and Climate Change and herself a former rubber tapper, told AP in an August interview that Bolsonaro was to blame for deforestation inside the reserve. She urged patience as the government designs an ecological transition toward a low-carbon national economy. Lula has promised to end net deforestation by 2030 — two years beyond his current term. The federal government is hiring new personnel for the understaffed environmental agencies, but the process is bureaucratic and it will take months to train new officials before being deployed for fieldwork. Mary Allegretti, an anthropologist who was a close friend of Mendes and has spent decades working to improve the lives of rubber tappers in the Amazon, said the ICMBio's response to Luzineide's pleas was “unacceptable and inexcusable.” “What is the role of ICMBio in the reserve if it can’t verify a complaint in time to prevent the burning of rubber trees, which is her livelihood?"" Allegretti said. Angela Mendes, a daughter of Mendes and herself a social activist, blamed large-scale land ownership that she said is entrenched in Brazil's political system. She said stopping continued deforestation requires electing a more diverse Congress and getting state governments and the attorney general involved against criminal activities. “These are complex issues that can be resolved with political will,"" she said. Rubber tapping has been the main source of income for Luzineide’s family for three generations. She is part of a network of 500 rubber tappers who sell their production to Veja, a French shoemaker, currently the only buyer of local rubber. About 10% of the rubber tappers are women, according to the local cooperative. “I want you to publish my story,” Luzineide said. “For this is not only my pain but also that of thousands of people who live inside the reserve. If something happens to me, if I fall, my story will already be written."" ___ This story has corrected the first name of the president of the Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation to Mauro, not Maurilo. ___ Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

2023-12-09,"Brazil's Lula takes heat on oil plans at UN climate talks, a turnaround after hero status last year",284,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Fresh off election victory, a year ago Brazilian President-elect Inacio Lula da Silva was the star of the annual U.N. climate talks. Lula promised to crack down on deforestation and turn Brazil into an environmental leader, a complete turnaround after President Jair Bolsonaro rolled back regulations and encouraged land-grabbing in the Amazon. “Lula! Lula! Lula!” many onlookers screamed during Lula’s many events at COP27 in Egypt. What a difference a year makes. Just as Lula addressed world leaders at COP28 in Dubai, it was announced that Brazil would join OPEC+, a group of big oil-exporting countries, including Russia. At one event during the conference, Lula tried to explain the decision by saying that, once on the inside, the South American nation would push other oil-producing countries to transition to green energy—a curious explanation given that state-run oil company Petrobras is focused on further oil exploration. Lula later clarified that Brazil would be an OPEC observer, not a full member. In his speech to world leaders, Lula implored delegates to go beyond “eloquent but empty words.” In a subsequent session with Environment Minister Marina Silva, Lula teared up when he talked about the need to protect forests. Instead of chants of adulation, Brazil received a Fossil of the Day award from Climate Action Network International, a non-award given to countries whose actions support fossil fuels, the main cause of climate change. Natalie Unterstell, president of Talanoa, a Brazilian think tank focused on climate, said Lula's approach to the environment was focused on curbing deforestation, Brazil's largest source of carbon emissions, which his administration has managed to slow by half since taking office in January. That approach served him well during his first terms, between 2003 and 2010, but that is no longer enough, she said. “Lula can’t be a climate leader without a real energy transition policy,” she said. “It's time for him to update his programming software.” Lula has had a long and complicated relationship with oil. When huge reserves were discovered off Brazilian shores in 2006, Lula said: “This discovery ... proves that God is Brazilian.” Indeed, as the Brazil became a major oil-producer over the next decade, the money helped Lula, and then successor President Dilma Rousseff, fund major social programs that lifted tens of millions of people from poverty. Today, Brazil is the world's ninth largest producer, with 3% of global output, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Oil has become so important that it's now Brazil's second export product after soy, producing 3.67 million barrels a day. By far, China is the country's largest buyer. At a climate conference focused on reducing planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, which oil and gas products let off when burned, environmentalists have been quick to note the contradiction. Meanwhile, Petrobras is doubling down on oil. On Dec. 13, a day after the climate conference is scheduled to end, the country is going to allow companies to bid on 33 areas with blocks for oil exploration, according to Brazil's National Agency of Oil, Natural Gas and Biofuels, including some in the Amazon rainforest. It's part of a push to offer more than 900 blocks in December. In a written response to the AP, the National Agency of Oil, Natural Gas and Biofuels declined to comment on demands for energy transition, arguing that, as a regulatory agency, it “does not create public policies but rather implements the policies formulated by the government."" The increased exploration, which eventually leads to more production, threatens to cancel out or even surpass gains from Brazil's efforts to stop net deforestation by 2030, according to the Greenhouse Gas Emission Estimation System, an initiative by the Climate Observatory, a network of environmental nonprofit groups. “The damage (of the exploration) goes against any positioning of Brazil as a climate leader,"" said David Tsai, projects coordinator at the Institute for Energy and the Environment, which is part of Climate Observatory. While Lula fumbled during the few days he spent at COP28, his Colombian counterpart, leftist Gustavo Petro, seemed to be taking the mantle of environmental leadership in Latin America. In contrast to Brazil’s alignment with OPEC, Petro joined an alliance of nations supporting a fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty. “This is not economic suicide,” he said in Dubai. “It’s about preventing humanity’s self-destruction.” The leaders' differing visions were on display in August during the Amazonian summit in Belem. Lula and other leaders vetoed Petro’s proposal to ban oil production in the world’s largest rainforest. Similar to the ongoing climate talks, oil was the most contentious topic during the meeting held in Belem.

2023-08-09,"Brazil's Amazon Summit ends with a plan to protect the world's rainforests, but no measurable goals",286,"BELEM, Brazil — Brazil’s Amazon Summit closed Wednesday with a roadmap to protect tropical rainforests that was welcomed as an important step in countering climate change, but without the concrete commitments sought by some environmentalists to end deforestation. Leaders and ministers from eight Amazon nations signed a declaration Tuesday in Belem, Brazil, that laid out plans to drive economic development in their countries while preventing the Amazon’s ongoing demise “from reaching a point of no return.” Several environmental groups described the declaration as a compilation of good intentions with little in the way of measurable goals and timeframes. However, it was lauded by others, and the Amazon’s umbrella organization of Indigenous groups celebrated the inclusion of two of its main demands. “It is significant that the leaders of the countries of the region have listened to the science and understood the call of society: the Amazon is in danger, and we do not have much time to act,” the international group WWF said in a statement. “However, WWF regrets that the eight Amazonian countries, as one front, have not reached a common point to end deforestation in the region."" Joining the summit Wednesday were the presidents of the Republic of Congo and the Democratic Republic of Congo, an emissary from Indonesia’s president, and France’s ambassador to Brazil, representing the Amazonian territory of French Guiana. An emissary of Norway, the largest contributor to Brazil’s Amazon Fund for sustainable development, also attended. The national representatives on Wednesday signed a similar, but much slimmer, agreement to that of their counterparts the prior day; it likewise contained no concrete goals and mostly reinforced criticism of developed nations for failure to provide promised vast climate financing. The eight nations attending on Tuesday — Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Peru, Suriname and Venezuela — are members of the newly revived Amazon Cooperation Treaty Organization, or ACTO, who hope that a united front will give them a major voice in global environment talks ahead of the COP 28 climate conference in November. The summit reinforces Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva's strategy to leverage global concern for the Amazon’s preservation. Emboldened by a 42% drop in deforestation during his first seven months in office, he has sought international financial support for forest protection. Speaking to reporters after Wednesday’s meeting, Lula railed against “protectionist measures poorly disguised as environmental concern” that restrict imports from developing nations, and said developed nations must make good on their pledges to provide monetary support for forest protection. “Nature, which industrial development polluted for 200 years, needs them to pay their part so we can revive part of what was ruined. Nature is in need of money,” Lula said. The Amazon stretches across an area twice the size of India. Two-thirds of it lies in Brazil, with seven other countries and the territory of French Guiana sharing the remaining third. Governments have historically viewed it as an area to be colonized and exploited, with little regard for sustainability or the rights of its Indigenous peoples. All the Amazon countries have ratified the Paris climate accord, which requires signatories to set targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. But cross-border cooperation has historically been scant, undermined by low trust, ideological differences and the lack of government presence. The members of ACTO — convening for only the fourth time in the organization’s 45-year existence — demonstrated Tuesday they aren’t fully aligned on key issues. Forest protection commitments have been uneven. And their joint declaration didn’t include a shared commitment to zero deforestation by 2030, as some had hoped. Brazil and Colombia have already made that commitment. Some scientists say that when 20% to 25% of the forest is destroyed, rainfall will dramatically decline, transforming more than half of the rainforest to tropical savannah, with immense biodiversity loss. The Climate Observatory, a network of dozens of environmental and social groups, as well as Greenpeace and The Nature Conservancy lamented the lack of detailed pledges in the declaration. “The 113 operating paragraphs of the declaration have the merit of reviving the forgotten ACTO and recognize that the biome is reaching a point of no return, but doesn’t offer practical solutions or a calendar of actions to avoid it,” the Climate Observatory said in a statement. Colombian Indigenous leader Fany Kuiru, from the Coordinating Body of Indigenous Organizations of the Amazon Basin, praised the declaration for fulfilling two of their primary requests — an acknowledgment of their rights to traditional territories and the establishment of a mechanism for the formal participation of Indigenous peoples within ACTO. Bruna Santos, director of the Brazil Institute at the Woodrow Wilson Center, said the summit demonstrated “an effort to treat the Amazon as a regional agenda,” but that it also highlighted ambiguities in the priorities of Brazil’s government, including with respect to oil exploration. Colombia’s president spoke forcefully about the hypocrisy of pushing for Amazon preservation while pursuing oil, equating it to betting “on death and destroying life."" Lula has refrained from taking a definitive stance on oil, citing the decision as a technical matter. Meanwhile, Brazil’s state-run Petrobras company has been seeking to explore for oil near the mouth of the Amazon River. Despite disagreements, there were signs of increased regional cooperation and growing global recognition of the Amazon’s importance in arresting climate change. A collective voice — along with funneling more money into ACTO — could help it serve as the region’s representative on the global stage ahead of the COP climate conference, leaders said. Anders Haug Larsen, the head of international advocacy at Rainforest Foundation Norway, said that the Amazonian nations are correct to demand more money from developed nations, and that their political will to protect the rainforest represents a historic opportunity. “With the plan from this summit and continuous reduced deforestation, this is where the international community should put its climate money,” he said. ___ Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

2023-12-20,Brazilian State Seeks Millions in Environmental Damages From Giant Meatpacker,287,"Rondônia State officials say JBS, the world’s biggest meat producer, is buying cattle raised in an illegally deforested Amazon reserve. The Brazilian authorities are seeking millions of dollars in damages and fines from the world’s biggest meatpacker, JBS, and three smaller slaughterhouses, according to court filings that accuse them of buying cattle raised on illegally deforested lands in the Amazon rainforest. The lawsuits come as JBS is pursuing a listing on the New York Stock Exchange, which would give the company expanded access to capital. They are expected to increase pressure on the company, which was recently the subject of a Senate hearing because of its supply chain’s links to deforestation. The United States is JBS’s largest market. The 17 suits, brought by Rondônia State, in the country’s west, say that the companies have bought cattle raised in one of the Amazon’s most devastated protected areas, the Jaci-Paraná Extractive Reserve, which has lost 77 percent of its forest cover since it was created in 1996. Dozens of members of the traditional communities there have left in fear of the land-grabbers and ranchers who have taken over most of the reserve. JBS is the biggest purchaser of cattle from the Amazon rainforest, and experts say ranching is the biggest driver of deforestation there. Forest destruction, coupled with climate change, is already transforming humid ecosystems that store huge amounts of planet-warming gases into drier zones that instead release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. The result is a double blow against efforts to combat climate change and biodiversity loss. A Times investigation in 2021 found that leather from cattle raised in Jaci-Paraná had ended up on the seats of pickup trucks, S.U.V.s and other vehicles sold by some of the world’s largest automakers. JBS was a key supplier of the leather. At the time, it disputed allegations that it had bought cattle raised on illegally deforested lands. In a statement on Wednesday, JBS said that it runs a robust monitoring system in Brazil that covers an area three times the size of Britain to guarantee its suppliers do not occupy any areas illegally. “JBS is committed to a sustainable beef supply chain,” the company said. Three of the 17 lawsuits, which were first reported by The Associated Press and Agência Pública, are against JBS and a group of farmers who are accused of selling the company cattle raised on farms in the reserve. The other suits are against three smaller meatpackers that are accused of buying hundreds of cattle raised in the reserve. The Rondônia State authorities say farmers sold 227 cattle raised on about 1,000 acres of illegally deforested land to JBS between 2019 and 2021. The state is seeking almost $3.5 million in damages from the company and the farmers. It is also imposing fines of more than $400,000 on JBS, though those could be challenged in court. Attorneys for the state did not reply to a request for comment. JBS has made some progress in compliance in recent years, after federal prosecutors in Pará State filed lawsuits seeking environmental damages from a group of meatpackers in 2009. Prosecutors did not win the case but went on to establish a program that audits cattle purchases. An audit of JBS’s cattle purchases in Pará found that 6 percent had come from so-called irregular ranches, a steep drop from 2020, when an audit found that 32 percent of animals had come from irregular sources. The same audit in Rondônia this year found that 12 percent of cattle purchases by JBS did not comply with the law. Under the administration of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, deforestation rates in the Brazilian part of the rainforest have fallen to a five-year low over the past 12 months. “There are signs things are improving,” said Paulo Barreto, a researcher who focuses on cattle ranching at Imazon, a nonprofit research organization based in Belém, Brazil. But, he added, change was not coming fast enough. Governments come and go, he said, so “this stronger commitment from companies is very important to signal to politicians that things won’t go back to the way they were before.” Lawsuits that seek to hold meatpackers responsible for deforestation are rare, Mr. Barreto said. That’s partly because purchases of cattle raised in illegally deforested lands are often hard to trace; they go through middlemen who present documents falsely attesting that the animals came from legal farms, the 2021 Times investigation found. Daniel Azeredo, a federal prosecutor who has been investigating cattle ranching for more than a decade, said the Rondônia lawsuits “strengthen the need for the country to improve traceability.” Without that, he added, “we will keep having the same problems.” A judge in Rondônia, Pedro Sillas Carvalho, signaled doubts about the lawsuits brought by the state, according to one filing from last week. He wrote that the state attorneys needed to factor in the economic effects of their actions, because the exit of illegal farmers from the reserve could cause “loss of revenue.” The Times was unable to reach Judge Sillas Carvalho for comment.

A collective voice — along with funneling more money into ACTO — could help it serve as the region’s representative on the global stage ahead of the COP climate conference, leaders said. Anders Haug Larsen, the head of international advocacy at Rainforest Foundation Norway, said that the Amazonian nations are correct to demand more money from developed nations, and that their political will to protect the rainforest represents a historic opportunity. “With the plan from this summit and continuous reduced deforestation, this is where the international community should put its climate money,” he said. ___ Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

2023-12-21,Brazil Sues Meatpacker For Millions in Damages,289,"Rondônia State officials say JBS, the world's biggest meat producer, is buying cattle raised in an illegally deforested Amazon reserve. The Brazilian authorities are seeking millions of dollars in damages and fines from the world's biggest meatpacker, JBS, and three smaller slaughterhouses, according to court filings that accuse them of buying cattle raised on illegally deforested lands in the Amazon rainforest.   The lawsuits come as JBS is pursuing a listing on the New York Stock Exchange, which would give the company expanded access to capital. They are expected to increase pressure on the company, which was recently the subject of a Senate hearing because of its supply chain's links to deforestation. The United States is JBS's largest market.  The 17 suits, brought by Rondônia State, in the country's west, say that the companies have bought cattle raised in one of the Amazon's most devastated protected areas, the Jaci-Paraná Extractive Reserve, which has lost 77 percent of its forest cover since it was created in 1996. Dozens of members of the traditional communities there have left in fear of the land-grabbers and ranchers who have taken over most of the reserve.  JBS is the biggest purchaser of cattle from the Amazon rainforest, and experts say ranching is the biggest driver of deforestation there. Forest destruction, coupled with climate change, is already transforming humid ecosystems that store huge amounts of planet-warming gases into drier zones that instead release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. The result is a double blow against efforts to combat climate change and biodiversity loss.  A Times investigation in 2021 found that leather from cattle raised in Jaci-Paraná had ended up on the seats of pickup trucks, S.U.V.s and other vehicles sold by some of the world's largest automakers. JBS was a key supplier of the leather. At the time, it disputed allegations that it had bought cattle raised on illegally deforested lands.  In a statement on Wednesday, JBS said that it runs a robust monitoring system in Brazil that covers an area three times the size of Britain to guarantee its suppliers do not occupy any areas illegally. ''JBS is committed to a sustainable beef supply chain,'' the company said.  Three of the 17 lawsuits, which were first reported by The Associated Press and Agência Pública, are against JBS and a group of farmers who are accused of selling the company cattle raised on farms in the reserve. The other suits are against three smaller meatpackers that are accused of buying hundreds of cattle raised in the reserve.  The Rondônia State authorities say farmers sold 227 cattle raised on about 1,000 acres of illegally deforested land to JBS between 2019 and 2021. The state is seeking almost $3.5 million in damages from the company and the farmers. It is also imposing fines of more than $400,000 on JBS, though those could be challenged in court. Attorneys for the state did not reply to a request for comment.  JBS has made some progress in compliance in recent years, after federal prosecutors in Pará State filed lawsuits seeking environmental damages from a group of meatpackers in 2009. Prosecutors did not win the case but went on to establish a program that audits cattle purchases.  An audit of JBS's cattle purchases in Pará found that 6 percent had come from so-called irregular ranches, a steep drop from 2020, when an audit found that 32 percent of animals had come from irregular sources. The same audit in Rondônia this year found that 12 percent of cattle purchases by JBS did not comply with the law.  Under the administration of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, deforestation rates in the Brazilian part of the rainforest have fallen to a five-year low over the past 12 months.  ''There are signs things are improving,'' said Paulo Barreto, a researcher who focuses on cattle ranching at Imazon, a nonprofit research organization based in Belém, Brazil. But, he added, change was not coming fast enough.  Governments come and go, he said, so ''this stronger commitment from companies is very important to signal to politicians that things won't go back to the way they were before.''  Lawsuits that seek to hold meatpackers responsible for deforestation are rare, Mr. Barreto said. That's partly because purchases of cattle raised in illegally deforested lands are often hard to trace; they go through middlemen who present documents falsely attesting that the animals came from legal farms, the 2021 Times investigation found.  Daniel Azeredo, a federal prosecutor who has been investigating cattle ranching for more than a decade, said the Rondônia lawsuits ''strengthen the need for the country to improve traceability.'' Without that, he added, ''we will keep having the same problems.''  A judge in Rondônia, Pedro Sillas Carvalho, signaled doubts about the lawsuits brought by the state, according to one filing from last week. He wrote that the state attorneys needed to factor in the economic effects of their actions, because the exit of illegal farmers from the reserve could cause ''loss of revenue.'' The Times was unable to reach Judge Sillas Carvalho for comment. https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/20/climate/amazon-deforestation-jbs.html Graphic   PHOTO: The suits say that the companies have bought cattle raised in one of the Amazon's most devastated protected areas.

2023-07-25,"JPMorgan, Citi under fire for funding fossil fuels in the Amazon",290,"As the Amazon may face a catastrophic tipping point that’s eroding its status as a major carbon sink, a new study maps out which banks have pumped the most money into oil and gas extraction from the world’s largest rainforest. An analysis by Stand.earth, a nonprofit with offices in Canada and the US, lists JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. as the two banks that have dominated financial backing to fossil fuels in the Amazon basin over the past 15 years. In all, JPMorgan and Citigroup were behind $3.8 billion in loans and bonds for oil and gas production and infrastructure, according to Stand.earth. Since 2009, a total of 160 banks have channeled $20 billion in direct funding to oil and gas in the Amazon, the analysis found. Those activities have contributed to pollution and deforestation which, along with drought and fires, have pushed the Amazon close to passing a “tipping point” that may turn rainforests into grasslands within a few decades, according to climate scientists.  “Banks have a critical role to play in shifting the energy economics behind the climate crisis,” said Angeline Robertson, lead researcher at Stand.earth. “We continue to see financing for the expansion of oil and gas in the world’s biggest rainforest.” A spokesperson for Citigroup said the bank “continues to strengthen” its environmental and social risk management policy to protect sensitive areas like the Amazon. JPMorgan declined to comment. In 2021, scientists found that parts of the Amazon had begun to emit more CO2 than they absorb, turning them from a carbon sink to a source. That means the Amazon may start contributing more greenhouse gases to the environment than it removes, exacerbating the climate crisis.  The fallout from global overheating is becoming increasingly obvious, as temperatures soar to deadly highs across much of the globe, breaking previous records and demonstrating that the planet has already lurched into a new era of weather extremes. Actions that contribute to rising emissions will make it harder to avoid a climate catastrophe. Recognizing what’s at stake, some banks have pledged to stop backing fossil fuels in the Amazon. In May 2022, BNP Paribas SA said it “will no longer finance any oil and gas projects and related infrastructure” in the area.  HSBC Holdings Plc, which has provided $1.3 billion in direct finance to oil and gas in the Amazon over the past decade and a half, said in December that it would halt such activities. And other banks have committed to end trade finance for some Amazon oil. These moves send “important signals” that other banks too should “review their relationship to Amazon destruction” and take steps to manage that risk, Stand.earth said. Fany Kuiru, coordinator of indigenous organizations of the Amazon basin, described oil expansion in the area as “a latent threat” to people and ecosystems, adding that it drives degradation and deforestation and leads to chronic disease and contamination of food and water sources. “We urge the largest bank investors to leave the Amazon immediately,” Kuiru said. The Stand.earth analysis, which is based on Bloomberg data, also listed Bank of America Corp., Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Banco Santander SA, Itaú Unibanco Holding SA and Banco Bradesco SA as prominent financiers of oil and gas in the Amazon over the years. A Santander spokesperson said the bank is “fully committed to supporting the transition to net zero” and has set 2030 emissions reduction targets across a range of sectors in its loan book, including oil and gas. An HSBC spokesperson pointed Bloomberg to the bank’s updated energy policy, adding HSBC “will no longer provide new finance or advisory services for new oil and gas fields, or any O&G fields and related infrastructure in environmentally and socially critical areas such as the Amazon Biome.” A spokesperson for Itaú Unibanco said the bank has been working to reduce deforestation in the Amazon region by monitoring environmental, social and climate risks, and also by “defining decarbonization targets” for carbon-intensive sectors, including oil and gas. Goldman Sachs and Bank of America declined to comment. Bradesco hasn’t responded to a request for comment. Brazil President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva plans to host a meeting of government leaders next month in the city of Belem to renew the Amazon Cooperation Treaty Organization. Talks are expected to focus on how to better protect the forest and indigenous people and attract greener investment."
2023-07-28,Brazil's Indigenous chief fighting to save Amazon urges President Lula to defend people's rights,291,"BRASILIA, Brazil — The Amazon's most famous Indigenous leader called upon Brazil's president on Friday to defend the rights of Indigenous people. Chief Raoni Metuktire demanded that “invaders” be removed from their territories and that the government stop negotiations on carbon credits that had excluded Indigenous people from the discussions. In a letter to President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, Raoni demanded a government response to 11 specific requests by Aug. 9, the second and final day of the Amazon summit that Lula and other South American heads of state will attend in the city of Belem. The manifest was handed over to the minister of the Indigenous peoples, Sonia Guajajara, at an event attended by 1,000 members of different ethnic groups in the town of Sao Jose do Xingu in the state of Mato Grosso. Lula in May signed legislation paving the way for a market to trade carbon credits — generated by reducing greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change, and which may be purchased to comply with eventual limits on emissions. Lula's administration is reportedly drafting regulation for the carbon market's operation and plans to present it in the coming months. But Raoni said in his letter that Indigenous people have not been included in the process, and that their participation is required for the drafting of just legislation that takes their rights into consideration. Raoni, now in his 90s, also demanded the government take a “concrete position” on an upcoming court ruling that threatens to strip some Indigenous territories of their designations. The Supreme Court is in the process of evaluating whether Indigenous peoples must have been physically occupying their territories before 1988 in order to uphold their land claims. For years, Raoni has campaigned for the protection of Indigenous territories in the Amazon. A 1978 documentary, ""Raoni: The Fight for the Amazon,” contributed to his fame, as did a 1989 tour with British musician Sting. The letter also demanded a halt to mining activities that have triggered a health crisis among the Yanomami people during the previous government of far-right President Jair Bolsonaro as illegal gold miners swarmed into their territory. Lula’s government has spent months expelling most of them from Yanomami lands. Some remain, however, working at night to avoid being caught, Rodrigo Agostinho, the head of environmental agency Ibama, said earlier this month. Raoni's letter also demanded mass testing of Indigenous people for exposure to mercury — widely used by gold prospectors to separate the metal — and medical treatment for those affected. It also condemned so-called “agricultural partnerships” set up under Bolsonaro that forced Indigenous people to work in farming, saying they are “unconstitutional and go against the model of cultural sustainability.” Friday's event in Sao Jose do Xingu also showcased a letter from Britain's King Charles expressing support for Raoni and noting a common desire to see the Amazon protected. As a way of safeguarding their land, Brazil's Indigenous people have pushed for establishment of more Indigenous territories, a slow process that can take years. Brazil has so far established 732 Indigenous territories, occupying more than 117 million hectares (453,000 square miles) — or nearly 14% of the country's vast expanse, according to data from the Instituto Socioambiental. Of 14 territories that the government said would be created, only six have been established so far under Lula's latest, third term in office that started in January. However, deforestation in the Amazon rainforest has dropped 33.6% in his first six months from the same period of 2022, an encouraging sign for his administration’s environmental efforts. Lula campaigned last year with pledges to rein in illegal logging and undo the environmental devastation under Bolsonaro. Raoni walked alongside Lula up the presidential palace's ramp before his inaugural address on Jan. 1."
2023-06-27,"Despite Global Pledges, Tree Loss Is Up Sharply in Tropical Forests",292,"The pace of deforestation increased 10 percent in 2022, but there are signs the trajectory may change for the better in the near future. More than a year after countries pledged to end deforestation by 2030, the world is continuing to lose its tropical forests at a fast pace, according to a report issued on Tuesday. The annual survey by the World Resources Institute, a research organization, found that the world lost 10.2 million acres of primary rainforest in 2022, a 10 percent increase from the year before. It is the first assessment to cover a full year since November 2021, when 145 countries pledged at a global climate summit in Glasgow to halt forest loss by the end of this decade. “We had hoped by now to see a signal in the data that we were turning the corner on forest loss,” Frances Seymour, a senior fellow at the institute’s forest program, said. “We don’t see that signal yet, and in fact we’re headed in the wrong direction.” The report, done in collaboration with the University of Maryland, documented tree loss in the tropics from deforestation, fires and other causes. Last year’s destruction resulted in 2.7 gigatons of carbon dioxide emissions, a significant amount that is roughly equivalent to the annual fossil fuel emissions of India, a country of 1.4 billion. Tropical deforestation also degrades some of the planet’s richest ecosystems, the habitats for plants and animals and the regulators of rain patterns for several countries. The Amazon rainforest, the largest in the world, hasn’t faced such enormous destruction in almost two decades, according to an analysis of the World Resources Institute data by Amazon Conservation, a research organization. Brazil, the country with the largest portion of tropical rainforest, had the highest rates of deforestation globally. It accounted for more than 40 percent of tree loss globally, followed by the Democratic Republic of Congo and Bolivia. Bolivia delivered some of the report’s most striking numbers. Forest loss there went up 32 percent last year, the highest rate on record for that country. It was one of the few tropical forest countries that did not sign the Glasgow commitment on deforestation. Marlene Quintanilla, a research director at the Fundación Amigos de la Naturaleza, a nonprofit group in Bolivia, said a powerful driver of destruction in that country has been a government policy that encourages farmers to clear vast tracts to secure land titles. “The standing forest isn’t seen as fulfilling any social or economic function,” she said. The expansion of agriculture appeared to be hurting forests in Africa. In Ghana, the country that lost the biggest proportion of its primary forest last year, small-scale clearing for cocoa production was a major source of deforestation. Forest clearing is strongly linked to a lack of economic opportunities and basic infrastructure in the Congo River Basin region. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, for example, most people don’t have access to electricity, so the forest is an important source of firewood and charcoal for cooking. Teodyl Nkuintchua, who works on strategy and outreach for the World Resources Institute in the Congo Basin area, said policies to curb environmental harm would not work by themselves. “Unless we integrate development priorities in those actions in those countries, we will not be able to address deforestation,” he said. One of the few bright spots in the report came from Southeast Asia, where efforts to curb deforestation in Malaysia and Indonesia continued to yield results. A logging moratorium, efforts to restore peatlands, and corporate commitments to exclude palm oil suppliers linked to deforestation appear to be effective. And there are signs the trajectory of global deforestation may change for the better in the near future. The European Union this year delivered a push in that direction, adopting a law that bans the import of a series of products that contribute to deforestation in tropical countries. China, the world’s largest importer of many agricultural commodities, has recently committed to cracking down on illegal deforestation linked to its trade with Brazil. Brazil also seems to be changing course. President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva took office in January vowing to protect the Amazon rainforest, and preliminary numbers for the first five months of the year suggest deforestation rates there have declined by 31 percent since January. Deforestation and environmental crime had increased sharply under his predecessor, Jair Bolsonaro. The report’s analysis focuses on the tropics because forest loss there is usually more permanent and tends to be caused by human activity. Tropical forests also have a greater role in storing carbon and supporting biodiversity. But global tree cover loss beyond the tropics was down 10 percent last year. According to the report, the decline was a direct result of fewer wildfires in the boreal forests of Russia. But this could change. Canada is on track to have its worst fire season on record. El Niño, a climate pattern that is usually associated with more wildfires in the tropics, has also just arrived. There is concern that, even if countries are able to curb deforestation during this period, wildfires could erase some of their efforts. “An El Niño year will be a test,” Rod Taylor, the global director for forests at the World Resources Institute, said, adding that he hoped fires would not wreak havoc. “But we’ll have to see.” This article appeared in print on page A5."

2024-03-13,Brazil’s Clashing Goals: Protect the Amazon and Pump Lots More Oil,294,"State-owned Petrobras could soon be the world’s third-biggest oil producer, in stark contrast to the country’s promises to fight climate change and slow Amazon destruction. Through his office window, the head of Brazil’s state-run oil company looked out at the cluttered landscape of Rio de Janeiro. Looking back at him, across the city’s run-down high-rises, was the looming statue of Christ the Redeemer. Hawks circled an overflowing trash heap. Plumes of smoke rose from a blaze in a hillside shantytown. His company, Petrobras, is planning such a rapid increase in oil production that it could become the world’s third-largest producer by 2030, a transformation he believes could play a role in lessening the poverty dotting his vista. This, even as his country positions itself as a leader in the fight against climate change which, of course, is primarily driven by the burning of oil and other fossil fuels. Petrobras already pumps about as much crude oil per year as ExxonMobil, according to Rystad Energy, a market research firm. Over the next few years, it is projected to hurtle past the national oil companies of China, Russia and Kuwait, leaving only Saudi Arabia’s and Iran’s pumping more than Petrobras by 2030. It’s an enormous predicament for Brazil’s president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, better known simply as Lula, who has fashioned himself as the pre-eminent world leader on climate issues. By all accounts, Mr. Lula has come around in recent years to believing climate change is a major driver of poverty and inequality, which he has spent his decades-long political career vowing to eradicate. Since being elected in 2022, Mr. Lula has drastically reduced deforestation in the Amazon and overseen a sizable build-out of renewable energy. But he will also preside over Petrobras’ oil boom and a period of growing gas imports, both of which will facilitate Brazil growing hunger for cheap flights, meatier diets and air-conditioned homes. However contradictory that might seem, it’s only fair, said Jean Paul Prates, the Petrobras chief executive, perched up high in his company’s gleaming headquarters. “We will not give up that prerogative,” he said, “because others are not doing their own sacrifice as well.” It’s an argument that bedevils global efforts to reduce reliance on fossil fuels. Industrialized countries like the United States, which became economic superpowers by emitting huge amounts of greenhouse gases, are still the world’s biggest per capita producers and consumers of fossil fuels. And if they won’t stop, why should Brazil? Mr. Lula’s lead adviser on climate change, Ana Toni, a longtime director of various nonprofit groups, said that, ideally, Petrobras would be scaling back on oil and investing more heavily in renewables, essentially transforming itself into a new kind of company. But she echoed Mr. Prates and said that until the whole world moved together, with the richest leading the way, developing countries would balk at making their own sacrifices. Like many in Brazil, Ms. Toni pointed to the cautionary example of neighboring Colombia, whose president embarked on an ambitious plan, the first for any oil-producing country, to phase out its production of the fossil fuel. “Colombia’s brave decision is being taken by the market as creating economic insecurity. It’s really the worst-case scenario,” she said. “I wish countries richer than ours would have a real conversation about taking such steps, and not leave it to us vulnerable ones.” That tension has dominated years of climate negotiations and will once again be front and center at this year’s United Nations-sponsored summit being held in November in Azerbaijan. There, negotiators from nearly all the world’s nations are hoping to tackle the thorny issue of how richer countries can channel more money toward poorer ones to help them both adopt cleaner energy sources as well as adapt to climate change’s effects. After Azerbaijan, the next host of the U.N. climate summit will be Brazil itself. The summit will be in Belém, a city at the edge of the Amazon, near a place where Petrobras had proposed exploring for oil. But in one of the few instances of Brazil’s government curtailing the oil industry, the idea was blocked. Mr. Prates said Petrobras was appealing the decision. Meanwhile, Petrobras plans to spend north of $7 billion over the next five years on exploration of potential offshore drilling sites along other stretches of Brazil’s coast to augment its already growing production. Petrobras, like many other oil and gas companies, internally projects that demand for its products will remain stubbornly high. Accordingly, the company operates on a starkly different set of assumptions than those envisioned by the International Energy Agency and others who say demand for oil has either already peaked or is close to doing so. That leaves countries like Brazil in a kind of do-everything gray area, said Mercedes Bustamante, a professor and ecologist at the University of Brasília, and a member of the Climate Crisis Advisory Group, an independent group of scientists. Brazil is growing both renewables and fossil fuels. This year it joined OPEC, the global oil cartel, as an observer, even as next year it plans to host the U.N.’s global climate negotiations. By 2030 it will be the world’s fifth-biggest oil producer, according to Rystad’s data. This dynamic is reflected, too, in forests, Ms. Bustamante said. Land clearing in the Amazon has been curtailed, but it is simultaneously rising in the Cerrado, a vast savanna that covers much of central Brazil. “Having it both ways is very much part of Brazil’s policy DNA,” said Oliver Stuenkel, professor at the School of International Relations at Fundação Getulio Vargas in São Paulo. “We will be a green superpower, yes, but we’re not going to take unnecessary risks. That means preparing for a world in which oil will play an important role for a long time and the transition takes longer than expected.” Mr. Prates said he spoke with Mr. Lula every two weeks and was pushing him to understand that a transition away from fossil fuels needs to be “wisely slow.” “That means not slow because we don’t want to do transition, but slow because we need to correspond to expectations of the market for oil, gas and its derivatives,” he said. “Petrobras will go up to the end of the last drop of oil, just as Saudi Arabia or the Emirates will do the same.” Petrobras has some serious advantages in the long run, even if oil demand is peaking. Oil from Brazil’s offshore sites near Rio and São Paulo costs roughly $35 per barrel to produce, well below the international benchmark of $90. That is partly because it is less energy intensive to produce, which makes it marginally cleaner and more desirable for some emissions-conscious buyers. Mr. Lula’s government also faces a polarized electorate that generally, according to recent surveys, doesn’t consider climate change a voting issue. “Half the population doesn’t have access to treated sewage,” Mr. Stuenkel said. “Brazil has a very different set of public demands than richer countries. There’s a very long way to go in convincing Brazilian voters that there needs to be a painful reorganization of society to stave off climate change.” Nevertheless, Mr. Lula does deeply care, said Ms. Toni, his climate adviser. The world is relying on Brazil for leadership on this issue, and it has made ambitious pledges to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions. Those pledges are more ambitious, she made sure to note, than those of the United States or many other countries that have higher standards of living than Brazil. It as a good sign, she thinks, that Brazil is under pressure to rethink its oil expansion. To her, it means they’ve been so successful on the deforestation front that people are holding them to a higher standard. But that’s all for naught if the biggest players don’t mirror that ambition. “Even if Brazil stops producing oil tomorrow,” she said. “the U.S., Russia and others will not stop.” PHOTOS: Jean Paul Prates, the chief executive of Petrobras, Brazil’s state-run oil company.

2023-12-19,"Brazil lawsuits allege direct relationship between meatpackers, deforesters on protected land",295,"JACI-PARANA, Brazil — Meat processing giant JBS SA and three other slaughterhouses are facing lawsuits seeking millions of dollars in environmental damages for allegedly purchasing cattle raised illegally in a protected area in the Brazilian Amazon. The lawsuits, filed December 5 to 12 by the western Brazilian state of Rondonia, target the exploitation of a protected area known as Jaci-Parana, once rainforest but now mostly transformed into grassland by decades of misuse by land-grabbers, loggers and cattle ranchers. Despite a law forbidding commercial cattle in the reserve, some 216,000 head now graze on pasture there, according to the state animal division. The lawsuits contain a type of evidence that is getting the attention of deforestation experts and veterans of Brazil's illegal cattle trade: transfer documents showing cows going straight to the slaughterhouse from protected areas, with the information apparently provided by the illegal ranchers themselves. “In two decades fighting illegal cattle-raising in the Amazon, I had never encountered a transit permit with the name of a conservation unit on it,” said Jair Schmitt, chief of environmental protection at Brazil’s federal environmental agency, Ibama. ___ This article was produced as part of a collaboration between Brazilian news organization Agencia Publica and The Associated Press. ___ Of the 17 lawsuits, three name JBS, along with farmers, who allegedly sold 227 cattle raised in Jaci-Parana. The suits seek some $3.4 million for “invading, occupying, exploiting, causing environmental damage, preventing natural regeneration, and/or taking economic advantage” of the protected lands. JBS declined to answer questions from The Associated Press, saying it “has not been summoned by the court, which makes it impossible to conduct any analysis yet.” Three smaller meatpacking companies are also accused of causing environmental harm by buying cattle from the reserve. Frigon, Distriboi and Tangara did not respond to questions. Frigon has ties to influential people in Rondonia politics and is accused of buying the largest number of cattle — almost 1,400 head from eight illicit ranches. The state's attorney is seeking $17.2 million from Frigon and those farmers. Both Frigon and the two JBS plants allegedly involved have exported meat to the U.S., as well as to China, the largest buyer of Brazilian beef, Hong Kong, Russia, Egypt, Morocco, Spain, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and others, according to data from Panjiva, a company that uses customs records to track international trade. The lawsuits aim to put a price on the destruction of old-growth rainforest, a difficult task given that it is virtually irreplaceable except over decades. A court filing pegs damages in the reserve at some $1 billion. It is unclear whether the hundreds of other invaders in Jaci-Parana will also be sued for compensation. “The invaders and their main business partners – loggers and meatpacking companies – make the profits their own while passing on to society the costs of environmental damage,” the lawsuits say. In one indication of the potential seriousness of the new lawsuits, a court officer trying to serve an eviction notice to one of the illegal farmers in the reserve said he was threatened with death. Deforestation is a major concern in the Amazon rainforest, where many seek to profit from its vast resources through mining, timber harvesting, agriculture and more. Besides harming a critical biosphere, the development pressure also threatens a critical carbon sink for a planet that's warming dangerously from climate change. Two-thirds of Amazon deforestation results from conversion to pasture, according to the government. Rondonia, on the border with Bolivia, is the most badly deforested state in the Brazilian Amazon. The creation of Jaci-Parana Reserve and other state conservation areas was funded by the World Bank in the 1990s as a kind of atonement, the bank says. Years before, it had financed the construction of highway BR-364, a road that brought thousands of settlers into the forest from southern Brazil. In five decades, about 40% of it was gone, according to Mapbiomas, a Brazilian consortium of nonprofits, universities and technology startups. Other conservation units were also invaded by land-grabbers, with little objection from authorities. Some Brazilian administrations even encouraged it. In 2010, President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, in his second term, reduced the Bom Futuro National Forest, adjacent to Jaci-Parana, by two-thirds. Land grabbers eventually gained title to what was supposed to be protected forest. In 2019, far-right Jair Bolsonaro was elected president, as was his ally Marcos Rocha as governor of Rondonia, on campaigns promising to legalize illegal land holders. Land-grabbers plowed onto conservation lands. With the political promises, 778 land invaders were induced to come forward and register the property they were occupying as well as their cattle for health inspection.  “It reveals the contradiction between public agencies, with the animal health agency validating cattle that are illegally raised,” said Paulo Barreto, a senior researcher with Imazon, a non-profit that monitors cattle in the region. “It also reveals the fragility of JBS' control system.” The potential money to be made was irresistible. Privatization of Jaci-Parana would have meant adding swaths of public land to the real estate market. The 151,000 hectares (583 square miles) converted to grassland would be worth around $453 million, according to geographer Amanda Michalski, a researcher at Rondonia Federal University. And the new owners would have gotten that land for free. In its statement, JBS declined to comment on its operations in Rondonia but said in the Amazon as a whole, 94% of purchases are of legal cattle, quoting an audit published in October by Brazil´s Federal Prosecution Service, which regularly scrutinizes cattle sales to counter deforestation caused by the meat trade. Yet the same audit found that 12% of cattle purchased by JBS in Rondonia came from illegally deforested areas. And those audits only examine direct purchases. They don't track the vast trade in cattle laundering in Brazil, transferring cows from an illegal area to a legal farm before selling to slaughterhouses, deliberately muddying traceability. In November, a report by Imazon called JBS the company most likely to purchase cattle from illegally deforested areas based on a variety of factors, including where slaughterhouses are located and their buying areas. “Companies must boycott cattle areas at high risk for illegal activity and lack of enforcement,” Barreto, co-author of the study, said. “By purchasing cattle from these areas, companies endorse predatory and illegal behavior and strengthen the political power of these actors.” Last July, AP journalists visited Jaci-Parana and saw on the ground what satellite imagery detected from space: the only forested areas left were along two rivers. With almost 80% destroyed, it's the most ravaged conservation unit in the Brazilian Amazon. Jaci-Parana is designated an extractive reserve, a type of protection in which forest communities are allowed to live their traditional ways without logging, protected from land-grabbing and cattle-ranching. But the opposite happened. Dozens of families who once made their living by tapping rubber trees inside the reserve and harvesting Brazil nuts have been expelled by force. The few remaining live along the riverbanks — most afraid to be interviewed for fear of being attacked. Lincoln Fernandes de Lima, 45, whose family has lived in the area for three generations, described land-grabbers who ""remove all the timber and Brazil nuts trees. They get to the water source, already having cut down the trees around it, and keep cutting, cutting,” he said in an interview in July. ""When the residents leave their houses to do something in the forest, they shoot up the pots and pans. And many, many times the houses are cut down with a chainsaw.” In September, two men carrying guns paid a visit to de Lima, claiming their boss had acquired the area. They gave him 24 hours to leave. He took it as a death threat and complied — the third time he had been forced out of the reserve. Five days later, his neighbor, rubber tapper Efigenio Mota da Silva, had his home burned down. They fled to Jaci-Parana village, where scores of families of expelled subsistence gatherers have sought shelter. The village has also been the home of Rosa Maria Lopes. She was born 1952 in a rubber grove inside the reserve. Her family lived in the same area for over a century, but was also driven out by cattle farmers. Where she grew up is now pasture. “There’s nothing left there,” she told the AP on the porch of her daughter's home. ""No one talks about Brazil nuts, copaiba oil trees or rubber anymore. There’s no talk about corn, pumpkin, or whatever is served on the table. It’s only cattle, farms, and pasture. Are we only going to eat grass?” ___ Valente reports for Agencia Publica.

2024-03-14,Protect Amazon or Pump More Oil? Brazil Aims to Do Both.,296,"State-owned Petrobras could soon be the world's third-biggest oil producer, in stark contrast to the country's promises to fight climate change and slow Amazon destruction. Through his office window, the head of Brazil's state-run oil company looked out at the cluttered landscape of Rio de Janeiro. Looking back at him, across the city's run-down high-rises, was the looming statue of Christ the Redeemer. Hawks circled an overflowing trash heap. Plumes of smoke rose from a blaze in a hillside shantytown.   His company, Petrobras, is planning such a rapid increase in oil production that it could become the world's third-largest producer by 2030, a transformation he believes could play a role in lessening the poverty dotting his vista. This, even as his country positions itself as a leader in the fight against climate change which, of course, is primarily driven by the burning of oil and other fossil fuels.  Petrobras already pumps about as much crude oil per year as ExxonMobil, according to Rystad Energy, a market research firm. Over the next few years, it is projected to hurtle past the national oil companies of China, Russia and Kuwait, leaving only Saudi Arabia's and Iran's pumping more than Petrobras by 2030.  It's an enormous predicament for Brazil's president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, better known simply as Lula, who has fashioned himself as the pre-eminent world leader on climate issues. By all accounts, Mr. Lula has come around in recent years to believing climate change is a major driver of poverty and inequality, which he has spent his decades-long political career vowing to eradicate.  Since being elected in 2022, Mr. Lula has drastically reduced deforestation in the Amazon and overseen a sizable build-out of renewable energy. But he will also preside over Petrobras' oil boom and a period of growing gas imports, both of which will facilitate Brazil growing hunger for cheap flights, meatier diets and air-conditioned homes.  However contradictory that might seem, it's only fair, said Jean Paul Prates, the Petrobras chief executive, perched up high in his company's gleaming headquarters.  ''We will not give up that prerogative,'' he said, ''because others are not doing their own sacrifice as well.''  It's an argument that bedevils global efforts to reduce reliance on fossil fuels. Industrialized countries like the United States, which became economic superpowers by emitting huge amounts of greenhouse gases, are still the world's biggest per capita producers and consumers of fossil fuels.  And if they won't stop, why should Brazil?  Mr. Lula's lead adviser on climate change, Ana Toni, a longtime director of various nonprofit groups, said that, ideally, Petrobras would be scaling back on oil and investing more heavily in renewables, essentially transforming itself into a new kind of company. But she echoed Mr. Prates and said that until the whole world moved together, with the richest leading the way, developing countries would balk at making their own sacrifices.  Like many in Brazil, Ms. Toni pointed to the cautionary example of neighboring Colombia, whose president embarked on an ambitious plan, the first for any oil-producing country, to phase out its production of the fossil fuel.  ''Colombia's brave decision is being taken by the market as creating economic insecurity. It's really the worst-case scenario,'' she said. ''I wish countries richer than ours would have a real conversation about taking such steps, and not leave it to us vulnerable ones.''  That tension has dominated years of climate negotiations and will once again be front and center at this year's United Nations-sponsored summit being held in November in Azerbaijan. There, negotiators from nearly all the world's nations are hoping to tackle the thorny issue of how richer countries can channel more money toward poorer ones to help them both adopt cleaner energy sources as well as adapt to climate change's effects.  After Azerbaijan, the next host of the U.N. climate summit will be Brazil itself. The summit will be in Belém, a city at the edge of the Amazon, near a place where Petrobras had proposed exploring for oil. But in one of the few instances of Brazil's government curtailing the oil industry, the idea was blocked. Mr. Prates said Petrobras was appealing the decision.  Meanwhile, Petrobras plans to spend north of $7 billion over the next five years on exploration of potential offshore drilling sites along other stretches of Brazil's coast to augment its already growing production.  Petrobras, like many other oil and gas companies, internally projects that demand for its products will remain stubbornly high. Accordingly, the company operates on a starkly different set of assumptions than those envisioned by the International Energy Agency and others who say demand for oil has either already peaked or is close to doing so.  That leaves countries like Brazil in a kind of do-everything gray area, said Mercedes Bustamante, a professor and ecologist at the University of Brasília, and a member of the Climate Crisis Advisory Group, an independent group of scientists.  Brazil is growing both renewables and fossil fuels. This year it joined OPEC, the global oil cartel, as an observer, even as next year it plans to host the U.N.'s global climate negotiations. By 2030 it will be the world's fifth-biggest oil producer, according to Rystad's data.  This dynamic is reflected, too, in forests, Ms. Bustamante said. Land clearing in the Amazon has been curtailed, but it is simultaneously rising in the Cerrado, a vast savanna that covers much of central Brazil.  ''Having it both ways is very much part of Brazil's policy DNA,'' said Oliver Stuenkel, professor at the School of International Relations at Fundação Getulio Vargas in São Paulo. ''We will be a green superpower, yes, but we're not going to take unnecessary risks. That means preparing for a world in which oil will play an important role for a long time and the transition takes longer than expected.''  Mr. Prates said he spoke with Mr. Lula every two weeks and was pushing him to understand that a transition away from fossil fuels needs to be ''wisely slow.''  ''That means not slow because we don't want to do transition, but slow because we need to correspond to expectations of the market for oil, gas and its derivatives,'' he said. ''Petrobras will go up to the end of the last drop of oil, just as Saudi Arabia or the Emirates will do the same.''  Petrobras has some serious advantages in the long run, even if oil demand is peaking. Oil from Brazil's offshore sites near Rio and São Paulo costs roughly $35 per barrel to produce, well below the international benchmark of $90. That is partly because it is less energy intensive to produce, which makes it marginally cleaner and more desirable for some emissions-conscious buyers.  Mr. Lula's government also faces a polarized electorate that generally, according to recent surveys, doesn't consider climate change a voting issue. ''Half the population doesn't have access to treated sewage,'' Mr. Stuenkel said. ''Brazil has a very different set of public demands than richer countries. There's a very long way to go in convincing Brazilian voters that there needs to be a painful reorganization of society to stave off climate change.''  Nevertheless, Mr. Lula does deeply care, said Ms. Toni, his climate adviser.  The world is relying on Brazil for leadership on this issue, and it has made ambitious pledges to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions. Those pledges are more ambitious, she made sure to note, than those of the United States or many other countries that have higher standards of living than Brazil.  It as a good sign, she thinks, that Brazil is under pressure to rethink its oil expansion. To her, it means they've been so successful on the deforestation front that people are holding them to a higher standard.  But that's all for naught if the biggest players don't mirror that ambition. ''Even if Brazil stops producing oil tomorrow,'' she said. ''the U.S., Russia and others will not stop.''

2023-08-09,"Amazon nations seek common voice on climate change, urge developed world to help protect rainforest",297,"BELEM, Brazil — Leaders from South American nations that are home to the Amazon challenged developed countries on Tuesday to do more to stop massive destruction of the world’s largest rainforest, a task they said can’t fall to just a few when the crisis has been caused by so many. Assembling in the Brazilian city of Belem, the members of the Amazon Cooperation Treaty Organization, or ACTO, also sought to chart a common course on how to combat climate change, hoping a united front will give them a major voice in global talks. The calls from the presidents of nations including Brazil, Colombia and Bolivia came as leaders aim to fuel much-needed economic development in their regions while preventing the Amazon’s ongoing demise “from reaching a point of no return,” according to a joint declaration issued at the end of the day. Some scientists say that when 20% to 25% of the forest is destroyed, rainfall will dramatically decline, transforming more than half of the rainforest to tropical savannah, with immense biodiversity loss. “The forest unites us. It is time to look at the heart of our continent and consolidate, once and for all, our Amazon identity,” said Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. “In an international system that was not built by us, we were historically relegated to a subordinate place as a supplier of raw materials. A just ecological transition will allow us to change this.” The two-day summit ending Wednesday reinforces Lula’s strategy to leverage global concern for the Amazon’s preservation. Emboldened by a 42% drop in deforestation during his first seven months in office, he has sought international financial support for forest protection. The Amazon stretches across an area twice the size of India. Two-thirds of it lie in Brazil, with seven other countries and one territory share the remaining third. Governments have historically viewed it as an area to be colonized and exploited, with little regard for sustainability or the rights of its Indigenous peoples. All the countries at the summit have ratified the Paris climate accord, which requires signatories to set targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. But cross-border cooperation has historically been scant, undermined by low trust, ideological differences and the lack of government presence. Aside from a general consensus on the need for shared global responsibility, members of ACTO — convening for only the fourth time in the organization’s existence — demonstrated Tuesday they aren’t fully aligned on key issues. This week marks the first meeting of the 45-year-old organization in 14 years. Forest protection commitments have been uneven previously, and appeared to remain so at the summit. The “Belem Declaration,” the gathering’s official proclamation issued Tuesday, didn’t include shared commitments to zero deforestation by 2030. Brazil and Colombia have already made those commitments. Lula has said he hopes the document will be a shared call to arms at the COP 28 climate conference in November. A key topic dividing the nations on Tuesday was oil. Notably, leftist Colombian President Gustavo Petro called for an end to oil exploration in the Amazon — an allusion to the ambivalent approach of Brazil and other oil-producing nations in the region — and said that governments must forge a path toward “decarbonized prosperity.” “A jungle that extracts oil — is it possible to maintain a political line at that level? Bet on death and destroying life?” Petro said. He also spoke about finding ways to reforest pastures and plantations, which cover much of Brazil's heartland for cattle ranching and growing soy. Lula, who has presented himself as an environmental leader on the international stage, has refrained from taking a definitive stance on oil, citing the decision as a technical matter. Meanwhile, Brazil’s state-run Petrobras company has been seeking to explore for oil near the mouth of the Amazon River. Despite disagreements among nations, there have been encouraging signs of increased regional cooperation amid growing global recognition of the Amazon’s importance in arresting climate change. Sharing a united voice — along with funneling more money into ACTO — could help it serve as the region's representative on the global stage ahead of the COP climate conference, leaders said. “The Amazon is our passport to a new relationship with the world, a more symmetric relationship, in which our resources are not exploited to benefit few, but rather valued and put in the service of everyone,” Lula said. Bolivian President Luis Arce said the Amazon has been the victim of capitalism, reflected by runaway expansion of agricultural borders and natural resource exploitation. And he noted that industrialized nations are responsible for most historic greenhouse gas emissions. “The fact that the Amazon is such an important territory doesn’t imply that all of the responsibilities, consequences and effects of the climate crisis should fall to us, to our towns and to our economies,” Arce said. Petro argued that affluent nations should swap foreign debt owed by Amazon countries for climate action, saying that would create enough investment to power the Amazon region’s economy. Signed by officials from eight nations, the Belem Declaration also: — Condemns the proliferation of protectionist trade barriers, which signatories said negatively affects poor farmers in developing nations and hampers the promotion of Amazon products and sustainable development. — Calls on industrialized nations to comply with their obligations to provide massive financial support to developing nations. — Calls for the strengthening of law enforcement cooperation. Commits authorities to exchanging best practices and intelligence about specific illicit activities, including deforestation, human rights violations, trafficking of fauna and flora and the sale and smuggling of mercury, a highly toxic metal widely used for illegal gold mining that pollutes waterways. Colombia's Petro also called for the formation of a military alliance akin to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, saying such a group could be tasked not only with protecting the Amazon, but tackling another major problem for the region: organized crime. Few border areas are policed seriously and there has been scant international cooperation as rival organized crime groups compete for drug-trafficking routes. Drug seizures have increased in Colombia, Brazil, Bolivia and Peru over the past decade, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) reported in June. Lula previously announced a plan to create an international police center in Manaus. Also attending the summit Tuesday were Guyana’s prime minister, Venezuela’s vice president and the foreign ministers of Suriname and Ecuador. On Wednesday, the summit will welcome representatives of Norway and Germany, the largest contributors to Brazil’s Amazon Fund for sustainable development, along with counterparts from other crucial rainforest regions: Indonesia, Republic of Congo, and Democratic Republic of Congo.

2023-09-15,Brazil restores stricter climate goals,299,"RIO DE JANEIRO — Brazil is reinstating stronger greenhouse gas commitments it made in 2015 as part of the Paris Agreement that were weakened under former President Jair Bolsonaro. The announcement was made Thursday by the country's Committee on Climate Change, a joint body made up of 18 government ministries. “Brazil is a major actor in helping the planet in this challenging moment,"" Vice President Geraldo Alckmin said during the committee meeting in Brasilia. The change will be officially transmitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the international body that works to advance global action on climate change. It tracks each country's Nationally Determined Contribution or commitment to reducing national emissions in accordance with the Paris Agreement. During the tenure of far-right President Bolsonaro, Brazil backtracked on its Nationally Determined Contribution calculation twice. The most recent weakening occurred in 2021 and was estimated by the Climate Observatory, a network of numerous environmental and social groups, to increase Brazil’s target emissions by 73 million metric tons of CO2 by 2030. Brazil’s target under the Paris Agreement is 1.2 billion metric tons of CO2. Releasing its own analysis Friday, the Talanoa Institute, a climate policy-focused think tank, called the restoration merely an initial step, saying bolder commitments are needed. The Institute said the emissions target process should be opened to society as a whole in contrast to what it called the closed-door decision-making that has taken place up until now. This would enable Brazil to set more ambitious targets, not merely reinstate commitments from 2015, it argued. Brazil is the world’s fifth-largest emitter of greenhouse gases, contributing nearly 3% of global emissions, according to Climate Watch, an online platform managed by the World Resources Institute. Almost half of these emissions stem from destruction of trees in the Amazon rainforest, which reached a 15-year high during Bolsonaro’s presidency. The former president dismantled Brazil’s environmental agencies in favor of expanding agribusiness, neglecting preservation efforts. In a stark turnaround, President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has reduced deforestation by 48% for the period from January to August. ____ Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

2023-09-20,Biden and Brazil's Lula focus on workers' rights while publicly playing down differences,301,"NEW YORK — President Joe Biden and his Brazilian counterpart, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, played up their mutual affection for workers’ rights Wednesday as the leaders of the Western Hemisphere’s two largest democracies met in New York, steering clear in public about their differences on Ukraine and other matters. They announced a new partnership on supporting labor while avoiding openly discussing disagreements such as U.S. policy toward Cuba and Russia’s war in Ukraine, mere hours before Lula’s first-ever bilateral meeting with his Ukrainian counterpart. In remarks to reporters, Biden and Lula were eager to display their shared goals on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly. Biden sought to tie the meeting to domestic matters. Long a champion of labor unions, Biden is navigating strikes in the U.S. by autoworkers, screenwriters and actors who are seeking better pay and protections in a changing global economy. He has declined the request by the United Auto Workers leader to join the picket line. “When the middle does well, everybody does well,” Biden told Lula. “Working-class folks have a chance to move up. And the wealthy still do fine, as long as they pay their taxes.” Lula said he had never heard an American president speak so highly of workers and described their common cause as a chance to transform ties between the countries. “This meeting here, for me, is more than a bilateral meeting; it is the rebirth of a new era in the relationship between the U.S. and Brazil. It is a relationship of equals,” Lula said. He later described it as “a golden moment for us.” Initial hopes that Lula would prove a staunch ally for Biden have been tempered in recent months, with the Brazilian leader voicing opposition on some issues and at times even seeming to thumb his nose at Washington. That has included dismissing allegations of Venezuela's authoritarianism, calling for decreased dependence on the dollar for global trade and accusing the U.S. of fueling bloodshed in Ukraine by providing military aid — and refusing to supply munitions himself. In his speech at the U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday, Lula criticized the U.S. embargo and sanctions targeting Cuba. The White House issued a readout that showed Biden privately raised some of his policy disagreements with Lula. The U.S. president tried to make the case that Russia’s war in Ukraine has hurt poorer countries by pushing up food and energy prices, saying that Russia should return to its grain deal with Ukraine to help relieve those pressures. Biden also outlined the steps that he believes should be taken to aid democracy in Venezuela. The U.S. president had frosty relations with Lula's predecessor, Jair Bolsonaro, an open admirer of Donald Trump who waited weeks before recognizing Democrat Biden’s 2020 election victory over Republican Trump. After Bolsonaro's defeat, his supporters stormed Congress, the Supreme Court and presidential palace in Brasilia in an attempt to oust Lula from power. The circumstances bore a clear resemblance to Trump and the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol. Lula quickly traveled to Washington, where he and Biden reflected on the challenges to democracy they had both overcome. The goal of their new partnership on labor is to stop the exploitation of workers and forced and child labor, as well as workplace discrimination, and create a possible template for others in the Group of 20 to join. The two leaders also want to guarantee that the move away from fossil fuels to renewable energy emphasizes the rights of workers. Biden sees support from organized labor as an essential part of his 2024 reelection efforts, stressing that his policies will create factory and construction jobs that do not require a college degree. “Whether it’s the auto workers or any other union worker, record corporation profits should mean record contracts for union workers,” said Biden as he tried to link the announcement to the ongoing U.S. strikes. Lula got his start in politics as leader of a powerful metalworkers' union and, on Wednesday, highlighted that he spent more than two decades in factories and has no degree himself. “This gesture we are doing here is an awakening of hope for millions and millions of Brazilians and Amdericans who need to have the opportunity to live life, to triumph, to work and build their family decently,” Lula said. Also high on their Wednesday agenda was environmental preservation. Lula has presented himself as a leader on this front, and his administration has made significant progress in the Amazon. Deforestation of the Amazon had soared to a 15-year high under Bolsonaro, who called for the development of the rainforest, emboldening loggers and miners to invade protected areas, while defanging environmental authorities. Lula began rebuilding those agencies, created eight protected areas for Indigenous people, and expelled thousands of miners from the massive Yanomami Indigenous territory. Deforestation dropped by nearly half in his first eight months. He has sought international contributions for Brazil’s Amazon Fund, but donations have been small and symbolic. In February, the U.S. committed to a $50 million donation to the initiative, though it has yet to be provided. Biden later announced he would ask Congress for an additional $500 million, which has yet to be committed. “It is very important that the United States sees what is happening in Brazil at this historic moment of ecological transition, of changing the energy matrix, the potential our country has for investment,” Lula said. Later Wednesday, Lula and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy held their bilateral meeting. It was “icebreaking,” Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine's foreign minister, told reporters afterward. Lula has refused to join Washington and Western Europe in backing Ukraine’s fight against Russia’s invasion, and previously called for a club of nations to mediate peace talks. At one point this year, he said both nations had chosen to go to war, but he backtracked following backlash. “The conversation was very warm and honest, and I think both presidents now understand their positions much better than before,” Kuleba told reporters. Brazil's foreign minister Mauro Vieira echoed those sentiments, and said Lula told Zelenskyy that Brazil is willing to join a group of nations chosen by Ukraine and Russia to promote the possibility of peace. “There is in no way disagreement between the two heads of state,” Vieira said. ___ Boak reported from Washington."
2023-10-02,Brazil's government starts expelling non-Indigenous people from two native territories in the Amazon,302,"SAO PAULO — Brazil’s government on Monday began removing thousands of non-Indigenous people from two native territories in a move that will affect thousands who live in the heart of the Amazon rainforest. The South American nation’s intelligence agency ABIN said in a statement that the goal is to return the Apyterewa and Trincheira Bacaja lands in Para state to the original peoples. It did not say whether or not the expulsion of non-Indigenous people has been entirely peaceful. The territories are located around the municipalities of Sao Felix do Xingu, Altamira, Anapu and Senador Jose Porfirio in Para state. Brazil's government said the country’s Supreme Court and other judges had ordered the operation. Indigenous groups estimate more than 10,000 non-Indigenous people are living inside the two territories. ABIN said as many as 2,500 Indigenous people live in 51 villages within. “The presence of strangers on Indigenous land threatens the integrity of the Indigenous (people) and causes other damages, such as the destruction of forests,” the agency said in its statement. It added that about 1,600 families live illegally in that region with some involved in illegal activities such as cattle raising and gold mining. ""They also destroy native vegetation.” The Apyterewa territory had the most deforestation of any Indigenous land in Brazil for four years running, according to official data. Footage obtained by local media and shared on social media in September showed hundreds of non-Indigenous people living in a newly built town with restaurants, bars and churches deep inside the lands of the Parakana. Other authorities that participated in the action on Monday included Brazil's ministry of Indigenous Peoples, environment protection agency IBAMA, the federal police and armed forces, among many others. Several of those bodies were defanged and did little to protect Indigenous peoples’ territories during the far-right administration of former President Jair Bolsonaro between 2019 and 2022. Brazil’s President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva began rebuilding environment protection agencies and has so far created eight protected areas for Indigenous people. Soon after the beginning of his administration, his government expelled thousands of gold miners from the massive Yanomami Indigenous territory in the northern state of Roraima. State and federal authorities this year also dislodged landgrabbers from the Alto Rio Guama territory. They threatened forcible expulsion of those settlers failing to leave, and pledged to eliminate access roads and irregular installations; nearly all of the illegal residents departed voluntarily. Encroachment on such territories over recent years prompted Brazil’s top court on Thursday to enshrine Indigenous land rights by denying a suit backed by farmers that sought to block an Indigenous group from expanding the size of its territorial claim. In the case before the court, Santa Catarina state argued that the date Brazil’s Constitution was promulgated — Oct. 5, 1988 — should be the deadline for when Indigenous peoples to have already either physically occupied land or be legally fighting to reoccupy territory. Nine of 11 justices of Brazil’s Supreme Court ruled against that argument, a decision that has far-reaching implications for territories nationwide."
2023-08-08,CLIMATE GLIMPSE: Here's what you need to see and know today,303,"Amid misery, humans find a way to cope — as seen in this image of flooding following heavy monsoon rains in Kathmandu, Nepal. Associated Press photographer Niranjan Shrestha made this picture of a man putting his child on a plastic vessel to play on Tuesday in the spreading waters of the Bagmati River. Meanwhile, in South Korea on Tuesday, tens of thousands of Scouts were arriving at inland cities after a tropical storm prompted the government to evacuate the World Scout Jamboree. Tropical Storm Khanun's path toward the Korean Peninsula raised alarms about the scouts' coastal campsite in Saemangeum, where last week's high heat had already required treatment for more than 100 people at the event. The evacuation involved some 37,000 Scouts from 156 countries, shifting them to university dormitories, government and corporate training centers and hotels inland to continue cultural events and activities. Here’s what else is happening related to extreme weather and the climate right now: —The European climate monitoring organization made it official Tuesday: July 2023 was Earth's hottest month on record by a wide margin. Copernicus Climate Change Service said the global average of 16.95 degrees Celsius (62.51 Fahrenheit) was one-third of a degree Celsius higher than the previous record set in 2019. —Scientists said shattered temperature records and more frequent wacky weather events are being seen even in Antarctica, a place once seen as at least slightly shielded from global warming's wildness. —In Brazil, leaders of the nations that share the Amazon rainforest were meeting to discuss ways to protect the ecosystem from its many threats, including organized crime. The Amazon Cooperation Treaty Organization is a 45-year-old alliance without a history of effective action, but Brazil President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has said he hopes this time will be different. —About 1,400 people evacuated from villages and a campsite because of wildfires in Portugal were gradually returning home on Tuesday. More than 1,000 firefighters are battling the fires as Portugal and neighboring Spain endure extreme heat above 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit). —New Zealand, with a grid that already runs on about 82% renewable energy, announced a partnership with a U.S. investment giant to goose wind, solar, battery storage and green hydrogen to get to 100% by the end of the decade. —President Joe Biden visited Arizona on Tuesday to announce plans for a new national monument to preserve about 1,500 square miles just outside Grand Canyon National Park. Preserving the land has been a goal of tribes and environmentalists from decades. —Scientists have been warning about the danger of glacial flooding in an era of climate change, with some 15 million people thought to be at risk globally. It happened over the weekend in Juneau, Alaska. QUOTABLE: “They have to make this deforestation stop.

2023-06-12,EU Commission chief talks with Brazil's president about stalled trade deal,304,"BRASILIA, Brazil — European Comission President Ursula von der Leyen met with Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva on Monday in a bid to get a free trade deal moving again. The 27-member EU completed negotiations in 2019 on a wide-ranging trade deal with Mercosur — comprised of Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay — but it has yet to be ratified by any of the individual countries. Ratification stalled during the presidency of Lula’s predecessor, Jair Bolsonaro, due to the EU's concern over his environmental policies as well as a European desire to protect its local farmers from cheaper imports from Mercosur. Proposed modifications of the original agreement have yet to get the process back on track. In March, the EU sent a letter to Mercosur seeking to establish stricter environmental requirements for South American countries in order to persuade European nations to ratify the deal. “We are very much looking forward to your answer, because it is our opening to listen to you, to listen where we have to improve,” von der Leyen said in prepared remarks after her meeting with Lula. “So that we can, indeed, by the end of the year, conclude the Mercosur agreement.” But Brazil’s president openly expressed dismay with the proposal. “The premise that needs to exist among strategic partners is of mutual trust and not distrust and sanctions,” he said. The March letter doesn't explicitly mention sanctions, but rather proposes to make mandatory some of the environmental goals established by the Paris Agreement. Brazilian Foreign Minister Mauro Vieira has said that different interpretations of European law could mean failure to fulfill goals would result in sanctions. The EU-Mercosur trade agreement is meant to link two markets with a total population of around 800 million people and accounting for about a fourth of the world’s gross domestic product. It envisions leading to more than $100 billion in annual trade of goods and services by cutting customs duties and easing access for Mercosur agricultural exporters to the EU market and for European manufacturers to Mercosur countries. Since Lula became president in January, members of his administration have raised questions about the agreement, said Lucas Leite, a professor of international relations at the Armando Alvares Penteado Foundation, a university in Sao Paulo. He said their concerns include whether Brazil's industrialized goods will be able to compete with European competitors and the possibility the nation could be negatively affected. “The environmental standards are a challenge for the Brazilian government, which talks about the need to reindustrialize the country,"" Leite said. ""This agreement would not be good for Brazil. We are only able to compete in the agricultural sector.” Two officials within the foreign relations ministry told The Associated Press that many Brazilian diplomats are arguing that the EU's March proposal provides a good excuse to not ratify the agreement. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Amid the uncertainty over the deal, von der Leyen sought to show European solidarity with Brazil by announcing new spending programs. She said the EU will invest 2 billion euros ($2.2 billion) for hydrogen production, a green energy project aimed at lessening dependence on fossil fuels. She said the EU also will provide 430 million euros to help fight deforestation and 20 million euros to the Amazon Fund to preserve the Amazon Forest. “This is only the start,” von der Leyen said, adding that individual European nations and private donors are expected to complement the total. “Europe is back in Brazil, Europe is back in Latin America.” Von der Leyen met with executives from Brazil’s industrial sector after her session with Lula. Brasilia is the first stop on her Latin America tour. She will now travel to Argentina, Chile and Mexico, and meet with each nation's president. In July, EU members and the heads of state from the Community of Latin American and Carribean States are scheduled to hold a summit. ___ Associated Press writer Raf Casert in Brussels contributed to this report."
2023-08-24,"Support grows for sustainable development, a 'bioeconomy,' in the Amazon",305,"BELEM, Brazil — If all goes according to plan, in a few weeks people will be sipping a shake that Marcelo Salazar has been developing for three years, made from the Amazon jungle’s cornucopia. His company Mazo Mana Forest Food has partnered with communities that live from the forest and gather the Brazil nuts, cocoa beans, acai, mushrooms, fruits and other ingredients that go into the drinks. They have received some backing from a business incubator based in Manaus that focuses on sustainable forest businesses, to counter an economy based on logging and ranching. “To turn the game around, I think it takes a new generation of ventures that combine different business models,"" Salazar said. Some hope sustainable ventures like this will be part of a new “bioeconomy,” a buzzword at the Amazon Summit in Belem in early August, where policymakers voiced eagerness to protect the rainforest and provide a livelihood for tens of millions of rainforest residents. But beyond general support for the notion, there was little consensus about what exactly a bioeconomy should look like. Salazar attended and spoke on a panel organized by Brazil’s environment ministry titled “The challenge of building an Amazon bioeconomy.” The idea is not new. It is the latest term for sustainable livelihood, or sustainable development or the green economy. Small to mid-size examples of it exist across the Amazon. Besides the Brazil nuts and acai harvesters, people are making chocolate from native cocoa. A sustainable fishery for one of the world’s largest freshwater fish has given river communities an alternative to logging. Production of sneakers for fashionable Parisians has restored hope for a community of rubber tappers who labored on the verge of obsolescence with the advent of synthetic rubber. “The challenge is scale,” Para state Gov. Helder Barbalho said in an interview on the sidelines of the summit. His state is believed to be the only one in Brazil that has an actual bioeconomy plan. Para is Brazil’s top producer of acai, yet its economy is far more dependent on iron ore exports to China. So much land in Para has been converted to pasture for an estimated 27 million cattle that it emits more greenhouse gases than any Amazon country besides Brazil. But when it comes to larger sustainable enterprises, there are few success stories. The brightest example has been cosmetics company Natura, which two decades ago launched a product line using ingredients from traditional Amazon communities and family farms. Developing these relationships took patience and research, said Priscila Matta, sustainability senior manager at Natura. When the company started, local people were felling ucuuba trees to make brooms. They tripled their income by leaving the trees standing and selling the seeds to Natura. That is just one among dozens of Natura's bioingredients, helping the company contribute to the conservation of more than 2 million hectares (about 7,700 square miles) of forest. About 8% of what Natura spent on raw inputs last year went for Amazon bioingredients. They come from 41 communities – home to 9,120 families – who in 2022 received about $9 million, some of it direct payments to keep the forest standing. The bioeconomy pitch can also veer toward pie-in-the-sky. Speaking to reporters at the Amazon Summit, Brazil’s planning and budget minister Simone Tebet said that driving a vibrant economy while keeping the forest standing “is our dream, but dreams exist to be realized.” “Banks are interested,"" Tebet said. “Imagine big industries without smokestacks, industries for the good, taking root in Amazon states ... learning from the Indigenous people from whom everything comes.” Para state’s bioeconomy plan strikes a similarly utopian tone: “The Amazon Forest is like an enormous library of knowledge and wisdom that has yet to be discovered,” it reads. The plan gets into specifics, naming 43 forest-compatible products that could be exported, including acai, cocoa, cassava, pepper, fish species and essential oils for cosmetics. Para has started building a complex to serve as a bioeconomy incubator to house researchers and start-ups, scheduled for completion before the state capital of Belem hosts the 2025 global climate conference. Para's public bank, Banpara, has launched a subsidized lending program for small farmers who want to develop agroforestry. “We can balance the scenario of a living forest and people being cared for, being seen,” Barbalho said in the interview. Neighboring Amazonas state is developing a bioeconomy plan with the financial support of the U.S. Agency for International Development. The federal government is also starting to move beyond mere words. This month, Brazil’s economy minister, Fernando Haddad, announced an Ecological Transformation Plan. It proposes using a climate fund to back sustainability projects and setting up rules for Brazil’s carbon market. But some earlier efforts reveal pitfalls. A state condom factory in the Amazon city of Xapuri that opened in 2008 during President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva’s previous term was supposed to provide a market for hundreds of rubber-tapper families living in the region where the late environmental leader Chico Mendes was killed. The factory closed 10 years later, after federal subsidies came to an end. Locals resorted to cattle ranching and today the region ranks high for deforestation. Cocoa beans are another cautionary tale. The trees can be a way to let forest grow back where it has been cut down but its appeal in places like the Ivory Coast and Ghana has meant massive deforestation to make way for the more lucrative trees. Salazar, the CEO of Mazo Mana, the forest shake company, views his enterprise as both social-minded and market-savvy. It reserves nearly 10% equity for its partner community associations and, to the extent possible, production takes place locally to add value and develop expertise. Salazar thinks the sustainable companies that succeed and grow big will be those with a mission to solve the Amazon’s problems, and they will drive a transformation toward an economy that recognizes the value of the forest. ___ Associated Press reporter Fabiano Maisonnave contributed from Belem. ___ Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

2023-11-16,Poverty is killing the Amazon rainforest. Treating soil and farmers better can help save what's left,306,"TEKOHAW, Brazil — At dawn in this small Amazonian village in Brazil's Para state, flocks of noisy green parrots soar overhead as children run and play between wooden homes, kicking up sandy soil — in places white and bare as a beach. The ground reveals one of the paradoxes of the rainforest. Renowned for its beauty and biodiversity, the life-giving nutrients of the forest are mostly stored in the trees and other plants, not the soil. When the forest is cleared — for a cattle ranch, soybean field or even a small cluster of village homes — the combination of scorching Amazonian sun and intense rainfall combine to leach scarce nutrients from the soil in just a few years, leaving behind surprisingly barren ground. Soil rich in organic matter is black, but here it’s sometimes the color of bone. Some ecologists call it a “wet desert.” This impoverished dirt makes it difficult to sustain agriculture in one place. And in a region with some of the highest poverty levels in Brazil, people with few options have often just abandoned degraded fields and cleared more forest — hastening the cycle of deforestation that threatens the planet’s climate and the millions of species unique to the Amazon. “The biodiversity is rich, but so many people are very poor,” said Judson Ferreira Valentim, a soil scientist for the government’s agricultural research agency, Embrapa. “We can’t protect the rainforest without addressing the poverty of the Amazon.” ___ EDITORS’ NOTE — This story is part of The Protein Problem, an AP series that examines the question: Can we feed this growing world without starving the planet? To see the full project, visit https://projects.apnews.com/features/2023/the-protein-problem/index.html ___ The only way to meet both goals is to find more paths for people to make a living in the Amazon without further destroying the rainforest, say experts who have long worked in the region. That means using already deforested land more efficiently — to reduce pressure to clear more forest — as well as supporting businesses that sustainably harvest native products such as açaí and cacao. Valentim, who works in the northern state of Acre, where he’s lived for four decades, points from the window of his truck to areas of abandoned farmland: some are patches of bare soil or red clay; some are overgrown with dark shrubby weeds. The scale of abandoned farm and pastureland across the Brazilian Amazon is massive — covering an area larger than Portugal, according to an AP analysis of data derived from satellite imagery by the Brazilian research collaboration Mapbiomas. Other researchers estimate that ranching, which accounts for between 60% and 80% of deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon, is only a third as productive as it should be, and that increasing the efficiency on the same land area would more than meet increasing demands for meat through 2040. Brazil is a major exporter of beef to global markets, and currently 43% of Brazil’s cattle are raised within the Amazon region, according to an AP analysis of government data. “You have to enforce laws against deforestation, but that’s only part of the solution. You also have to give people alternatives” to improve their livelihoods, said Rachael Garrett, a researcher at Cambridge University who’s conducted fieldwork in the Amazon since 2006. There are 28 million people living in just Brazil’s portion of the Amazon — including Indigenous farmers, ranchers who migrated from other parts of the country, and settlers forcibly relocated decades ago when the government took their old land for infrastructure projects like the Itaipú Dam. “You can’t ignore that millions of people are living there,” Garrett said. “The more their needs are ignored, the worse some problems get.” SUPERCHARGING THE SOIL Nearly everyone in the Amazon starts work early, aiming to finish before the worst of the midday sun. Valentim is on the road at dawn to visit families who’ve tried new techniques to squeeze more production out of the soil. Dairy farmer Edson Cesar de Oliveira waves from his porch. The son of a subsistence rubber tapper from Acre, his family lives in a small wooden home that he built himself. Chickens cluck in the yard, and clothes flap on a laundry line. Cleonice Farina de Oliveira, his wife, offers black espresso and slices of homemade cheese to visitors. For the past few years, the family has been experimenting with planting a native legume called forage peanuts alongside grass in their pastures. This plant attracts bacteria to its roots that can pull nitrogen from the air into the ground, essentially acting as a low-cost natural fertilizer. While grass-only pastures may degrade in just two or three years, adding legumes may extend the soil’s fertility to ten or more years. It’s also higher in protein than grass alone, which helps livestock grow faster. And it’s easier than grass alone on the cattle’s digestive system, reducing their methane emissions. De Oliveria, who said he can’t afford chemical fertilizers, has noticed that pastures with forage peanuts don’t turn as yellow during the dry season. And cows that graze there for at least two nights produce about 20% more milk, he said. That increases the amount of cheese that the family can make to sell in local markets. “We always sell out of our cheese,” said Cleonice, as she pulled on rubber boots to go milk the cows. After coaxing the first three animals into wooden pens, she, her husband and their 22-year-old son Thalisson each took a milking station. The family provides all the labor on their small farm. On another day, Valentim visits a larger family ranch owned by Luiz Augusto Ribeiro do Valle. Do Valle said the last year he cleared new forest to expand the ranch was 2007. Now he’s focused on improving productivity. In addition to planting forage peanuts in his pastures, he has changed the way he grazes cattle. Holding up a detailed map of his ranch, he said, “You take a large pasture, divide it into smaller areas and rotate where the cattle graze.” The goal is to keep cattle always feeding on new grass, while other areas regrow — the new growth is more nutritious and easier to digest. Cows bray in the distance and dragonflies buzz at his feet as he strolls up a hill, periodically bending to inspect the grass. “You have to keep checking the plan against the reality on the ground,” he said. By combining rotational grazing and forage peanuts, he said he can keep between 20% and 40% more cattle on the same amount of land. HARD REALITIES OF THE RAINFOREST But even these simple innovations can be hard for some poor ranchers in the Amazon to implement. In a region with poor roads and spotty internet and cell-phone service, it’s hard to spread information about better farming practices. Many small ranchers can’t afford fertilizers, tractors and other modern farming supplies. And drug trafficking, illegal mining and violence also make it difficult to work on the Amazon frontier. Of the nearly 1 million farms in Brazil’s Amazon region, 83% are small family farms and ranches, according to government figures. Many operate on shoestring budgets. As President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva’s government ramps up enforcement of environmental laws — reversing the policies of Jair Bolsonaro and so far curbing overall deforestation by 22%, according to Brazil's national space agency — some experts say it’s small-scale ranchers and farmers that are still most at risk for clearing rainforest. “When you have fewer choices, you take bigger risks,” said René Poccard-Chapuis, an agronomist at the French agricultural research agency CIRAD who has worked in the region for three decades. Like Valentim, he’s focused on helping farmers and ranchers — especially small operators — find low-cost solutions to improve their livelihoods. In Para state, in the eastern Amazon, Lucas dos Santos has a very modest ranch. He can’t afford a horse to ride or hired labor, but moves the cattle between pastures himself, holding a cattle prod in one hand. He said he was unable to afford the price of new fencing to start rotational grazing for his small herd of 22 cattle. Then CIRAD researchers showed him how to use branch clippings from native trees in place of commercial fence posts. The clippings, taken from trees on his property, put out new roots quickly, so he only had to pay for wires — and can now rotate his cattle. TASTES OF THE RAINFOREST: AÇAÍ AND CACAO César De Mendes is trying to grow a business in the rainforest without cutting any trees at all. Walking through the forest along a tributary of the Amazon in Pará, he points out bright yellow fruits that sprout, sometimes in pairs, from the middle of tree trunks. It’s cacao, the plant responsible for one of the world’s great joys: chocolate. His company, De Mendes Chocolates, uses cacao harvested from virgin rainforest. He’s hoping customers will appreciate how different microclimates and soil conditions across the region subtly impact the flavor of the chocolate. “You can taste the different environments,” he said. His small business sells mostly to upscale groceries and tourist shops. One of six employees at this location, Neilanny Maia, fulfills online orders by hand, devoting a room of her home to storing seed bags and finished chocolate bars. The idea of harvesting rainforest fruits is simple, but scaling up a sustainable business isn’t always easy. Just getting fruit to market before it spoils can be a huge challenge. Last year during the rainy season, one road was closed for 90 days. One solution is to build small processing factories near the forest, as the longstanding agricultural collective Projeto RECA has done in Brazil’s northern state of Rondônia. One afternoon, light breaks through the canopy of virgin rainforest as 37-year-old açaí picker Edson Polinario tilts his head backward, squinting, looking for promising trees. Once he’s chosen his target, he propels himself up the narrow palm trunk, using bands to grip the trunk securely. With a stroke of his machete, he slices off a rack of açaí berries that resemble dark beads on a chandelier. Then he slides down the trunk like it’s a firepole. Every day a worker comes to Polinario’s house to collect bags of açaí, then hauls them back to Projeto RECA’s campus on the back of a motorcycle. Açaí berries spoil quickly and are practically worthless if not processed and frozen within two days. At the factory, they’re transformed into jams, syrups and frozen fruit pulp, ready to be shipped to supermarkets. But there are other challenges to locating the business on the Amazon frontier. If factory equipment breaks, the team must dissemble it and drive parts several hours for repair. “We are too far from the big cities” for on-site maintenance, said Hamilton Condack de Oliveira, the president of the collective of about 200 households. But still, they’ve managed to survive since the collective was founded in 1989. They harvest from both virgin rainforest and agroforests planted on abandoned pastureland. Planting an agroforest — essentially a large orchard of mixed native tree species — doesn’t aid biodiversity and climate as much as simply retaining old-growth forest, but it’s much better than tending pasture or monoculture row crops. “People will visit and say, ‘Oh that’s beautiful,’ but it’s a lot of work,” he said. ‘THE FOREST SUSTAINS US’ The impacts of climate change are already being felt locally in the Amazon region, forcing other adaptations. For as long as their stories tell, the Indigenous Tembé people of Tekohaw village have used fire to clear small plots of land to grow cassava, beans and other subsistence crops. After farming for three years, they’d clear new land. Because their plots were small, the overall impact on the forest was minimal. But now the village chief wants to find other ways to manage the soil’s fertility. “We don’t want to use fire anymore in the forest because we can lose control of the fire, and it can burn the forest,” said Kaparaí Tembé. This wasn’t always as much of a risk, he said. But deforestation from ranching and soy farming for animal feed across the state of Pará has removed moisture from the air, and now the dry season has become longer and drier — heightening the risk of uncontrolled wildfires. “We want to improve agriculture here, in one specific place, not keep burning fields and pushing nature back,” he said, setting his hoe on the ground and mopping the sweat from his brow. “We need to nurture the soil.” Earlier this year, the villagers treated the field with a powder made from grinding up limestone . It’s a technique to reduce the natural acidity of the Amazonian soil. Today Tembé and two other men are planting a different legume, called the pigeon pea, to add nitrogen to the soil. Later, as he walked back to the village, Tembé heard the raucous shriek of a scarlet macaw. “It’s a reminder of where I am,” he said. “The forest sustains us, the animals, the plants — we want to protect it.” ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

2023-09-09,Forests Won't Save Us From Climate Change,307,"Canadian wildfires have this year burned a land area larger than 104 of the world's 195 countries. The carbon dioxide released by them so far is estimated to be nearly 1.5 billion tons -- more than twice as much as Canada releases through transportation, electricity generation, heavy industry, construction and agriculture combined. In fact, it is more than the total emissions of more than 100 of the world's countries -- also combined.   But what is perhaps most striking about this year's fires is that despite their scale, they are merely a continuation of a dangerous trend: Every year since 2001, Canada's forests have emitted more carbon than they've absorbed. That is the central finding of a distressing analysis published last month by Barry Saxifrage in Canada's National Observer, ominously headlined ''Our forests have reached a tipping point.''  In fact, Saxifrage suggests, the tipping point was passed two decades ago, when the country's vast boreal forests, long a reliable ''sink'' for carbon, became instead a carbon ''source.'' In the 2000s, the effect was relatively small. But so far in the 2020s, Canada's forests have raised the country's total emissions by 50 percent.  ''There is this feel-good myth in Canada that our massive forest is offsetting some of our massive fossil fuel emissions,'' Saxifrage writes. ''That might have been true decades ago under our old, stable climate. But we've so weakened our forest -- through decades of business-as-usual industrial logging and fossil-fuelled climate shifts -- that it has switched to hemorrhaging COâ‚‚ instead of absorbing it.''  And, in theory at least, there is a lot more to hemorrhage: Saxifrage calculates that the 3.7 billion tons of carbon dioxide released by Canada's forests since 2001 are only a small fraction of the 100 billion tons stored in its trees and soil. The trends there are not encouraging. ''As extreme as this year's wildfire emissions have been,'' he says, ''they are just the latest escalation in a multi-decade flood of COâ‚‚ pouring out of Canada's 'managed' forests and forestry.''  This is not a simple story of wildfire and climate change but also of logging and forest management. Roughly speaking, when trees logged and trees replanted and regrown are in balance, a forest's ability to absorb carbon is stable. But beginning in the early 2000s, twice as much carbon-absorbing ability was destroyed through logging as was regenerated by replanting. In the decades since, the forest has largely stopped regenerating at all. In the 1990s Canadian forests were sequestering 165 million tons of carbon each year, 20 million more than the carbon-storage loss by logging. In the 2010s those same forests released 35 million more tons of carbon each year than they stored, not including the additional carbon released by logging. In the 2020s, that number has grown to 180 million tons released annually.  It all seems very Canadian. This is a country that promotes itself as a soft-spoken environmentalist leader, endowed with an endless forest landscape, but which nevertheless expands its pipelines, mocks the idea of leaving fossil fuels in the ground and routinely arrests climate activists. Canada is one of the few countries with more per capita emissions than the United States; in fact, its overall carbon production has actually grown since 1990, with the country producing more than 20 percent more carbon dioxide in 2019 than it did three decades earlier. This year, in the hellish midst of its worst fire season in modern history, Alberta actually hit pause on new renewable energy projects -- a pause that may derail 118 projects worth $33 billion.  But the story is much larger than Canada. Over the past decade or two, the world has really invested in the promise of forests as a climate solution, not just in the vaguely conceived ''billion trees'' or ''8 billion trees'' or ''trillion trees'' proposals endorsed by supporters as various as Marc Benioff and Donald Trump and the World Wildlife Fund, but in elaborate offset projects and carbon-credit markets designed to mitigate the effects of industrial emissions by planting enough trees to absorb all that carbon through photosynthesis.  These proposals always stretched the veneer of plausibility. Planting a trillion trees would mean essentially standing up a new Amazon, and offsetting a meaningful share of the world's fossil fuel emissions would require, it's been estimated, turning over a third of the planet's arable land to tree plantations. Offsetting all of them could require more than all the farmland on Earth. And because they eventually die, trees don't store carbon permanently, even when they don't combust and even when plantations are impeccably managed, which they rarely are.  But in recent months carbon offsetting has begun to look like an outright sham, with reports illustrating the emptiness of a vast majority of programs, particularly those that pay skimpily for poorly monitored projects in the developing world.  In one particularly scathing review in Science, researchers estimated that only 6 percent of 89 million carbon offsets would be associated with real carbon reductions. My colleague Peter Coy recently noted that the British bank Barclays suggested that the cost of offsets had fallen by more than three-quarters in just a year, a reflection of how little faith those buying them have in their reliability; voluntary carbon markets are shrinking for the first time in seven years out of growing skepticism. And last month in The Guardian, Patrick Greenfield speculated that carbon-credit speculators stood to lose many billions as the world came to realize that nearly all of the offsets being sold were ''worthless.'' A 2020 study showed that much-celebrated offsets sold for the Brazilian Amazon had barely slowed deforestation there. And a white paper published this summer by Joe Romm argued that the whole project of mitigating emissions through carbon offsets using forest replantation was ''unscalable, unjust and unfixable.''  I wouldn't be quite so fatalistic. Planting trees is still good, all else being equal, and can offer some climate benefits, if more limited ones than optimistic assessments suggest. And it is perhaps too cynical to judge offsets by the failures of the past. (If we judge all climate solutions by that standard, nearly all fail.) Even in a world of continued warming, some of the analyses show, forests can be managed better, deforestation more effectively combated and carbon more reliably stored. Logging practices can be reformed and deforestation in places like the Amazon can be reversed. In fact, under President Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva of Brazil, they already are, with rates of Amazon clearing down 34 percent from January to June.  But the world's most precious rainforest is still in quite a lot of trouble, as Daniel Grossman documented last month in Nature. A 2021 review of 590 plane flights documenting forest behavior found that carbon uptake was weakening across the region and that in the southeast Amazon, the forest had already become a net source of carbon dioxide -- raising alarm that the ecosystem may already be approaching a much-feared tipping point. Other studies have suggested that the rainforest as a whole may already have flipped from a carbon sink to a carbon source.  ''What we were predicting to happen perhaps in two or three decades is already taking place,'' one of those alarm-raising researchers told Grossman. And while policymakers discussing the transformation of the Amazon often emphasize the role of deforestation, which theoretically can be reversed, other research has suggested a larger impact of other warming-related changes, including fire. ''We are killing this ecosystem directly and indirectly,'' the climate scientist Luciana Gatti, who led the 2021 review, told Grossman. ''This is what scares me terribly and why it's affecting me so much when I come here. I'm observing the forest dying.''  Worrying trends have also been observed in the Congo basin. In less consequential places, such as the Czech Republic, countries have come to rely on forest uptake to manage their own carbon footprints -- only to see those forests turned into carbon sources by warming. Some forests elsewhere in the world may offer more encouraging trends. But according to UNESCO, forests in 10 World Heritage Sites have been net carbon emitters over the past two decades. And for those of us raised on generations of naturalist fables -- from ''The Lorax'' to ''The Overstory'' -- the recent fires in Canada may be a disorienting cultural tipping point. If we thought trees might save us, that is looking increasingly like a foolish bet. In many parts of the world, including some of the most densely forested, trees are not perfect allies for tree-huggers anymore, and forests no longer reliable climate partners. What was once the embodiment of environmental values now seems increasingly to be fighting for the other side. In some places, fighting harder each year. https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/06/opinion/columnists/forest-fires-climate-change.html Graphic   This article appeared in print on page A18. "
2023-09-06,Forests Are No Longer Our Climate Friends; David Wallace-Wells,308,"Canadian wildfires have this year burned a land area larger than 104 of the world’s 195 countries. The carbon dioxide released by them so far is estimated to be nearly 1.5 billion tons — more than twice as much as Canada releases through transportation, electricity generation, heavy industry, construction and agriculture combined. In fact, it is more than the total emissions of more than 100 of the world’s countries — also combined. But what is perhaps most striking about this year’s fires is that despite their scale, they are merely a continuation of a dangerous trend: Every year since 2001, Canada’s forests have emitted more carbon than they’ve absorbed. That is the central finding of a distressing analysis published last month by Barry Saxifrage in Canada’s National Observer, ominously headlined “Our forests have reached a tipping point.” In fact, Saxifrage suggests, the tipping point was passed two decades ago, when the country’s vast boreal forests, long a reliable “sink” for carbon, became instead a carbon “source.” In the 2000s, the effect was relatively small. But so far in the 2020s, Canada’s forests have raised the country’s total emissions by 50 percent. “There is this feel-good myth in Canada that our massive forest is offsetting some of our massive fossil fuel emissions,” Saxifrage writes. “That might have been true decades ago under our old, stable climate. But we’ve so weakened our forest — through decades of business-as-usual industrial logging and fossil-fuelled climate shifts — that it has switched to hemorrhaging CO₂ instead of absorbing it.” And, in theory at least, there is a lot more to hemorrhage: Saxifrage calculates that the 3.7 billion tons of carbon dioxide released by Canada’s forests since 2001 are only a small fraction of the 100 billion tons stored in its trees and soil. The trends there are not encouraging. “As extreme as this year’s wildfire emissions have been,” he says, “they are just the latest escalation in a multi-decade flood of CO₂ pouring out of Canada’s ‘managed’ forests and forestry.” This is not a simple story of wildfire and climate change but also of logging and forest management. Roughly speaking, when trees logged and trees replanted and regrown are in balance, a forest’s ability to absorb carbon is stable. But beginning in the early 2000s, twice as much carbon-absorbing ability was destroyed through logging as was regenerated by replanting.

2023-08-08,"Brazil has 1.7 million Indigenous people, near double the count from prior census, government says",309,"BELEM, Brazil — The diminutive woman with a white feather headdress stood on the stage of the majestic colonial theater in Brazil’s Amazon on Monday and addressed the crowd. The woman, Minister of Indigenous People Sonia Guajajara, declared the day “the milestone of Indigenous participation,” then cited the national statistics institute’s freshly released census data that revealed the full scope of the nation’s Indigenous population: 1,693,535 people. While just 0.8% of Brazil’s population, the figure marks an 89% jump from the nation’s prior census, in 2010, due to greater willingness of people to recognize their roots and better survey methods, including access to previously unreachable villages, she said. The latter largely explains why their numbers within Indigenous territories grew 20%, to 622,066. “This a historic moment with that picture that the statistics agency has made,” she said on the eve of the two-day Amazon Summit in Belem. “It’s a historic moment of the restart of social, popular participation, and of the dialogue of our civil society with government.” The setting seemed symbolic: a theater displaying European décor -- French chandeliers, Italian marble busts and a massive painting across the ceiling depicting Greek deities. It was built during the rubber boom, with fortunes amassed with raw material from deep in the Amazon, and little care for what its extraction implied for local communities. There is no trace of them in the so-called Theater of Peace -- except on Monday many of their descendants could be found from the floor seats up to the balcony boxes, wearing tribal vestments. The gathering formed part of the events leading up to the Amazon Summit, during which presidents and representatives from the eight countries home to the world’s largest tropical rainforests will converge in this city to discuss how best to face up to its myriad challenges. In the so-called Amazon Dialogues during the days before the summit, there was surprisingly diverse participation of delegations from regions of the Amazon. Some boat trips to reach Belem took as long as five days. In some 400 events, representatives of Indigenous groups, riverine communities, fishermen and Afro-descendants discussed topics such as harassment from carbon credit companies, ending deforestation and illegal mining. One of their main demands was to cancel new oil projects in the region. Though the large majority came from Brazil, which holds two-thirds of the Amazon, there were also representatives from all eight countries. Most events took place in the same convention center where the presidents will meet starting on Tuesday. There, Indigenous Warao people from Venezuela sold crafts made of straw next to Kayapo Indigenous people painting their bodies with traditional designs. Riverine community stalls sold native honey, Brazil nuts and cassava flour. There were also protests against oil exploration near the mouth of the Amazon River. “You can clearly see that Brazil has a significant social problem to solve, a social problem left by the previous government,” said Colombian Indigenous leader Anitalia Pijachi Kuyuedo, referring to the administration of far-right former president Jair Bolsonaro. “There are many grievances, much pain, much anger, and you can feel the emotions in the words of those you speak with.” In an interview with The Associated Press on Monday, Guajajara, the minister, agreed that their anxiety has been palpable, but finally they have a forum. “There were six years of the complete silencing of civil society, and spaces for social participation were extinguished. People became very afraid to express themselves,"" Guajajara said. ""This is the first moment when society is once again engaging in dialogue with the federal government.” Brazil’s government had expected 10,000 attendees, but instead, 24,000 had arrived, according to Guajajara. Over 1,200 of them were camping in a private recreational park on Belem’s outskirts, with tents arranged in rows beside the stone trail gently winding through the jungle past waterslides coursing into man-made pools. Early Monday, they were rising to eat breakfast and prepare for the events of the day ahead. Some smiled at the sight of Chief Raoni Metuktire, a leader from the Amazon known throughout the world for defending the environment, sitting on a flimsy chair beside the trail and smoking a pipe. He shook hands and exchanged pleasantries with well-wishers. Diolina Krikati had traveled with about 40 others from her native Maranhao state. In an interview, she stressed the importance of the Amazon for generating the rains that irrigates crops in fields far from the forest – ensuring a livelihood not just for Indigenous people, but many non-Indigenous Brazilians, too. “(The summit) is like taking a moment to hear Indigenous people, and we need to be listened to. It’s a moment we need to speak about our needs, and our difficulties,” said Krikati, 31. Another attendee was Naldinho Kumaruara, 29, a spiritual leader wearing a crown of blue macaw feathers and a necklace made of snake bones, and who held a giant maraca in his hand. Kumaruara had come from his Indigenous territory – threatened by illegal logging and fishing, and predatory tourism – to Belem, the state capital. Already he had spoken with members of Para state’s secretariats of education and health who visited the park, as well also officials of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva’s general secretariat at the convention center. He sees this gathering, bringing together all nations that are stakeholders in the Amazon, as a step forward, and also one that has better likelihood to advance Indigenous causes than others, like the Free Land Camp in the capital Brasilia. “Now it is different, because we can speak for ourselves; It isn’t a white person coming and speaking for us. We are always involved, but we didn’t have a position to speak,” he said. “Today, we can speak.” Later that afternoon, Naldinho was among those in the crowd of Belem’s colonial theater. From an upper balcony, he watched as a group of adolescent Indigenous people stomped and sang on the stage. The interim president of Brazil’s statistics institute Cimar Azeredo announced the revised population statistic to the crowd, saying it had “helped to rediscover Brazil.” Their larger numbers means a greater share of the government resources can be earmarked for investment in Indigenous people’s health and education, Planning and Budget Minister Simone Tebet said at the event. And Guajajara stressed that it also means more money for security – a need she said was underscored just hours earlier, when three people of the Tembe ethnicity were shot. And in coming months, she told the crowd, the federal government will expel invaders from 32 Indigenous territories; her announcement was met by cheers and applause from the audience, plus the shaking of maracas. “Never again a Brazil without us!”"
2023-07-17,EU and Latin American leaders hold a summit hoping to rekindle relationship with long-lost friends,310,"BRUSSELS — Leaders from the European Union and Latin America gingerly hugged and huddled at the opening of their first summit of long-lost relatives in eight years. Monday's opening session didn't turn into a joyful reunion of long-lost friends. Latin American and Caribbean leaders brought century-old recriminations over colonialism and slavery across the Atlantic to the EU's headquarters in Brussels, and added current-day complaints that Europe still doesn't get how to treat former colonies as equal partners in the 21st century. “Most of Europe was, and still is, overwhelmingly the lopsided beneficiary in a relationship in which our Latin America, and our Caribbean, have been and are unequally yoked,” said St. Vincent and the Grenadines Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves, who holds the presidency of the 33-nation Community of Latin American and Caribbean States. European leaders acknowledged time and again that the exploitation of old had been fundamentally wrong, yet insisted that the challenges of today can only be tackled effectively when EU and Latin American countries do so together. “You have to realize that in the past, we didn’t pick up the phone when they had issues. So there is very serious irritation among a great many countries,“ Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said. “That we get this back in our face now is also proof that we, as Europe, sometimes acted a bit arrogantly.” The result was that long-stalled trade agreements — like a huge EU-Mercosur deal — will likely be no closer to resolution when the leaders wrap up their summit Tuesday. And despite weeks and months of preparation, a joint final statement was still in limbo less than a day before the closing of the meeting, highlighted by a dispute over whether to include a condemnation of Russia’s war in Ukraine. If something was on show, it was Central and South America's increased confidence, boosted by a huge injection of funds from China and the knowledge that their critical raw materials will become ever more vital as the EU seeks to end an excessive reliance on Beijing's rare mineral resources. Their last such encounter was in 2015, and since then the COVID-19 pandemic and Brazil's three-year departure from the 33-nation CELAC group had made the Atlantic Ocean separating the two sides seem wider. That view could not be dispelled despite pledges of friendship and EU commitments to spend 45 billion euros ($51 billion) on the partnerships over the next four years. Instead, divisions ranging from Russia's war in Ukraine to trade and deforestation gave extra spice to a meeting that will be considered a success simply if the participants agree to meet more frequently. Problems over including a reference to Russia in the summit statement were especially painful. The EU repeats its unwavering support for Ukraine almost daily. CELAC has member nations like Cuba and Venezuela whose views on Russia contrast with just about every EU nation and others that are neutrals in the war and point out other global conflicts that get less attention. While the EU pushes for strong words on the war, Gonsalves said that “this summit ought not to become another unhelpful battleground for discourses on this matter, which has been and continues to be addressed in other, more relevant fora.” The Netherlands, with France, Spain and Portugal, are EU nations with ties to the Americas going back centuries and that were long based on exploitative colonialism and slavery. And even since the nations wrested independence from European powers, trade has often been seen as a one-way street on which Europeans benefitted first and foremost. In the 21st century, China has steadily been pushing its influence and trade outreach deep into Latin America, and the EU acknowledges it has a geo-strategic battle on its hands. “A lot of European companies have lost ground,” said Parsifal D’Sola, executive director of the Center of Chinese-Latin American Investigations. Still, there is no overstating Europe's clout in Latin America, especially when it comes to the economy. Annual trade between the two blocs has increased 39% over the past decade to 369 billion euros ($414 billion). EU investment in the region stood at 693 billion euros ($777 billion), a 45% increase over the past decade. The EU already has trade deals with 27 of the 33 CELAC nations. It is also why the elephant in the room is the huge EU-Mercosur trade agreement between the EU bloc and Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay, which has foundered for five years just short of full ratification. Unlock that deal, and shared prosperity would be the reward for all involved, von der Leyen said. “All of this is within reach if we get the Mercosur, EU agreement across the finishing line. Our ambition is to settle any remaining differences as soon as possible.” Several EU nations have powerful farm lobbies that seek to keep competition from beef producing nations like Brazil and Argentina at bay. And after then Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro allowed Amazon deforestation to surge to a 15-year high, EU nations have been insisting on tougher environmental standards. “The conclusion of the Mercosur-European Union Agreement is a priority and must be based on mutual trust, not threats,"" said Brazil's current president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. ""The defense of environmental values, which we all share, cannot be an excuse for protectionism.” ___ Associated Press journalists Megan Janetsky in Mexico City, David Biller and Eléonore Hughes in Rio de Janeiro and Angela Charlton in Brussels contributed to this report."
2023-08-03,"Amazon Indigenous are leaving rainforest for cities, and finding urban poverty",311,"ATALAIA DO NORTE, Brazil — In 1976, Binan Tuku ventured to meet a Brazilian government's expedition on the banks of the Itui River in a remote area of the western Amazon rainforest. After some initial suspicion, he and his father accepted machetes and soap in what was the beginning of the Matis tribe's contact with the non-Indigenous world. Nearly 50 years after that meeting, documented in research by anthropologist Barbara Arisi, Tuku's own son Tumi is trying to carve out a living in the impoverished city of Atalaia do Norte. Instead of the traditional blowgun, Tumi held a pastry bag in his hands while working in a bakery, and his face bore none of the tattoos or piercings characteristic of the Matis. “In the village, the quality of education is not as good as in the city,” said Tumi, 24, who hopes to go to college to study medicine or journalism. “I want to engage with non-Indigenous people, learn from the challenges I face, and perhaps one day return to my village to share my understanding of how the city functions with the elders.” Thousands of Indigenous like Tumi are migrating to cities like Atalaia do Norte, some in pursuit of a better education and some drawn by a federal welfare benefit that can ensnare them in urban poverty. Their exodus is leaving villages to wither and raising concern that the world’s largest tropical rainforest — crucial to stemming the worst of climate change — will be left without its most effective guardians. About half of the 6,200 Indigenous people in the Javari Valley now live in urban centers, according to estimates by anthropologist Almério Alves Wadick. The Matis, one of several Indigenous peoples in the region, say almost half their 600 people now live in that city. That number is likely to grow, said Binin Matis, who leads the Matis Indigenous Association and takes the name of his people as his surname. Binin Matis said he fears the loss of his people's language and their exposure to drugs. “In the village, there are few people; it’s the older leaders. The youngsters are in the city,” he said. “No young Matis knows how to make a blowgun, an arrow. When the students go to the village for vacation, they don’t want to learn from the elders. They want to play soccer, have fun, and do things of the white man.” Bushe Matis, president of Univaja, the main association for Indigenous peoples in the Javari Valley, worries that the migration will lead to cuts in health and education programs and the potential revocation of Indigenous territories that might then be opened for mining and drilling. The Amazon came under heavy pressure under far-right President Jair Bolsonaro, who favored development. His single term saw a surge in illegal mining and deforestation hit a 15-year high. Univaja recently established its own surveillance team to guard against illegal fishermen, miners and loggers — a duty previously carried out by the villages. The initiative is crucial to protect isolated Indigenous who could be imperiled by something as simple as flu carried by invaders, Bushe said. Such tension appears to be behind last year’s killings of Indigenous expert Bruno Pereira and British journalist Dom Phillips. Pereira was in the Javari Valley assisting the creation of Univaja's surveillance system. Four fishermen and a businessman are under arrest in the killings. Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has sought to lessen pressure on the Amazon since defeating Bolsonaro in last year's election. He established a Ministry of Indigenous Affairs in part to safeguard Indigenous communities. A crucial part of that is improving education, a significant challenge in remote areas of the Amazon. Indigenous families also face hostility from non-Indigenous residents who see them as competition for limited resources, especially fish. “The Indians come here, the government doesn’t give them food, and they fish on our side,” said fisherman Antonio Alves, 46. “When one of us mistreats someone, it’s for our survival.” The Indigenous migration is being driven in part by a federal program created 20 years ago in Lula's first term. The Bolsa Familia program was launched to provide cash to families if they immunize their children and keep them in school. Tens of thousands of Indigenous families started frequenting cities to withdraw the benefit from state bank branches. There were dire consequences. Indigenous people unaccustomed to handling money sometimes pay more than they should for long boat trips or have their debit cards illegally retained by unscrupulous merchants as collateral for installment or credit purchases. In the city, they stay in precarious conditions, vulnerable to alcohol and disease. Often, the Bolsa Familia payout isn't enough to get them back home. “They conclude that it’s better to stay in the city, receiving this amount and putting it towards studying since there isn’t even a complete primary education in the village,” said Wadick, the anthropologist. Indigenous leaders say village schools are in shambles from poor maintenance and lack of oversight by governments. Many Indigenous teachers have been spending long periods in the city, neglecting their work. But the money isn't enough to cover life in the city, either. The minimum payment is $125 per month, plus small additions for pregnant women and for children depending on age. Indigenous people often compete against each other for poorly paying jobs like collecting garbage or sweeping streets. Many endure hunger. “We need clothing, to eat every day, to pay for electricity, and water bills. If all of that were free, we could sustain ourselves with $125,” said Tumi, who recently left the bakery to work for Univaja. The Ministry of Indigenous Peoples is seeking to rework parts of the program so Indigenous peoples don't have to travel as often to collect payment. Proposals include extending the withdrawal period for the money and flexible payment dates. Another major ministry goal is to improve education in Indigenous territories to reduce the incentive to leave. That's a daunting task with high costs for huge, remote and impoverished areas. Nelly Marubo, an anthropologist who is Indigenous, said her ideal is culturally adapted village schools where students have access to both Indigenous and non-Indigenous knowledge without needing to be in the city. But she was shocked by what she found when, after a five-year absence, she recently visited her native region deep in the Javari Valley to film a documentary about her life. “I always have in my mind lots of children and young people, but unfortunately, this time the visit was very sad,"" she said. ""I found an abandoned village with only four elderly women.” ___ Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

2024-01-22,"In Dark Times, I Told My Little Girl Stories",312,"I was nursing a 4-month-old baby when Jair Bolsonaro won Brazil's presidential election in 2018. It was a disaster, and I knew it right away. My daughter -- let's call her Potato -- kept on sucking while I shed tears over her head. Then I changed her into a rainbow onesie to indicate my displeasure with our future president, who once said he was ''proud to be homophobic.''   There was not much else I could do in my state of exhaustion and despair. But then, on one of those lonely nights of breastfeeding, I started to tell Potato random stories, just to feel less alone and to divert my sad thoughts. Little did I know that this, the simple act of telling tales, would see us through an unhinged far-right presidency and a devastating pandemic. In the toughest of times, it was a lifeline.  I remember the story that started everything: It was the tale of Damon and Pythias, which I had read somewhere and wanted to pass along. According to the myth, they were best friends who traveled to Syracuse, where Pythias did something unpleasant to King Dionysius and was sentenced to death. Pythias wanted to say goodbye to his family, so Damon offered himself as a hostage while Pythias settled his affairs. The king agreed. Nobody expected Pythias to return, but he did. Dionysius was so moved by the demonstration of friendship that he revoked the death sentence.  When I relayed the story's ending, I swear that my baby stopped feeding for a second, her big brown eyes looking at me inquiringly. After that, I decided to tell her any anecdote that came to mind and sounded even remotely child appropriate. This helped me a lot during late-night diaper changes, especially when I also needed to change Potato's soaked bed linens while distracting a cold, outraged baby.  She paid attention -- first to my intonations and then to the narrative, as she began to understand our language. I told her stories of the day I slipped off a boat, the day my bus broke down, the day I mistook apples for tomatoes, the day two buckets flew away through our window, whatever. She loved the story of a friend who was stung by a bee and continued to play a recreational volleyball match with a swollen foot; it's graphic, it's heroic, it's fun.  A little more than a year later, when Potato was a toddler learning to walk and talk, Covid-19 reached the country. By then, I was telling her stories about the environment, Indigenous tribes, the Amazon rainforest and the soaring deforestation rates under Mr. Bolsonaro's watch. Then we began to chat about pathogens, masks, vaccines and science denialists -- like the leader of our country, who aimed for herd immunity and worked against vaccines.  Sharing stories was our way of getting through the long days and nights of social isolation. She showed a special interest in the plot of a novel by Ivan Goncharov, the 19th-century Russian novelist, she picked up from my bedside table. The protagonist, Ilya Ilyich Oblomov, refused to leave his bedroom; for him to move from his bed to a chair takes dozens of pages. (He complied with quarantine before it was cool.)  As she developed her language skills, Potato started to ask difficult questions -- about why the rich could continue to drain our natural resources and why Mr. Bolsonaro hadn't been arrested yet. I tried to convey a hopeful message about the future, but sometimes my despondency was hard to hide. On the other hand, I learned that telling stories to her was a way of thinking out loud and calming my anxieties. This was good for both of us: I got a therapeutic break from my neurosis, and she got a story.  Since Potato didn't have many true stories of her own to share and the outside world was a mess, we often resorted to fiction. All the time, she asked me to tell ''wrong things'' (fictional stories) that were ''long and difficult to understand'' (meaning many characters and plot twists). Sometimes she interrupted me to say: ''No, another one! A story without people.''  She intervened in everything -- the plot, the genre, the dialogue, the characters. She demanded certain props and scenarios. ''Now I want a sad story with Chico Bento,'' she asked one day, referring to a character from a Brazilian comic strip. ''And he sings!'' Recurring cast members in her stories included Greta Thunberg, Oblomov, the sisters Bingo and Bluey (from the Australian animated series ''Bluey''), Mario and Luigi (from the ''Super Mario'' franchise) and Luna (from the Brazilian animated series ''Earth to Luna!'').  In late 2022, Mr. Bolsonaro was voted out of office, defeated by Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. I told my daughter about Mr. Lula's imprisonment, his release, the annulment of his convictions and his comeback as president. Now that's a story. I told her about Mr. Lula's dog, a female black mutt named Resistance who went from living on the streets outside Mr. Lula's prison to the presidential palace. Potato loved that part.  Last year, with Mr. Bolsonaro and Covid-19 out of our lives -- well, sort of -- we could finally concentrate more on experiencing new stories rather than just telling them. Depression, my own faithful black mutt, still follows me around, but I have found more ways to keep it at a certain distance. A good night's sleep is a nice way to start. Things seem lighter.  Potato is now a 5-year-old who knows how to read, write and craft a compelling narrative. A while ago, we were coming home from school when she decided to perform a story inside the crowded bus. (I told her to lower her voice, to little avail.) At one point we were all ''in a very deep cave with a giant, a chicken and a huge ice cream.'' The lady next to us couldn't stop laughing, especially when the plot twist came. We got off at the penultimate stop, so most passengers didn't hear the end, sadly.  Our storytelling has developed in tandem, each of us encouraged by the other. In the past year, I drafted a novel about depression, motherhood, Greek myths and creative writing. Potato wrote and illustrated five books before getting bored: ''Things I Like,'' ''Things I Don't Like,'' ''The Long Dress,'' ''The Crazy Birthday Book'' and ''The Pineapple Singer.'' Life is fuller for both of us: She's been learning to swim and I've been playing beach volleyball, risking the occasional bee sting.  She's been teaching me how to finish a complex narrative when you are despairing and clueless about how to move on: She just appears, flying, as a plot resolution device.

2023-07-03,"Amazon Indigenous are leaving rainforest for cities, and finding urban poverty",313,"ATALAIA DO NORTE, Brazil — In 1976, Binan Tuku ventured to meet a Brazilian government's expedition on the banks of the Itui River in a remote area of the western Amazon rainforest. After some initial suspicion, he and his father accepted machetes and soap in what was the beginning of the Matis tribe's contact with the non-Indigenous world. Nearly 50 years later, Tuku's own son Tumi is trying to carve out a living in the impoverished city of Atalaia do Norte. Instead of the traditional blowgun, Tumi held a pastry bag in his hands while working in a bakery, and his face bore none of the tattoos or piercings characteristic of the Matis. “In the village, the quality of education is not as good as in the city,” said Tumi, 24, who hopes to go to college to study medicine or journalism. “I want to engage with non-Indigenous people, learn from the challenges I face, and perhaps one day return to my village to share my understanding of how the city functions with the elders.” Thousands of Indigenous like Tumi are migrating to cities like Atalaia do Norte, some in pursuit of a better education and some drawn by a federal welfare benefit that can ensnare them in urban poverty. Their exodus is leaving villages to wither and raising concern that the world’s largest tropical rainforest — crucial to stemming the worst of climate change — will be left without its most effective guardians. About half of the 6,200 Indigenous people in the Javari Valley now live in urban centers, according to estimates by anthropologist Almério Alves Wadick. The Matis, one of several Indigenous peoples in the region, say almost half their 600 people now live in that city. That number is likely to grow, said Binin Matis, who leads the Matis Indigenous Association and takes the name of his people as his surname. Binin Matis said he fears the loss of his people's language and their exposure to drugs. “In the village, there are few people; it’s the older leaders. The youngsters are in the city,” he said. “No young Matis knows how to make a blowgun, an arrow. When the students go to the village for vacation, they don’t want to learn from the elders. They want to play soccer, have fun, and do things of the white man.” Bushe Matis, president of Univaja, the main association for Indigenous peoples in the Javari Valley, worries that the migration will lead to cuts in health and education programs and the potential revocation of Indigenous territories that might then be opened for mining and drilling. The Amazon came under heavy pressure under far-right President Jair Bolsonaro, who favored development. His single term saw a surge in illegal mining and deforestation hit a 15-year high. Univaja recently established its own surveillance team to guard against illegal fishermen, miners and loggers — a duty previously carried out by the villages. The initiative is crucial to protect isolated Indigenous who could be imperiled by something as simple as flu carried by invaders, Bushe said. Such tension appears to be behind last year’s killings of Indigenous expert Bruno Pereira and British journalist Dom Phillips. Pereira was in the Javari Valley assisting the creation of Univaja's surveillance system. Four fishermen and a businessman are under arrest in the killings. Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has sought to lessen pressure on the Amazon since defeating Bolsonaro in last year's election. He established a Ministry of Indigenous Affairs in part to safeguard Indigenous communities. A crucial part of that is improving education, a significant challenge in remote areas of the Amazon. Indigenous families also face hostility from non-Indigenous residents who see them as competition for limited resources, especially fish. “The Indians come here, the government doesn’t give them food, and they fish on our side,” said fisherman Antonio Alves, 46. “When one of us mistreats someone, it’s for our survival.” The Indigenous migration is being driven in part by a federal program created 20 years ago in Lula's first term. The Bolsa Familia program was launched to provide cash to families if they immunize their children and keep them in school. Tens of thousands of Indigenous families started frequenting cities to withdraw the benefit from state bank branches. There were dire consequences. Indigenous people unaccustomed to handling money sometimes pay more than they should for long boat trips or have their debit cards illegally retained by unscrupulous merchants as collateral for installment or credit purchases. In the city, they stay in precarious conditions, vulnerable to alcohol and disease. Often, the Bolsa Familia payout isn't enough to get them back home. “They conclude that it’s better to stay in the city, receiving this amount and putting it towards studying since there isn’t even a complete primary education in the village,” said Wadick, the anthropologist. Indigenous leaders say village schools are in shambles from poor maintenance and lack of oversight by governments. Many Indigenous teachers have been spending long periods in the city, neglecting their work. But the money isn't enough to cover life in the city, either. The minimum payment is $125 per month, plus small additions for pregnant women and for children depending on age. Indigenous people often compete against each other for poorly paying jobs like collecting garbage or sweeping streets. Many endure hunger. “We need clothing, to eat every day, to pay for electricity, and water bills. If all of that were free, we could sustain ourselves with $125,” said Tumi, who recently left the bakery to work for Univaja. The Ministry of Indigenous Peoples is seeking to rework parts of the program so Indigenous peoples don't have to travel as often to collect payment. Proposals include extending the withdrawal period for the money and flexible payment dates. Another major ministry goal is to improve education in Indigenous territories to reduce the incentive to leave. That's a daunting task with high costs for huge, remote and impoverished areas. Nelly Marubo, an anthropologist who is Indigenous, said her ideal is culturally adapted village schools where students have access to both Indigenous and non-Indigenous knowledge without needing to be in the city. But she was shocked by what she found when, after a five-year absence, she recently visited her native region deep in the Javari Valley to film a documentary about her life. “I always have in my mind lots of children and young people, but unfortunately, this time the visit was very sad,"" she said. ""I found an abandoned village with only four elderly women.” ___ Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

2024-01-01,How Telling Stories to My Daughter Got Me Through the Darkest Times; Guest Essay,314,"I was nursing a 4-month-old baby when Jair Bolsonaro won Brazil’s presidential election in 2018. It was a disaster, and I knew it right away. My daughter — let’s call her Potato — kept on sucking while I shed tears over her head. Then I changed her into a rainbow onesie to indicate my displeasure with our future president, who once said he was “proud to be homophobic.” There was not much else I could do in my state of exhaustion and despair. But then, on one of those lonely nights of breastfeeding, I started to tell Potato random stories, just to feel less alone and to divert my sad thoughts. Little did I know that this, the simple act of telling tales, would see us through an unhinged far-right presidency and a devastating pandemic. In the toughest of times, it was a lifeline. I remember the story that started everything: It was the tale of Damon and Pythias, which I had read somewhere and wanted to pass along. According to the myth, they were best friends who traveled to Syracuse, where Pythias did something unpleasant to King Dionysius and was sentenced to death. Pythias wanted to say goodbye to his family, so Damon offered himself as a hostage while Pythias settled his affairs. The king agreed. Nobody expected Pythias to return, but he did. Dionysius was so moved by the demonstration of friendship that he revoked the death sentence. When I relayed the story’s ending, I swear that my baby stopped feeding for a second, her big brown eyes looking at me inquiringly. After that, I decided to tell her any anecdote that came to mind and sounded even remotely child appropriate. This helped me a lot during late-night diaper changes, especially when I also needed to change Potato’s soaked bed linens while distracting a cold, outraged baby. She paid attention — first to my intonations and then to the narrative, as she began to understand our language. I told her stories of the day I slipped off a boat, the day my bus broke down, the day I mistook apples for tomatoes, the day two buckets flew away through our window, whatever.

2023-12-01,"Top world leaders talk of climate crisis at UN summit. They say they must act on fossil fuels, war",315,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Dozens of world leaders said they know the planet's dangerously overheating and they are trying to keep it from getting worse. The next step is to turn their soaring rhetoric voiced at the beginning of the United Nations climate conference into action. In the first of two days of the two-week summit, presidents, prime ministers and royals from nations rich and poor trotted up to the microphone Friday to lay out commitments to reduce how much their countries spew heat-trapping gases and asked their colleagues to do better. Critics, advocacy groups and even some leaders themselves said that the words of promise must be followed by deals hammered out by diplomats in the coming days. The conference, called COP28, is a who's who of about 150 of Earth's top decision-makers — except the two most powerful men: Presidents Joe Biden and Xi Jinping of the United States and China. The leaders of the two most carbon-polluting nations were glaringly absent. In a fire-and-brimstone kickoff of the parade of VIPs, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, fresh from melting glaciers in Antarctica and Nepal, said ""Earth's vital signs are failing"" and told leaders, “you can prevent planetary crash and burn.” He referred to inequality and conflicts, mentioning the return of fighting between Israel and Hamas on Friday. “Climate chaos is fanning the flames of injustice,” Guterres said. “Global heating is busting budgets, ballooning food prices, upending energy markets, and feeding a cost-of-living crisis. Climate action can flip the switch.” Jordan's King Abdullah said it was impossible to separate climate change from the war in Gaza. “Climate threats magnify the devastation of war,’’ the king said. “Let’s be inclusive of the most vulnerable Palestinians severely impacted by the war.” Still, Kenya President William Ruto said, ""climate change stands out by far as the defining issue of our era."" He joined many leaders who repeated the major goals of conference organizers to triple renewable energy and double energy efficiency. Those goals aren't controversial, but what to do about fossil fuels is. Guterres, a long-time critic of oil, gas and coal use that is causing climate change, fired his strongest shots yet against the industry, which includes COP28 host country United Arab Emirates, saying, “we cannot save a burning planet with a firehose of fossil fuels.” In a direct challenge to fossil fuel-aligned nations, the U.N. chief said the only way to limit warming to the goal set in 2015 in Paris — 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) since the start of the industrial era — requires eliminating oil, coal and gas use. “Not reduce, not abate. Phase out,"" he said. The conference president on Friday issued a document calling for a “phase-down” of fossil fuels, which experts say is less than a phase-out. But 106 nations in Africa, Europe, the Caribbean and in the Pacific signed a statement calling for a full exit. It's up to the more than 190 countries in the talks to come up with an agreement everyone can be happy with, said conference Director General Majid Al Suwaidi. That exposed the traditional fault lines between rich, industrialized countries and much of the developing world — and between pledges and political action. “Although we’ve made great progress together, the world is just not moving fast enough,"" said British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. He said “major emitters” must speed up delivery of their promises, ""and we must address the disconnect between lofty rhetoric on stages like this and the reality of people’s lives around the world,” he added. Sunak has approved new North Sea oil drilling and pushed further into the future a planned ban in Britain on sales of new gas and diesel cars. He says he's still committed to the U.K.'s goal of reaching net zero carbon emissions by 2050, but is taking a “pragmatic” approach that does not unfairly hit taxpayers — ahead of a possible election next year. Many developing-world leaders pledged to do more to advance solar power and other renewable energies, while calling for technology transfer, help in building resilience against climate disasters and sharing of “best practices” — as Zambian President Hakainde Hichilema put it — from “the North” to help continents like Africa benefit too. President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of Brazil, home to most of the Amazon rainforest, said “the planet is tired of climate agreements that were not fulfilled” and said he's had enough of “eloquent and empty speeches.” Lula called for climate justice for poorer nations that didn’t cause the problem and railed against $2 trillion spent on weapons last year when the money should be spent on fighting hunger and climate change. He said Brazil will stop Amazon deforestation by 2030. Many leaders, including France's Emmanuel Macron and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, took aim at coal. The Japanese leader pledged ending new construction at home of unabated coal-fired power plants, in a clearer show of determination than in the past toward achieving net-zero. While Japan has faced criticism for not setting a timeline for eliminating coal power plants, the country has achieved 20% emissions reduction and is on target to lower that to 46% by 2030. Kishida said Japan will issue the world’s first government transition bond with international certification. Japanese officials say the country aims to fund 20 trillion yen ($135 billion) over the next 10 years to promote private sector investment worth 150 trillion yen ($1 trillion). Xi and Biden are sitting out this COP, just weeks after announcing a bilateral agreement to help cut down on methane emissions. Their deputies, U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris and China's First Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang, are attending instead. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi proposed that the South Asian nation, which is the world’s most populous country and third biggest carbon-polluting nation, host the climate talks in 2028. The Indian leader also announced that his country will spearhead the green credits program, which will likely allow individuals and corporations to purchase credits on a dedicated website yet to be setup to offset their emissions. Many of the leaders represent countries hard hit by floods, storms, drought and heat waves worsened by climate change from the burning of coal, oil and gas. Those include the islands nations of Palau and the Maldives as well as leaders of Pakistan and Libya, which have been devastated by recent floods that killed thousands. Host country United Arab Emirates continued to spend money to show its green credentials, including establishing a $30 billion investment program for climate-friendly technology. The UAE, which also pledged $100 million in a climate damage compensation fund Thursday, added pledges of $300 million in other climate spending on Friday. ___ Associated Press journalists David Keyton in Dubai, UAE; Sibi Arasu in Bengaluru, India; Jill Lawless in London and Mari Yamaguchi in Tokyo contributed to this report. ___ Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

2023-06-08,The Terrible Beauty of Richard Mosse’s Portrait of the Amazon; Critic’s Notebook,316,"The artist wanted to photograph orchids but ended up making “Broken Spectre,” a film about the destruction of the rainforest — his most powerful work yet. In 2018, the artist Richard Mosse was understandably weary. He had spent most of the last decade in places torn by conflict and civil unrest. In the early 2010s, the Irish-born New York-based artist had worked for five years in the Democratic Republic of Congo, photographing and filming the humanitarian disaster that has claimed millions of lives and displaced millions more. That project led to another video and photographic series focusing on the European refugee crisis unfolding around the Mediterranean. Before that, he had embedded with the U.S. Army in Iraq. “I was exhausted,” Mosse said recently, as he recounted the events that led to his latest film installation, “Broken Spectre,” filmed in the Amazon rainforest from 2018 to 2021. “I thought I’d put the superego aside, and just enjoy the simple pleasures of photography. This project essentially began with portraits of orchids.” Mosse booked himself into a remote ecolodge in the Ecuadorean cloud forest, and began photographing plants, lichens, mycelium and insects with a macro lens. He found that many organisms phosphoresce under ultraviolet light, so he created dramatic Technicolor images of the teeming biodiversity on the forest floor. Then in the summer of 2019, images appeared in the news media about fires burning across the Amazon Basin. Mosse called up Trevor Tweeten, the cinematographer who has contributed to Mosse’s film projects since 2008, and they flew down, Tweeten said, “to see what it was about.” “Broken Spectre,” an epic film made from four conjoined projections that total 70 feet across, testifies to the calamitous destruction of the Amazon rainforest: the deliberate burning, the tree-felling, the industrial-scale agriculture, the mineral extraction and the displacement of Indigenous peoples that climate scientists believe is fast approaching a tipping-point from which there may be no return. Part photojournalism, part nature doc, part cinéma vérité, part Western, the film defies categorization. It includes close-ups of plants and vast panoramas shot from helicopters. It features farmers and their families; abattoir workers; wealthy landowners; miners; Indigenous people. With an immersive and often thunderous soundtrack by the experimental composer Ben Frost, the film is both visceral and abstract, beautiful and horrifying. “Broken Spectre” is Mosse’s most powerful and consequential work yet. Mosse, 43, had flown to San Francisco for the film’s U.S. premiere at a new exhibition space, 1201 Minnesota Street, following its presentation in London and in Victoria, Australia, in 2022. (In August it will be included in Converge45, the Portland Biennial.) The invitation to exhibit “Broken Spectre” in San Francisco came from the philanthropists Andy and Deborah Rappaport, founders of the Minnesota Street Project Foundation in the city’s Dogpatch neighborhood. A short walk away, Mosse was opening a simultaneous exhibition at Altman Siegel, his San Francisco gallery: “Occidental,” a group of works including “drone maps” made from tessellated aerial photographs during his time in the Amazon. “Seventy-five percent of the entire Amazon is so degraded by processes of deforestation that we’re now very close to the point where there’s an automatic dieback, and the forest can’t generate its own rain,” Mosse explained. “So it stops being rainforest. Once that happens, it turns quite quickly to savanna.” The enormity of such a chain of events — and their consequences for our planet’s future — challenges comprehension. As he relayed this information, Mosse, who has boyish dimples and an affable manner, did not try to dramatize it, or impress me with its gravity. He must have recited the same facts 100 times. He knows that statistics alone are not sufficient. “We’ve got all the reports, we have the quantitative data, but we still don’t have the adequate image, the qualitative storytelling,” he said. That’s where his art comes in. Mosse has long been concerned with making the unseen visible. In Congo, he used Kodak Aerochrome infrared film to photograph paramilitary rebels against the lush tropical landscape, transforming green tones into alarming shades of hot pink. The culminating film installation, “Enclave,” was presented by Ireland at the Venice Biennale in 2013. For “Incoming,” his three-channel video about the migrant crisis, first shown in 2017, he used a military-grade thermal imaging camera to photograph Syrian battlefields and European refugee camps from many miles away. Mosse is drawn to what he calls “aggravated media” — media whose technological or social histories are entwined, problematically, with what they represent. Aerochrome film, for example, was developed to discover camouflaged soldiers in World War II. Mosse’s thermal imaging camera is internationally classified as a weapon. The multispectral cameras that Mosse and Tweeten used for parts of “Broken Spectre” and for Mosse’s “drone maps” are able to see environmental conditions invisible to the naked eye. Lurid colors correspond to wavelengths both above and below the range of human vision. This technology helps scientists assess the damage done to the Amazon, but it is also commonly used by Brazilian farmers to identify how best to exploit their land. The Amazon can be a dangerous place — and was especially so during the administration of the former Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro, when regulations safeguarding the environment were loosened, or not enforced. One recent study estimated that 99 percent of deforestation in the Amazon is illegal, much of it connected to organized crime. The remote settlements that have sprung up near gold mines are lawless, violent places, inhabited mainly by young miners who are paid in gold and supplied with drugs by cartels. One day, in June 2021, Mosse read reports of a skirmish between Indigenous Yanomami villagers and garimpeiros, or illegal gold miners. The miners brought with them diseases, including malaria, which was sickening the villagers’ children. Young Yanomami women were coerced into prostitution, bringing more disease. The gold mining process involves the use of mercury, traces of which get washed into the river, harming the wildlife and entering the villagers’ food supply. “They used to live in paradise,” Mosse said. “All of a sudden they’re living in hell.” Mosse read about how the villagers fastened a wire across the river, blocking a boat loaded with valuable diesel on its way to the garimpeiro settlement. They seized the diesel and burned it. The garimpeiros fired back, and several villagers were killed. That night and many nights later, garimpeiros (or the cartels protecting them) fired automatic weapons into the villagers’ huts. Mosse hurriedly booked flights to Boa Vista, in northern Brazil. From there, he chartered a Cessna aircraft to take him to the village. Traveling with him were his “fixer-translator,” Alessandro Falco, and the Yanomami’s regional leader, Júnior Hekurari Yanomami. In the most memorable and impactful scene of the film, one of the villagers, a woman named Adneia, directly addresses the camera. At first, her fury is aimed at the Brazilian president: “Bolsonaro, you parasite. You keep sending the gold miners to our land. It’s sickening. It’s disgusting, you foul man.” Her subtitled diatribe continues for more than five minutes. (Tweeten’s 35 mm film camera had to be reloaded twice, so the film intermittently cuts to black.) As her voice cracks with emotion, it becomes clear that Adneia’s entreaties are no longer meant for Bolsonaro, but for the white filmmakers before her — and by extension, us, the viewers. “You say you’re here to support us,” she chides. “Don’t say that for nothing.” For a long time, Mosse said he struggled with Adneia’s mandate. “We’re just artists!” he said. “The best we can do — the only thing we can do really — is what we’re good at, which is to communicate to as many people as we can.” Mosse now describes “Broken Spectre” as his first activist film. When “Broken Spectre” was shown in London, Mosse recalls, John Kerry, President Biden’s climate envoy, saw the film, and soon after Mosse received an email from Kerry’s office requesting an online screening link. The next day, Kerry was to meet with Brazil’s new president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, and the minister of environment and climate change, Marina Silva, and he wanted to share the film with them. Mosse says he has no idea if “Broken Spectre” was in any way responsible, but soon after, the Brazilian military began stopping the garimpeiros mining in the area. “That’s what Adneia was asking for!” Mosse says. “She was asking us to tell the senior level of U.S. government which we’ve somehow managed to do.

2023-06-09,Bearing Witness to Paradise Being Plundered,317,"The artist wanted to photograph orchids but ended up making ''Broken Spectre,'' a film about the destruction of the rainforest -- his most powerful work yet. In 2018, the artist Richard Mosse was understandably weary. He had spent most of the last decade in places torn by conflict and civil unrest.   In the early 2010s, the Irish-born New York-based artist had worked for five years in the Democratic Republic of Congo, photographing and filming the humanitarian disaster that has claimed millions of lives and displaced millions more. That project led to another video and photographic series focusing on the European refugee crisis unfolding around the Mediterranean. Before that, he had embedded with the U.S. Army in Iraq.  ''I was exhausted,'' Mosse said recently, as he recounted the events that led to his latest film installation, ''Broken Spectre,'' filmed in the Amazon rainforest from 2018 to 2021. ''I thought I'd put the superego aside, and just enjoy the simple pleasures of photography. This project essentially began with portraits of orchids.''  Mosse booked himself into a remote ecolodge in the Ecuadorean cloud forest, and began photographing plants, lichens, mycelium and insects with a macro lens. He found that many organisms phosphoresce under ultraviolet light, so he created dramatic Technicolor images of the teeming biodiversity on the forest floor.  Then in the summer of 2019, images appeared in the news media about fires burning across the Amazon Basin. Mosse called up Trevor Tweeten, the cinematographer who has contributed to Mosse's film projects since 2008, and they flew down, Tweeten said, ''to see what it was about.''  ''Broken Spectre,'' an epic film made from four conjoined projections that total 70 feet across, testifies to the calamitous destruction of the Amazon rainforest: the deliberate burning, the tree-felling, the industrial-scale agriculture, the mineral extraction and the displacement of Indigenous peoples that climate scientists believe is fast approaching a tipping-point from which there may be no return.  Part photojournalism, part nature doc, part cinéma vérité, part Western, the film defies categorization. It includes close-ups of plants and vast panoramas shot from helicopters. It features farmers and their families; abattoir workers; wealthy landowners; miners; Indigenous people.  With an immersive and often thunderous soundtrack by the experimental composer Ben Frost, the film is both visceral and abstract, beautiful and horrifying. ''Broken Spectre'' is Mosse's most powerful and consequential work yet.  Mosse, 43, had flown to San Francisco for the film's U.S. premiere at a new exhibition space, 1201 Minnesota Street, following its presentation in London and in Victoria, Australia, in 2022. (In August it will be included in Converge45, the Portland Biennial.)  The invitation to exhibit ''Broken Spectre'' in San Francisco came from the philanthropists Andy and Deborah Rappaport, founders of the Minnesota Street Project Foundation in the city's Dogpatch neighborhood.  A short walk away, Mosse was opening a simultaneous exhibition at Altman Siegel, his San Francisco gallery: ''Occidental,'' a group of works including ''drone maps'' made from tessellated aerial photographs during his time in the Amazon.  ''Seventy-five percent of the entire Amazon is so degraded by processes of deforestation that we're now very close to the point where there's an automatic dieback, and the forest can't generate its own rain,'' Mosse explained. ''So it stops being rainforest. Once that happens, it turns quite quickly to savanna.''  The enormity of such a chain of events -- and their consequences for our planet's future -- challenges comprehension. As he relayed this information, Mosse, who has boyish dimples and an affable manner, did not try to dramatize it, or impress me with its gravity. He must have recited the same facts 100 times. He knows that statistics alone are not sufficient.  ''We've got all the reports, we have the quantitative data, but we still don't have the adequate image, the qualitative storytelling,'' he said. That's where his art comes in.  Mosse has long been concerned with making the unseen visible. In Congo, he used Kodak Aerochrome infrared film to photograph paramilitary rebels against the lush tropical landscape, transforming green tones into alarming shades of hot pink. The culminating film installation, ''Enclave,'' was presented by Ireland at the Venice Biennale in 2013.  For ''Incoming,'' his three-channel video about the migrant crisis, first shown in 2017, he used a military-grade thermal imaging camera to photograph Syrian battlefields and European refugee camps from many miles away.  Mosse is drawn to what he calls ''aggravated media'' -- media whose technological or social histories are entwined, problematically, with what they represent. Aerochrome film, for example, was developed to discover camouflaged soldiers in World War II. Mosse's thermal imaging camera is internationally classified as a weapon.  The multispectral cameras that Mosse and Tweeten used for parts of ''Broken Spectre'' and for Mosse's ''drone maps'' are able to see environmental conditions invisible to the naked eye. Lurid colors correspond to wavelengths both above and below the range of human vision. This technology helps scientists assess the damage done to the Amazon, but it is also commonly used by Brazilian farmers to identify how best to exploit their land.  The Amazon can be a dangerous place -- and was especially so during the administration of the former Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro, when regulations safeguarding the environment were loosened, or not enforced. One recent study estimated that 99 percent of deforestation in the Amazon is illegal, much of it connected to organized crime. The remote settlements that have sprung up near gold mines are lawless, violent places, inhabited mainly by young miners who are paid in gold and supplied with drugs by cartels.  One day, in June 2021, Mosse read reports of a skirmish between Indigenous Yanomami villagers and garimpeiros, or illegal gold miners. The miners brought with them diseases, including malaria, which was sickening the villagers' children. Young Yanomami women were coerced into prostitution, bringing more disease. The gold mining process involves the use of mercury, traces of which get washed into the river, harming the wildlife and entering the villagers' food supply.  ''They used to live in paradise,'' Mosse said. ''All of a sudden they're living in hell.''  Mosse read about how the villagers fastened a wire across the river, blocking a boat loaded with valuable diesel on its way to the garimpeiro settlement. They seized the diesel and burned it. The garimpeiros fired back, and several villagers were killed. That night and many nights later, garimpeiros (or the cartels protecting them) fired automatic weapons into the villagers' huts.  Mosse hurriedly booked flights to Boa Vista, in northern Brazil. From there, he chartered a Cessna aircraft to take him to the village. Traveling with him were his ''fixer-translator,'' Alessandro Falco, and the Yanomami's regional leader, Júnior Hekurari Yanomami.  In the most memorable and impactful scene of the film, one of the villagers, a woman named Adneia, directly addresses the camera. At first, her fury is aimed at the Brazilian president: ''Bolsonaro, you parasite. You keep sending the gold miners to our land. It's sickening. It's disgusting, you foul man.''  Her subtitled diatribe continues for more than five minutes. (Tweeten's 35 mm film camera had to be reloaded twice, so the film intermittently cuts to black.) As her voice cracks with emotion, it becomes clear that Adneia's entreaties are no longer meant for Bolsonaro, but for the white filmmakers before her -- and by extension, us, the viewers.  ''You say you're here to support us,'' she chides. ''Don't say that for nothing.''  For a long time, Mosse said he struggled with Adneia's mandate. ''We're just artists!'' he said. ''The best we can do -- the only thing we can do really -- is what we're good at, which is to communicate to as many people as we can.''  Mosse now describes ''Broken Spectre'' as his first activist film.  When ''Broken Spectre'' was shown in London, Mosse recalls, John Kerry, President Biden's climate envoy, saw the film, and soon after Mosse received an email from Kerry's office requesting an online screening link. The next day, Kerry was to meet with Brazil's new president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, and the minister of environment and climate change, Marina Silva, and he wanted to share the film with them.  Mosse says he has no idea if ''Broken Spectre'' was in any way responsible, but soon after, the Brazilian military began stopping the garimpeiros mining in the area. ''That's what Adneia was asking for!'' Mosse says. ''She was asking us to tell the senior level of U.S. government which we've somehow managed to do. For me, that's just the power of art.''

2024-01-23,Jane Goodall Says 2024 is the ‘Most Consequential Voting Year’,318," “Every vote matters, more this year than perhaps any time in history.” When I caught up with Jane Goodall in 2019, she was calling on consumers and businesses to make responsible choices and protect the natural world.  Now she is telling people something much more simple: vote.  The celebrated primatologist thinks governments around the globe are not working hard enough to combat climate change. And in a year when more than 40 countries — including the United States, India and South Africa — will be electing their leaders, Goodall is telling anyone who will listen that the health of Earth itself is on the ballot. “Half of the population of the planet is going to be voting,” she said on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos last week. “This year could be the most consequential voting year in terms of the fate of our planet.” As my colleague Manuela Andreoni wrote last week, the leaders elected this year will face consequential choices on energy policy, deforestation and emissions reductions. In the United States, Republicans are planning to undo environmental regulations if former president Donald J. Trump wins re-election. In Mexico, the favorite to win the presidency in June is Claudia Sheinbaum, a climate scientist who is now mayor of Mexico City and has vowed to take action to reduce emissions. Goodall noted that the outcomes of national elections can have profound and immediate impacts. She pointed to Brazil, where two years ago, voters ousted the far-right leader, Jair Bolsonaro, and brought back President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. Overnight, Lula abandoned Bolsonaro’s laissez-faire approach to environmental regulation and redoubled efforts to protect the Amazon rainforest.  Similar swings in policy will reverberate around the world as people go to the polls in the months to come, Goodall said: “Every vote matters, more this year than perhaps any time in history.” ‘The wealthy are being hit’ Goodall refrained from endorsing specific candidates.  But she believes that as extreme weather batters every corner of the globe, more voters were coming to understand that climate policies matter.  “When climate change began to make itself known, it was Bangladesh and the poorer countries that were suffering,” she said. “Now the wealthy are being hit. The industrialized countries are being hit where it hurts them economically.” In the United States alone last year, there were 28 storms, wildfires or other disasters that each cost at least $1 billion or more in damages, my colleague Christopher Flavelle reported this month. “There are floods in New York, floods in Britain, floods in several parts of Europe, unprecedented heat waves killing people in France,” Goodall told me. “It has changed.” Yet in what is expected to be a tight race between President Biden and Trump, climate is not one of the dominant issues of the campaign. Inasmuch as it is a factor, it is often invoked by activists who believe the Biden administration is not doing enough to curb emissions, or by Trump with promises to expand oil and gas drilling. Goodall also expressed hope that companies could do more to reduce emissions. Just as voters might respond to climate crises at the polls, she said corporations might begin funneling their lobbying dollars toward candidates who prioritized climate issues. “I’m hoping that because companies are being hit economically, some of them will think, ‘Well, we better put a bit more money into the right politicians,’” she said. ‘An all of the above moment’ Goodall, who turns 90 in a few months, was in Davos talking up her efforts to educate young people about the plight of the natural world — and to bend the ear of the policymakers and C.E.O.s who sought her out for selfies. Elections, she said, matter to the degree that they help preserve the natural world.  “The ecosystem is this tapestry of interconnected plants and animals, and each single one has a role to play,” she said. “When a species becomes extinct, it’s like pulling a thread. And if enough threads are pulled, the tapestry hangs in tatters. The ecosystem will collapse.” Goodall, who spent decades living in the jungle studying chimpanzees, is not dogmatic in her approach to fighting climate change. “We need the technology,” she said. “We need transfer to renewable energy. We need to stop subsidizing fossil fuel companies. We must think about human population with its cattle. It’s an all-of-the-above moment.” But she said those policies will only be enacted by leaders who appreciate the gravity of the crises facing planet Earth. “We’ve got to get the message out there for people to understand, and then they’ll vote in the right way,” she said. “Then they’ll understand how important it is for their children, and their children’s children.” Geoexchange students: Colleges drill for clean energy To slash carbon emissions, a growing number of colleges and universities are digging deep, using underground pipes to heat and cool their buildings without burning fossil fuels. Princeton University is spending hundreds of millions of dollars on a new system that will heat and cool buildings using a process known as geoexchange. It starts with a big, muddy mess, as thousands of boreholes are drilled around campus. But the holes will eventually be undetectable, and able to perform an impressive sleight of hand. During hot months, heat drawn from Princeton’s buildings will be stored in thick pipes deep underground; in the winter, the heat will be drawn back up again. “This is what saving the planet looks like,” said the aptly named Ted Borer, head of energy plants at Princeton. “It’s hugely chaotic. It’s messy. It’s disruptive.” But, he added, “There’ll be kids playing Frisbee here a year from now.” Among the colleges where geoexchange or geothermal systems are being tested, installed or are in use are Smith, Oberlin, Dartmouth, Mount Holyoke, Carleton College, Ball State University, William &amp; Mary, Cornell University, Brown University and Columbia University. Many of the colleges are using their projects as a classroom, conducting educational seminars and tours. Lindsey Olsen, associate vice president and senior mechanical engineer at Salas O’Brien, a technical engineering firm, said five years ago, the company was working on two or three campus geothermal projects at one time. That figure has grown to between 20 and 30 projects, she said. Around the country, geoexchange systems are generating enthusiasm from students, faculty, staff and alumni. “I’m not always the person they’re applauding at a faculty meeting,” said David DeSwert, executive vice president for finance and administration at Smith College, where a geothermal system is expected to cut carbon emissions by 90 percent. “When we were presenting this, they were extremely, extremely happy.” — Cara Buckley Other climate news An atmospheric river wreaked havoc in San Diego, sparking flash floods and sweeping away cars.  Exxon Mobil is suing two activist investors to prevent a climate proposal from getting a shareholder vote. The U.S. global food security envoy is pushing to bring back traditional African crops that American policies helped to sideline. New York may soon join a growing number of states seeking to incorporate climate change into school lesson plans. Rising temperatures are threatening Swiss glaciers, which have long been considered Europe’s water tower. Reusing rare earth metalsfrom old tech gadgets could meet much of global demand.

2023-08-08,Curbing Contrails: A Climate Solution in the Skies,319,"The wispy condensation from jet airplanes can trap vast amounts of heat in the atmosphere. Slowing down climate change is going to require big fixes, and many small ones, too.  Case in point: contrails, those wispy white lines that trail some airplanes flying high in the sky. Contrails, short for condensation trails, are produced when exhaust from jets mixes with water vapor at extremely high altitudes, forming minuscule ice particles. Scientists have known for decades that in some cases, contrails spread out across huge areas, trapping heat in the atmosphere. That may sound insignificant given the vastness of the sky. Yet studies have estimated that contrails are responsible for as much as 35 percent of all of the planetary warming attributable to aviation. By some measures, contrails account for upward of 1 percent of human-caused global warming. “We now know enough about contrails and their impact to know we need to do something about it,” said Andrew Chen of RMI, a nonprofit that promotes sustainability. Here’s the new part: A team from Google, Breakthrough Energy and American Airlines says it has demonstrated a relatively cheap and easy way to significantly reduce contrails. Their research, which was shared exclusively with Climate Forward before being submitted to a scientific journal, found that adjusting a plane’s altitude by just a couple thousand feet reduced contrail formation by more than half. The results, they say, suggest it could be relatively easy, quick and cheap to start reducing contrails at scale. “The opportunity here is twofold,” said Chen, who was not involved in the project. “It’s near-term, and it’s cost-effective.” (And for the record: Contrails are not a bioweapon used to control the masses, as some conspiracy theorists would have you believe.) Changing altitudes The researchers used weather and satellite data, along with some machine learning, to develop a model that predicts where contrails are most likely to form.  Using the model created by Google and Breakthrough, American slightly altered the flight paths of 70 daytime flights. Pilots flew one leg of a round-trip journey at an altitude where contrails were expected to form. Going the other way, they flew at a slightly lower altitude, hoping to avoid contrail formation.  After the flights, the researchers looked at satellite imagery and determined that in total, the flights at the lower altitudes produced 54 percent fewer contrails. “It’s a really exciting study,” said Chen. “I’m very pleased with the design, and it will help us answer a bunch of very high-priority questions right now.” There was a cost: Flights avoiding contrails used 2 percent more fuel on average, because flying at lower altitudes expends more energy. That’s a big problem for an industry in which one of the biggest expenses is jet fuel — American spent nearly $14 billion on it last year.  “Burning more jet fuel is not inconsequential to American or to any other airline,” said Jill Blickstein, the airline’s vice president of sustainability. “We wouldn’t do this at any cost.” Moreover, it wouldn’t make much sense for the broader climate challenges to have airlines burn more jet fuel just to prevent contrails.  But the researchers say they expect that only a small fraction of flights will need to change altitude to avoid contrails, and that in total, the additional fuel burn should be only 0.3 percent higher, resulting in a relatively cost-effective way to reduce global warming, even as the larger fight to reduce fossil-fuel consumption continues. The challenges ahead Beyond the potential costs, there are questions and challenges that need to be addressed before contrail avoidance becomes a routine part of commercial aviation.  The contrails that produce the most warming are those that form at night. They block heat that is rising from the ground, without any offsetting reflection of incoming sunlight. But the tests conducted by American took place during the day. The researchers say they are confident their approach will be just as successful during night flights, but it will take more tests to prove them right. Then there’s the matter of making this technology widely accessible. The researchers say they’re talking with the Federal Aviation Administration about integrating forecasts for contrails into flight-management software, just like turbulence forecasts.  (A study published in Geophysical Research Letters in June found that climate change hadincreased the amount of turbulence on popular flight routes by more than 50 percent since the 1970s.) “The airline industry knows how to avoid turbulence,” said Juliet Rothenberg, the lead product manager for climate A.I. at Google. “It’s a very straightforward extension to avoid contrails.” Others are working on the problem, too, including Eurocontrol, a pan-Europe aviation organization; Delta, which is working with M.I.T.; and Satavia, a British start-up that is working with Etihad and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines. There are also other ways to reduce contrails. Using low-carbon aviation fuel, which is in limited use but growing fast, can also help because its exhaust contains less soot. Reducing contrails alone won’t solve aviation’s climate-change problem. Air travel is responsible for about 3.5 percent of human-caused warming, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The much bigger challenge will be finding ways to power jets without fuels that spew planet-warming emissions into the atmosphere — or to simply fly less. But the experiment by Google, Breakthrough and American is the most promising sign yet that contrail avoidance can work. It points to a relatively cheap, easy and quick way to reduce one source of global warming. “You can’t just do contrail avoidance,” Rothenberg said. “But this is really unique among climate solutions in that it can scale in years, not decades.” Forest countries unite for the Amazon The countries of the Amazon Basin are holding the highest profile meeting in half a century to find common cause in protecting the world’s biggest rainforest. Leaders from Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Peru, Suriname and Venezuela are attending the summit in Belém, Brazil this week, along with attendees from other tropical forest countries, including Indonesia and the Republic of Congo. Attendees criticized wealthy countries for not following through on a promise to deliver $100 billion in climate finance annually to poorer nations. The leaders of Norway, France and Germany were invited to attend the summit but are sending representatives instead. The United States was not invited. It won’t be easy to reach a consensus. Colombia has been pushing for a ban on new oil development in the Amazon, but Brazil is still considering a huge offshore oil drilling project at the mouth of the Amazon River. And an attempt by Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, the president of Brazil, to secure a pledge to end illegal deforestation by 2030 looks like a long shot. Observers don’t expect any bold commitments in Belém, which will host the United Nations COP30 climate meetings in 2025. But just the fact that it’s happening is a step forward, said Alicia Guzmán of the environmental nonprofit Stand.earth. “Whatever the result, it’s a historic summit,” she told me. “Now, governments won’t be able to go back to normal, without thinking of everything they are killing.”  — Manuela Andreoni Other climate news A conservative think tank’s plan for the next Republican president would dismantle efforts to slow global warming.

2023-07-01,Brazil Bars Bolsonaro From Office for Fraud Claims,320,"Brazil's electoral court banned former President Jair Bolsonaro from seeking office until 2030 for spreading false claims about the nation's voting system. Brazilian election officials on Friday blocked former President Jair Bolsonaro from seeking public office until 2030, removing a top contender from the next presidential contest and dealing a significant blow to the country's far-right movement.   Brazil's electoral court ruled that Mr. Bolsonaro had violated Brazil's election laws when, less than three months ahead of last year's vote, he called diplomats to the presidential palace and made baseless claims that the nation's voting systems were likely to be rigged against him.  Five of the court's seven judges voted that Mr. Bolsonaro had abused his power as president when he convened the meeting with diplomats and broadcast it on state television.  ''This response will confirm our faith in the democracy,'' said Alexandre de Moraes, a Supreme Court justice who leads the electoral court, as he cast his vote against Mr. Bolsonaro.  The decision is a sharp and swift rebuke of Mr. Bolsonaro and his effort to undermine Brazil's elections. Just six months ago, Mr. Bolsonaro was president of one of the world's largest democracies. Now his career as a politician is in jeopardy.  Under the ruling, Mr. Bolsonaro, 68, will next be able to run for president in 2030, when he is 75. The next presidential election is scheduled for 2026.  Mr. Bolsonaro said Friday that he was not surprised by the 5-to-2 decision because the court had always been against him. ''Come on. We know that since I took office they said I was going to carry out a coup,'' he told reporters (though he, too, had hinted at that possibility). ''This is not democracy.''  His lawyers had argued that his speech to diplomats was an ''act of government'' aimed at raising legitimate concerns about election security.  Mr. Bolsonaro appeared to accept his fate, saying Friday that he would focus on campaigning for other right-wing candidates.  Yet he is still expected to appeal the ruling to Brazil's Supreme Court, though that body acted aggressively to rein in his power during his presidency. He has harshly attacked the high court for years, calling some justices ''terrorists'' and accusing them of trying to sway the vote against him.  Even if an appeal is successful, Mr. Bolsonaro would face another 15 cases in the electoral court, including accusations that he improperly used public funds to influence the vote and that his campaign ran a coordinated misinformation campaign. Any of those cases could also block him from seeking the presidency.  He is also linked to several criminal investigations, involving whether he provoked his supporters to storm Brazil's halls of power on Jan. 8 and whether he was involved in a scheme to falsify his vaccine records. (Mr. Bolsonaro has declined the Covid-19 vaccine.) A conviction in any criminal case would also render him ineligible for office, in addition to carrying possible prison time.  Mr. Bolsonaro was a shock to Brazil's politics when he was elected president in 2018. A former Army captain and fringe far-right congressman, he rode a populist wave to the presidency on an anti-corruption campaign.  His lone term was marked by controversy from the start, including a sharp rise in deforestation in the Amazon rainforest, a hands-off approach to the pandemic that left nearly 700,000 dead in Brazil and harsh attacks against the press, the judiciary and the left.  But it was his repeated broadsides against Brazil's voting systems that alarmed many Brazilians, as well as the international community, stoking worries that he might try to hold on to power if he lost last October's election.  Mr. Bolsonaro did lose by a slim margin and at first refused to concede. Under pressure from allies and rivals, he eventually agreed to a transition to President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.  Yet, after listening to Mr. Bolsonaro's false claims for years, many Bolsonaro supporters remained convinced that Mr. Lula, a leftist, had stolen the election. On Jan. 8, a week after Mr. Lula took office, thousands of people stormed Brazil's Congress, Supreme Court and presidential offices, hoping to induce the military to take over the government and restore Mr. Bolsonaro as president.  Mr. Bolsonaro said on Friday that the riot was not an attempted coup, but instead ''little old women and little old men, with Brazilian flags on their back and Bibles under their arms.''  Since then, more evidence has emerged that at least some members of Mr. Bolsonaro's inner circle were entertaining ideas of a coup. Brazil's federal police found separate drafts of plans for Mr. Bolsonaro to hold on to power at the home of Mr. Bolsonaro's justice minister and on the phone of his former assistant.  Mr. Bolsonaro's attacks on the voting system and the Jan. 8 riot in Brazil bore a striking resemblance to former president Donald J. Trump's denials that he lost the 2020 election and the Jan. 6, 2021, storming of the U.S. Capitol.  Yet the result for the two former presidents has so far been different. While Mr. Bolsonaro has already been excluded from the next presidential race, Mr. Trump remains the leading contender for the Republican presidential nomination. Mr. Trump could also still run for president even if he is convicted of any of the various criminal charges he faces.  The ruling against Mr. Bolsonaro upends politics in Latin America's largest nation. For years, he has pulled Brazil's conservative movement further to the right with harsh rhetoric against rivals, skepticism of science, a love of guns and an embrace of the culture wars.  He received 49.1 percent of the vote in the 2022 election, just 2.1 million votes behind Mr. Lula, in the nation's closest presidential contest since it returned to democracy in 1985, following a military dictatorship.  Yet conservative leaders in Brazil, with an eye toward Mr. Bolsonaro's legal challenges, have started to move on, touting Tarcísio Gomes de Freitas, the right-wing governor of Brazil's largest state, São Paulo, as the new standard-bearer of the right and a 2026 challenger to Mr. Lula.  ''He is a much more palatable candidate because he doesn't have Bolsonaro's liabilities and because he is making a move to the center,'' said Marta Arretche, a political science professor at the University of São Paulo.  The Brazilian press and pollsters have speculated that Mr. Bolsonaro's wife, Michelle, or two of his sons would run for president. Mr. Bolsonaro said recently that he told Ms. Bolsonaro she doesn't have the necessary experience, ''but she is an excellent campaigner.''  Friday's decision is also further proof that Mr. Moraes, the head of the electoral court, has become one of Brazil's most powerful men.  During Mr. Bolsonaro's administration, Mr. Moraes acted as the most effective check on the president's power, leading investigations into Mr. Bolsonaro and his allies, jailing some of his supporters for what he viewed as threats against Brazil's institutions and ordering tech companies to remove the accounts of many other right-wing voices.  Those tactics raised concerns that he was abusing his power, and Mr. Bolsonaro and his supporters have called Mr. Moraes an authoritarian. On the left, he has been praised as the savior of Brazil's democracy.  Mr. Bolsonaro's case before the electoral court stemmed from a 47-minute meeting on July 18 in which he called dozens of foreign diplomats to the presidential residence to present what he promised was evidence of fraud in past Brazilian elections.  He made unfounded claims that Brazil's voting machines changed ballots for him to other candidates in a previous election and that a 2018 hack of the electoral court's computer network showed the vote could be rigged. But security experts have said the hackers could never gain access to the voting machines or change votes.  The speech was broadcast on the Brazilian government's television network and its social media channels. Some tech companies later took the video down because it spread election misinformation.  As for Mr. Bolsonaro's future plans?

2023-06-30,Brazil Bars Bolsonaro From Office for Election-Fraud Claims,321,"Brazil’s electoral court banned former President Jair Bolsonaro from seeking office until 2030 for spreading false claims about the nation’s voting system. Brazilian election officials on Friday blocked former President Jair Bolsonaro from seeking public office until 2030, removing a top contender from the next presidential contest and dealing a significant blow to the country’s far-right movement. Brazil’s electoral court ruled that Mr. Bolsonaro had violated Brazil’s election laws when, less than three months ahead of last year’s vote, he called diplomats to the presidential palace and made baseless claims that the nation’s voting systems were likely to be rigged against him. Five of the court&#39;s seven judges voted that Mr. Bolsonaro had abused his power as president when he convened the meeting with diplomats and broadcast it on state television. “This response will confirm our faith in the democracy,” said Alexandre de Moraes, a Supreme Court justice who leads the electoral court, as he cast his vote against Mr. Bolsonaro. The decision is a sharp and swift rebuke of Mr. Bolsonaro and his effort to undermine Brazil’s elections. Just six months ago, Mr. Bolsonaro was president of one of the world’s largest democracies. Now his career as a politician is in jeopardy. Under the ruling, Mr. Bolsonaro, 68, will next be able to run for president in 2030, when he is 75. The next presidential election is scheduled for 2026. Mr. Bolsonaro said Friday that he was not surprised by the 5-to-2 decision because the court had always been against him. “Come on. We know that since I took office they said I was going to carry out a coup,” he told reporters (though he, too, had hinted at that possibility). “This is not democracy.” His lawyers had argued that his speech to diplomats was an “act of government” aimed at raising legitimate concerns about election security. Mr. Bolsonaro appeared to accept his fate, saying Friday that he would focus on campaigning for other right-wing candidates. Yet he is still expected to appeal the ruling to Brazil’s Supreme Court, though that body acted aggressively to rein in his power during his presidency. He has harshly attacked the high court for years, calling some justices “terrorists” and accusing them of trying to sway the vote against him. Even if an appeal is successful, Mr. Bolsonaro would face another 15 cases in the electoral court, including accusations that he improperly used public funds to influence the vote and that his campaign ran a coordinated misinformation campaign. Any of those cases could also block him from seeking the presidency. He is also linked to several criminal investigations, involving whether he provoked his supporters to storm Brazil’s halls of power on Jan. 8 and whether he was involved in a scheme to falsify his vaccine records. (Mr. Bolsonaro has declined the Covid-19 vaccine.) A conviction in any criminal case would also render him ineligible for office, in addition to carrying possible prison time. Mr. Bolsonaro was a shock to Brazil’s politics when he was elected president in 2018. A former Army captain and fringe far-right congressman, he rode a populist wave to the presidency on an anti-corruption campaign. His lone term was marked by controversy from the start, including a sharp rise in deforestation in the Amazon rainforest, a hands-off approach to the pandemic that left nearly 700,000 dead in Brazil and harsh attacks against the press, the judiciary and the left. But it was his repeated broadsides against Brazil’s voting systems that alarmed many Brazilians, as well as the international community, stoking worries that he might try to hold on to power if he lost last October’s election. Mr. Bolsonaro did lose by a slim margin and at first refused to concede. Under pressure from allies and rivals, he eventually agreed to a transition to President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. Yet, after listening to Mr. Bolsonaro’s false claims for years, many Bolsonaro supporters remained convinced that Mr. Lula, a leftist, had stolen the election. On Jan. 8, a week after Mr. Lula took office, thousands of people stormed Brazil’s Congress, Supreme Court and presidential offices, hoping to induce the military to take over the government and restore Mr. Bolsonaro as president. Mr. Bolsonaro said on Friday that the riot was not an attempted coup, but instead “little old women and little old men, with Brazilian flags on their back and Bibles under their arms.” Since then, more evidence has emerged that at least some members of Mr. Bolsonaro’s inner circle were entertaining ideas of a coup. Brazil’s federal police found separate drafts of plans for Mr. Bolsonaro to hold on to power at the home of Mr. Bolsonaro’s justice minister and on the phone of his former assistant. Mr. Bolsonaro’s attacks on the voting system and the Jan. 8 riot in Brazil bore a striking resemblance to former president Donald J. Trump’s denials that he lost the 2020 election and the Jan. 6, 2021, storming of the U.S. Capitol. Yet the result for the two former presidents has so far been different. While Mr. Bolsonaro has already been excluded from the next presidential race, Mr. Trump remains the leading contender for the Republican presidential nomination. Mr. Trump could also still run for president even if he is convicted of any of the various criminal charges he faces. The ruling against Mr. Bolsonaro upends politics in Latin America’s largest nation. For years, he has pulled Brazil’s conservative movement further to the right with harsh rhetoric against rivals, skepticism of science, a love of guns and an embrace of the culture wars. He received 49.1 percent of the vote in the 2022 election, just 2.1 million votes behind Mr. Lula, in the nation’s closest presidential contest since it returned to democracy in 1985, following a military dictatorship. Yet conservative leaders in Brazil, with an eye toward Mr. Bolsonaro’s legal challenges, have started to move on, touting Tarcísio Gomes de Freitas, the right-wing governor of Brazil’s largest state, São Paulo, as the new standard-bearer of the right and a 2026 challenger to Mr. Lula. “He is a much more palatable candidate because he doesn’t have Bolsonaro’s liabilities and because he is making a move to the center,” said Marta Arretche, a political science professor at the University of São Paulo. The Brazilian press and pollsters have speculated that Mr. Bolsonaro’s wife, Michelle, or two of his sons would run for president. Mr. Bolsonaro said recently that he told Ms. Bolsonaro she doesn’t have the necessary experience, “but she is an excellent campaigner.” Friday&#39;s decision is also further proof that Mr. Moraes, the head of the electoral court, has become one of Brazil’s most powerful men. During Mr. Bolsonaro’s administration, Mr. Moraes acted as the most effective check on the president’s power, leading investigations into Mr. Bolsonaro and his allies, jailing some of his supporters for what he viewed as threats against Brazil’s institutions and ordering tech companies to remove the accounts of many other right-wing voices. Those tactics raised concerns that he was abusing his power, and Mr. Bolsonaro and his supporters have called Mr. Moraes an authoritarian. On the left, he has been praised as the savior of Brazil’s democracy. Mr. Bolsonaro’s case before the electoral court stemmed from a 47-minute meeting on July 18 in which he called dozens of foreign diplomats to the presidential residence to present what he promised was evidence of fraud in past Brazilian elections. He made unfounded claims that Brazil’s voting machines changed ballots for him to other candidates in a previous election and that a 2018 hack of the electoral court’s computer network showed the vote could be rigged. But security experts have said the hackers could never gain access to the voting machines or change votes. The speech was broadcast on the Brazilian government’s television network and its social media channels. Some tech companies later took the video down because it spread election misinformation. As for Mr. Bolsonaro’s future plans? He told the Brazilian newspaper Folha de São Paulo that during the three months he spent in Florida this year after his election loss, he was offered a job as a “poster boy” for American businesses wanting to reach Brazilians. “I went to a hamburger joint and it filled with people,” he said. “But I don’t want to abandon my country.” Ana Ionova, Letícia Casado and Lis Moriconi contributed reporting.

2023-01-19,"Marina Silva says Brazil will lead the defense of the Amazon after the ""blackout"".",324,"Davos (Switzerland), Jan. 19. The Brazilian Minister of Environment, Marina Silva, said Thursday that the government of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva intends to lead the protection of the Amazon and be a world example despite the difficulties to reduce deforestation after the ""blackout"" left by Jair Bolsonaro. Silva, a recognized environmental leader and who resumed the ministry she exercised during Lula's first government (2003-2006), assured the attendees at the World Economic Forum in Davos (Switzerland) that Brazil already has the experience and scientific knowledge necessary to reduce deforestation in the Amazon to zero by 2030. ""We have a successful experience to reduce deforestation. In Lula's first governments we managed to reduce the rates of destruction of the Amazon by 83%,"" he said. He added that, despite the fact that at that time the government had to start from scratch because there was neither experience nor knowledge to combat deforestation, now we have to start from scratch again after the desolate scenario left by Bolsonaro (2019-2022). ""Now it is more difficult because Bolsonaro caused a blackout in environmental policies; he dismantled the control and oversight bodies; he reduced the budgets for combating deforestation and empowered segments opposed to the protection of forests and indigenous peoples,"" he said. Silva recalled that during Bolsonaro's four years in office, devastation in the world's largest rainforest reached record levels. LULA ACTS QUICKLY And he added that in the first days of Lula's government, who took office for his third term on January 1, the deforestation control plan was already reestablished; the Amazon Fund was reactivated, Bolsonaro's controversial measures such as the one that allowed mining in the Amazon were revoked, and a group with 17 ministries was set up to define preservation policies. ""We are here (in Davos) to say that Brazil returned to the world stage determined to regain its prominence as a driver of initiatives to combat climate change and preserve biodiversity and to join efforts in defining a new, more sustainable development model,"" he said. ""We consider that as the country with the largest extension in the Amazon it is our duty to protect it and we want to lead by example before the world,"" he added. But he clarified that to ensure the success of these efforts it is necessary to have the backing of the countries with which Brazil shares it, as well as the financial and technological support of rich countries and companies. ""Lula is going to travel shortly to participate in a meeting of Amazon countries to think about a common strategy,"" he said in reference to the Amazon summit scheduled for next May. Silva explained that the Brazilian strategy for the preservation of the Amazon has two aspects, one aimed at protecting 57 million hectares still protected, and the other to promote sustainable development to guarantee the livelihood of the 30 million Brazilians living in the region. In the same debate in Davos, entitled ""The Amazon at a crossroads"", the governor of the state of Pará, Helder Barbalho, presented the Bioeconomy Plan created by his administration to guarantee preservation in the second largest Amazonian state in Brazil and which made it possible to reduce deforestation by 21% between 2021 and 2022 and to promote a sustainable economic model.

2023-01-02,"Marina Silva, defender of the Brazilian Amazon to repeat as Minister of Environment",325," In 1994, at the age of 35, she was elected Senator of the Republic, being the youngest person in the history of the country to hold this elected position. Photo: EFE - Andre BorgesAt the end of last week, the recently inaugurated president of Brazil, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, presented the people who will be in charge of the 37 ministries of  the country. The name of Maria Osmarina da Silva Vaz de Lima, better known as Marina Silva, stood out above other appointments, because besides being an old acquaintance of the Brazilian president, she repeats at the head of the Ministry of Environment, a portfolio in which she stood out for her results during her first term. (You can read: A solution to the garbage problem in Leticia) Silva was born 63 years ago in the small community of Breu Velho, which is part of Rio Branco, the capital of the department of Acre, in northern Brazil. He was born into a large family, with ten siblings, but very poor, which is why, from a very young age, he had to dedicate himself to the rubber business, the most predominant in the region and to which his father was dedicated. In her adolescence, hepatitis led her to seek help in Rio Branco, where she was cared for by the Sisters Servants of Mary Reparatrix. During her stay, she thought of becoming a nun and there she found the motivation to learn to read and write. However, her vocation began to change when, entering a church, she came across a notice of a rural union leadership course to be taught by theologian Clodovis Boff and union leader Chico Mendes. (May be of interest to you: A draft law in Peru threatens indigenous peoples in isolation) Since then, her path has been focused on the union, environmental and political struggle. Along with her training as a historian, she was one of the founding members of the Central Única de Trabajadores (CUT) of Acre, together with Mendes, and ran for her first elected positions in her region, although without success. At the age of 32 she was elected as a state deputy and four years later she became a senator in Brasília, the youngest person to reach that position in the history of the country. At that time, she was awarded the Goldman Prize, considered the Nobel Prize for the Environment. In 2002 she was re-elected and a year later, Lula, who was beginning his first term as president, appointed her as Minister of the Environment. (When Silva arrived at that post, deforestation in the Amazon rainforest was at an all-time high, with more than 27,000 square kilometers of forest cleared. For this reason, one of her first actions was the creation of the Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Deforestation in the Legal Amazon (PPCDAm). Three years later, deforestation had been reduced by more than half. For these achievements, and others, the British newspaper The Guardian considered her one of the 50 people who could help save the planet in 2007 and the United Nations (UN) awarded her the 'Champions of the Earth' prize, the organization's main environmental award. However, a year later, her relationship with Lula fractured and Silva resigned from the ministry. The then minister considered that a series of constructions promoted by the government would be harmful to the Amazon, which is why she decided to leave her post and return to the Senate. Two years later, she ran for president, coming in third place, the same position she occupied in 2014, when she repeated her candidacy. She wanted to be president again in 2018. (You may be interested in: A tributary of the Amazon River in Brazil seriously affected by a hydroelectric dam) A week and a half before the first presidential round in Brazil took place, Marina Silva announced her support for Lula. ""Our political reunion is taking place in the face of a serious political situation. We have the threat of threats, a threat to our democracy"", said the now Minister of the Environment at the time. Undoubtedly, Silva's main challenge at the head of the environmental portfolio will be to stop deforestation in the Amazon rainforest, which, according to the Brazilian Institute for Spatial Research (INPE), has increased since Jair Bolsonaro became president in 2009. Susana Muhamad, Colombia's Minister of Environment, celebrated Silva's appointment: ""Congratulations Marina Silva, Colombia and Brazil united to Save the Amazon and the socio-ecological transition. We environmentalists in South America celebrate!"", she said on her Twitter account. (You can read: The evidence of the Prosecutor's Office against three mayors for crossing an illegal road in the Amazon) To face the main challenge of her portfolio, Silva has already announced that ""we will strengthen oversight, we will recompose the public policy, which is the PPCDAm and will be resumed immediately, we will resume the Amazon Fund to provide resources, in addition to strengthening management bodies, such as ICMBio, and oversight bodies, such as Ibama"" . One of the immediate effects of Silva's arrival in office was the change in the name of the ministry, which is now called the Ministry of Environment and Climate Change, as well as the creation of a couple of secretariats: the Extraordinary Secretariat for Combating Deforestation and the Secretariat for Bioeconomy and Genetic Resources. The new Minister of Environment announced that she is already working with her counterpart of Justice to address another of the serious problems that the country is experiencing: environmental crimes.

2023-03-22,Norwegian Minister says Brazil has returned to environmental leadership,327,"Norway's Minister of Climate and Environment, Espen Barth Eide, said on Wednesday (22) that Brazil is resuming the global leadership it once had, when it comes to environmental issues. Thestatement was made during his meeting with the Minister of Environment and Climate Change, Marina Silva. The two ministers released a joint statement in which they reaffirmed the bilateral partnership on climate and forests, which began in 2008, with the launch of the Amazon Fund, by Brazil; and the International Climate and Forests Initiative (NICFI), by Norway. ""Through the 2008 bilateral Memorandum of Understanding, Norway supported the Amazon Fund, which became a model for several other bilateral partnerships. In the following years, Brazil continued to achieve a remarkable reduction in deforestation in the Amazon and delivered one of the most important climate mitigation results in the world,"" the MMA said in a statement. Global leadership Barth Eide told the Brazilian Minister that ""Brazil has shown global leadership in the past and is doing it again now. Still according to the Norwegian, the international community must spare no efforts to mobilize all available tools and resources to partner with the Brazilian government. He reinforced that Norway is ""deeply committed to remaining a close and long-term partner of Brazil. Both Barth Eide and Marina Silva advocated for a ""rapid operationalization of the resources available in the Amazon Fund to support the critical needs identified by Brazil to reduce deforestation and promote sustainable and inclusive development in the Amazon Region."" The Norwegian minister said that his country will support Brazil in mobilizing additional resources for the Amazon Fund, as well as to increase cooperation, investments and public and private financing. ""In this context, both authorities committed to exchange views on how best to take advantage of opportunities emerging from different approaches, including results-based payments and jurisdictional carbon markets,"" the MMA said.

2023-01-27,"One third of Amazon 'degraded' by human activity, drought: study",328,"Manila, Jan. 27 -- WASHINGTON, United States - More than one third of the Amazon rainforest may have been degraded by human activity and drought, researchers said Thursday, and action is needed to protect the critically important ecosystem. In a study published in the journal Science, the researchers said the damage done to the forest which spans nine countries is significantly greater than previously known. For the study, they examined the impact of fire, logging, drought and changes to habitat along the forest borders - what they called edge effects. Most previous research into the Amazon ecosystem has focused on the consequences of deforestation. The study found that fire, timber extraction and edge effects have degraded at least 5.5 percent of all remaining Amazonian forests, or 364,748 square kilometers, between 2001 and 2018. But when the effects of drought are factored in, the degraded area increases to 2.5 million square kms, or 38 percent of the remaining Amazonian forests. ""Extreme droughts have become increasingly frequent in the Amazon as land-use change and human-induced climate change progress, affecting tree mortality, fire incidence, and carbon emissions to the atmosphere,"" the researchers said. ""Forest fires intensify during drought years,"" they said, warning of the dangers of ""much larger megafires"" in the future. The researchers from Brazil's Universidade Estadual de Campinas and other institutions used satellite images and other data from 2001 to 2018 to reach their conclusions. In a separate study published in Science of the human impacts on the Amazon, researchers from the University of Louisiana Lafayette and elsewhere called for action. ""The Amazon is perched to transition rapidly from a largely natural to degraded and transformed landscape, under the combined pressures of regional deforestation and global climate change,"" they said. ""The changes are happening much too rapidly for Amazonian species, peoples, and ecosystems to respond adaptively,"" they said. ""Policies to prevent the worst outcomes are known and must be enacted immediately. ""To fail the Amazon is to fail the biosphere, and we fail to act at our peril,"" they said.

2023-01-13,"Ricardo Galvão, former director of Inpe, to take on presidency of CNPq",330,"The physicist Ricardo Galvão, former director of Inpe (National Institute for Space Research), should be announced as the new president of CNPq (National Council for Scientific and Technological Development) next week. The decision, as reported by Folha, has not yet been officially confirmed, but has already been taken by the Minister of Science, Technology and Innovation, Luciana Santos. Galvão is 75 years old, a professor at the Physics Institute at USP (University of São Paulo), and was a candidate for federal deputy in São Paulo for the Network, but was not elected. In recent months, he participated in the Lula government's transition team. The researcher became known in 2019 for producing in the country. In July of that year, when charged by the foreign press about the high levels of deforestation alerts that had been being registered by Inpe's Deter system, Bolsonaro said he had ""conviction"" that the data were ""liars"" and accused Galvão of being ""at the service of some NGO."" ""I've even asked the guy who is in charge of Inpe to explain himself here in Brasilia, to explain this data that was leaked to the press,"" said the then president. ""Our feeling is that this is not consistent with reality. It even seems that he is at the service of some NGO, which is very common."" It was Bolsonaro's first attack of denialism not only to what was happening in the Amazon, which was suffering from a rapid advance of deforestation, but to data scientifically produced by government agencies themselves. Inpe is linked to the Ministry of Science. Galvão reacted immediately. In an interview to Estadão, he said that Bolsonaro manifested himself ""as if he were in a bar conversation"", with ""improper comments and without any basis"". The researcher, who had started his career at Inpe in 1970 and was at the head of the organ's presidency since 2016 stated, in the same interview, that Bolsonaro ""took a pusillanimous, cowardly attitude"" and said he expected to be called to Brasília to explain the data. ""And that he has the courage to repeat it, looking face to face, in my eyes."" Bolsonaro never spoke to Galvão, continued to deny the data, and exonerated him two weeks later. Inpe's monitoring, however, continued to show, month after month, that deforestation in the Amazon continued unabated. In the four years he has been in office, the Legal Amazon, the area that encompasses the largest tropical forest in the world, has lost 45,586 km2 - an unprecedented 59% increase in relation to the previous four years. In 2022, for the fourth consecutive year, the annual deforestation rate in the Amazon was above 10,000 km2. Galvão's confrontation with Bolsonaro has borne fruit. At the end of 2019 he was chosen by the British science magazine Nature as one of the ten people who were most important to science that year, precisely for having defended scientific knowledge in the face of Bolsonaro. The magazine said Galvão captured global attention when he challenged Bolsonaro for undermining data showing the sharp increase in deforestation rates in the Amazon. ""(They were) acts that he knew would lead to him losing his job. What he didn't know was that he would become a hero of sorts, acclaimed by his fellow scientists as well as by strangers on the street. One woman even stopped him in the subway in São Paulo to thank him for standing up to Bolsonaro and helping her understand why preserving the Amazon is important,"" the scientific journal pointed out at the time. In early 2021, he was also awarded the international award for Scientific Freedom and Responsibility given by the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS). ""Professor Galvão defended sound science in the face of hostility. He acted to protect the welfare of the Brazilian people and the immense natural wonder that is the Amazon rainforest, a world heritage site,"" Jessica Wyndham, director of the AAAS Program on Scientific Responsibility, Human Rights and Law, said in a statement. At the head of CNPq Galvão will have the challenge of helping to rebuild the impaired investment in research. The agency is the federal government's main agency for promoting science and has suffered successive budget cuts and blockages in recent years. The ABC (Brazilian Academy of Sciences) recently highlighted that students in exclusive dedication regime for master's and doctoral degrees receive by CNPq, respectively, R$ 1,500 and R$ 2,200, values that have not been adjusted since 2013. Upon taking office on January 2, Minister Luciana Santos promised to work to readjust the scholarships. According to ABC's calculation, if corrected only by the accumulated inflation over the period, the scholarships should rise to R$2,700 for master's students and R$4,000 for doctoral students.

2023-03-07,Satellite data confirms that the Amazon is losing its forests,331,"The project is called Sentinel-1 for Science: Amazon and, ESA warns, forest ecosystems are rapidly experiencing the effects of climate change, making timely forest monitoring increasingly urgent. Forests play an important role in offsetting anthropogenic fossil fuel emissions. Since 2015, the world's tropical forests can be regularly observed at an unprecedented interval of 6 to 12 days thanks to the Copernicus Sentinel-1 mission, ESA says in a statement. Millions of gigabytes of radar data are acquired both day and night, regardless of cloud cover, haze, smoke or aerosols, making it possible to monitor deforestation and forest degradation at least every two weeks. However, the challenge is to find suitable methods to extract meaningful indicators of forest loss from the huge amounts of incoming radar data so that anomalies in the time series can be detected regularly and consistently across tropical forests. The Sentinel-1 for Science: Amazon project presents a simple and transparent method of using Sentinel-1 satellite radar imagery to estimate forest loss. The project uses a spatio-temporal data cube design, also known as StatCubes - a method for multidimensional and temporal analysis of large amounts of data. With this approach, a dynamic analysis of deforestation in the Amazon basin is created. The team was able to detect a forest loss of more than 5.2 million hectares between 2017 and 2021, which is roughly equivalent to the size of Costa Rica. Neha Hunka, remote sensing expert at Gisat, commented, ""What we are seeing from space is that more than one million hectares of tropical rainforests disappear every year in the Amazon basin, with the worst year being 2021 in Brazil."" ""We can track these losses and report on them transparently and consistently every 12 days from now on.""

2023-01-03,United Kingdom could join Amazon Fund to help Brazil control deforestation: minister,332,"BRASILIA, Jan 3 (Reuters) - The United Kingdom is considering joining the $1 billion Amazon Fund reopened by President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva to finance sustainability in the rainforest, British Environment Minister Therese Coffey said. ""It is something we are seriously considering,"" Coffey told Reuters on Monday in Brasilia, where she attended Lula's inauguration earlier in the day. The minister said the British government was already in talks with the fund's current partners, Norway and Germany, which donated $1.2 billion to set up the initiative. The fund was frozen by the ultra-right government of Jair Bolsonaro, alleging irregularities among the projects managed by NGOs without offering any proof. One of Lula's first decisions upon taking office was to reverse Bolsonaro's policies that weakened environmental protection and helped contribute to deforestation, which reached its highest level in 15 years, including a measure encouraging mining on protected indigenous lands. Lula also reopened the Amazon Fund. The UK is already Brazil's third largest environmental partner, having committed more than 250 million pounds from its international pilot fund, said the official, who met with Environment Minister Marina Silva, Agriculture Minister Carlos Favaro and Indigenous Peoples Minister Sonia Guajajara. Indigenous communities were especially hit by illegal mining that advanced along with deforestation in the Amazon under Bolsonaro's government. ""I see the desire and intention to reverse that,"" she said. Coffey added that Pará governor Helder Barbalho had invited her to visit his vast Amazon state to see projects in the rainforest, which she had never experienced before. ""I hope it will change my life,"" she said.

2023-01-04,United Kingdom to fund Amazon Fund to boost sustainability in the rainforest,333,"TheUnited Kingdom is considering joining the Amazon Fund, formed by Norway and Germany, to finance sustainability in the Amazon rainforest. This was explained this Wednesday, January 4, 2023, by the British Minister for the Environment, Agriculture and Rural Affairs, Thérèse Coffey. ""It is something we are seriously analyzing,"" Coffey told the press during her visit to Brazil, where she attended the inauguration of the new president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. As founders of the Amazon Fund, Norway and Germany initially contributed USD 1.2 billion. The fund currently has some US$ 600 million available for environmental protection projects. According to the British minister, her country has much to offer Brazil, including rural sustainability programs and low-carbon architecture to help in mobilizing funds with its strength as a global hub for green finance. Bolsonaro's policies encouraged deforestation in the rainforest The Amazon Fund was frozen by the government of Jair Bolsonaro, who alleged irregularities in the projects managed by NGOs, although without presenting any evidence.

2023-02-10,"With Biden, Lula speaks against inequality and asks for partnership for the environment",334," In a speech next to the American leader, Joe Biden, president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (PT) cited common challenges with the United States and defended democracy, the fight against inequality and preached 'care for the Amazon' and partnership for climate change. ""We now have some problems to work together. First, never again allow there to be a new chapter on Capitol Hill and never again allow what happened in Brazil with the invasion of Congress, the Planalto, and the STF. The second thing that we have to work together is the fight against inequality. The racial issue that, from time to time, I see being practiced in every country, in the USA, in Brazil. Especially young blacks from the periphery are often victims of the incapacity of the state because the violence that exists in the periphery is the absence of the state with public policies to guarantee dreams for youth. ""The third thing is the climate issue. We have had a commitment since 2009 in Copenhagen, when I participated in COP 15 where we made a commitment to reduce deforestation by 80% and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 39% and we have fulfilled it,"" he added. In a poke at former president Jair Bolsonaro (PL), Lula said that ""in recent years, the Amazon has been invaded by political and human irrationality. ""We had a president who ordered deforestation, who ordered mining in indigenous areas, who ordered mining in the forests that we demarcated as a reserve in the Amazon,"" he said. Lula also stressed the goal of zero deforestation in the Amazon by 2030 and that he intends to transform it into ""a research center shared with the whole world."" ""I made a commitment that by 2030 we will reach zero deforestation in the Amazon. We are going to make a great effort to transform the Amazon, not into a sanctuary for humanity, but into a research center shared with the entire world so that we can take advantage of the wealth of biodiversity in the Amazon, to see if we can transform this wealth into an improvement in the quality of life of the people who live in the Amazon,"" he pointed out. ""Caring for the Amazon today is caring for planet earth. Taking care of planet earth is taking care of our survival. And, for this reason, we all have the obligation to leave our children and grandchildren a better world than the one we received from our parents"", he pointed out. ""A 300-year-old tree has no owner. Nobody can cut it down. It is a patrimony of humanity. It is there to guarantee the subsistence of the planet and that is why we are going to take the climate issue very seriously"", he added. The Brazilian President also defended the union between Brazil and the USA for a ""global governance"" for measures in favor of the environment. ""We need to establish a new conversation to build a stronger global governance. Because on the climate issue, if we don't have global governance that takes decisions, that all countries are obliged to comply with, if we don't have it, it won't work"". ""I don't know which forum, I don't know if in the UN, in the G20, in the G8, but something has to be done to oblige the countries, our Congress, businessmen to comply with the decisions that we take at a global level. If this doesn't happen, our discussion about the climate issue will be greatly impaired. I don't think we have much time. We urgently need to take action. In Brazil, we will do what is possible to do"". Finally, he added that ""both the USA and the rest of the world can count on Brazil in the fight for democracy and in the fight for environmental preservation"". ""This is not a government program. It is a commitment of faith from someone who believes in humanism, in fraternity, in solidarity. I don't want to live in a world where humans will turn into algorithms. I want to live in a world where humans are human. And, for this, we need to take great care of what God has given us, which is planet earth,"" he concluded.

2023-03-22,"""Water loss is a wake-up call for climate change""",335,"Brazil concentrates the largest volume of fresh water in the world, but it has been drying up in recent decades. For a specialist, the reduction indicates ongoing global warming.Brazil concentrates the largest volume of fresh water in the world: 12% of the planet's hydric reserves and 53% of the hydric resources of South America are in national territory. Despite this abundance, the country has experienced three major droughts in the last 20 years. The most recent one, which occurred in 2021, was the most severe recorded in 90 years. A survey by the network of scientists MapBiomas also showed that Brazil is drying up: while in 1991 the country was covered by 19.7 million hectares of water, in 2022 this area will fall to 18.2 million hectares, a decrease of almost 8% of the water surface. This loss, according to the coordinator of the MapBiomas Água platform, Carlos Souza Junior, may be related to the decrease in underground water, the aquifers, which supply rivers and other water bodies. The specialist also points to climate change and deforestation as factors that explain this worrying scenario. ""A deforested land, that is, without vegetation, does not have time to absorb the water, because the runoff on its surface is very fast. Without absorption, the soil and subsoil can't be replenished,"" Souza said. In an interview with DW, Souza points out the importance of the Amazon forest in regulating rainfall in Brazil and the entire American continent, and suggests ways to try to halt the ongoing drought in the country. DW: The area covered by freshwater in Brazil has decreased by about 8% in the last three decades. What does it mean to say that the country has lost water surface area? Carlos Souza Junior: We don't have a definite diagnosis yet, but we have a study in the São Francisco River basin that shows that the reduction of water surface had a high correlation with the reduction of water in aquifers. That is, if the amount of water on the surface is being reduced, possibly the aquifers are already compromised. The Amazon and the Atlantic Forest have the largest freshwater reserves in Brazil, concentrating 60% and 12% of all water resources in the territory, but the Cerrado is the biome considered the country's water body. Why? The Cerrado is home to many river springs. For this reason, it plays an important role in providing water for various basins both inside and outside the biome. Despite this water importance, the Cerrado suffers very strong pressure from agribusiness, an activity that is a great consumer of water and is linked to deforestation. Speaking of deforestation, how does it interfere with the amount of freshwater available in the country? The natural vegetation is important to balance the humidity and local temperature, since it can retain the water on the land and, therefore, reduce the return of solar radiation to the atmosphere. However, a deforested terrain, that is, without vegetation, does not have time to absorb the water, because the runoff on its surface is very fast. Without the absorption, there is no supply of soil and subsoil. When we think only of the Amazon, a region rich in rivers, is the impact of deforestation on the hydrological cycle greater? Deforestation in the Amazon is a local problem, because it affects the hydrographic basins of the deforested region, but also global, since the forest works as a powerful hydraulic pump capable of regulating the hydrologic cycle of the entire American continent. When it rains, the roots of the vegetation absorb the water and retain it in the soil. This water absorbed by the forest will return to the atmosphere through the transpiration of the plants and will supply the clouds, which will be carried to other regions by means of the winds. This is the process called flying rivers. However, as we remove the forest, the Amazon ecosystem loses its ability to return moisture to the atmosphere, lacking the water to supply the clouds. So by interfering with the flying rivers, deforestation in the Amazon could affect rainfall on the continent. Is it possible to tell if climate change is already affecting the amount of freshwater in Brazil? Aquatic systems are the most vulnerable to climate effects. One example is the várzea areas in the Amazon, a type of vegetation that is temporarily or permanently flooded. Even away from the deforestation areas, we have observed that the várzeas are losing water. If it is not deforestation of the forest, the cause of the várzeas drying up is evaporation caused by local warming, since summers in the Amazon are increasingly dry, long, and hot. In other words, the loss of water in the várzeas is a warning that climate change is already causing changes in our aquatic systems, as is the reduction of water in the Pantanal. [Between 1985 and 2022, the water surface in the Pantanal has decreased by 81.7%, according to data from MapBiomas Água]. Although Brazil recovered 1.7 million hectares of water last year compared to 2021, a year in which the country recorded the lowest amount of freshwater in the last 30 years, the decrease in water surface in Mato Grosso (-48%) and Mato Grosso do Sul (-23%) draw attention. What explains these losses in both states? The water loss in these states is a result of the removal of natural vegetation over time, coupled with climate change, which is amplified in these locations by deforestation. Without natural vegetation, these states have difficulty absorbing and retaining water in the soil. There is also the presence of infrastructure that affects the quantity of water, such as small, medium, and large-scale dams, which reduce the flow of rivers. How to ensure that fresh drinking water will not be lacking in the future? With a set of measures that involve everything from public policies to mass awareness campaigns about the rational use of water and conservation. Each one has to do his or her part. It will also be necessary to stop deforestation in all biomes, besides avoiding the construction of dams and reservoirs, changing the production logic of agribusiness and investing in landscape planning to avoid very extensive agricultural production fields without vegetation. There is also the issue of chemical inputs in the field, such as fertilizers and pesticides used in large-scale agriculture. With the rains, these inputs flow into the aquatic ecosystems, causing a serious problem of contamination of the biodiversity in rivers and lakes and of the groundwater. If we reach a critical point of fresh water availability, is desalination of seawater an option? This is something very expensive. If we get to the level of having to resort to desalination of water, we have already lost the fight against climate change.

2023-01-27,38% of the Amazon would have been degraded,336,"Washington, United States AFP In a study published in the journal Science, researchers say the damage done to that forest that spans nine countries is significantly greater than previously known. For the study, the authors examined the impact of fires, logging, droughts and habitat changes along forest boundaries, known in ecology as edge effects. Most previous studies of the Amazon ecosystem have focused on the consequences of deforestation. Impact This study found that fires, timber extraction, and edge effects have degraded at least 5.5% of the remaining Amazon forest, or about 364,748 square kilometers, between 2001 and 2018. However, when drought effects appear, the degraded area increases to 2.5 million square kilometers, 38% of the Amazon forest. ""Extreme droughts have become increasingly frequent in the Amazon as land use change and human-induced climate change progress, affecting tree mortality, fire incidence and carbon emissions to the atmosphere,"" the study states. ""Wildfires intensify during drought years,"" they say, and warn of the dangers of ""much larger megafires"" in the future. Researchers from the State University of Campinas in Brazil and other institutions used satellite imagery and other data from 2001 to 2018 to reach their conclusions. President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has ratified his commitment to end deforestation in the Amazon by 2030. After his inauguration, the president signed a series of decrees to strengthen the protection of the Amazon. In one of the first measures, Lula revoked a decree authorizing mining on indigenous lands. Impact on species ""The Amazon is headed for a rapid transition from being a huge natural landscape to one degraded and transformed by the combined pressures of local deforestation and global climate change,"" they anticipated. ""Changes are happening much faster for Amazonian species, people and ecosystems,"" they warned. ""Policies to prevent the worst consequences are well known and must be put in place immediately."" Environment President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva spoke with his French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron, about ""challenges"" with the environment and the ""risks"" of the extreme right for democracy.

2023-02-03,Amazon: deforestation alerts show a drop in January,337," Four days before the closing of January 2023 data, the deforestation alert in the Amazon made by the Deter system indicates a drop in the historical series. The accumulated number of alerts in the Legal Amazon is 121 km2, the third lowest mark for the month so far in the historical series, which began in 2015. The figures are from the Institute for Space Research (Inpe). The Legal Amazon corresponds to 59% of the Brazilian territory and encompasses the area of eight states (Acre, Amapá, Amazonas, Mato Grosso, Pará, Rondônia, Roraima and Tocantins). The alerts are made by Deter, which produces daily signals of changes in forest cover for areas larger than three hectares, both for fully deforested areas and for those in the process of forest degradation (by logging, mining, burning and others). The data may change until the completion of the data analysis by Inpe, which usually reviews the influence of factors such as cloud cover on the measurement of the rates. So far, at 121 km² - an area the size of the city of Niterói -, the rate this year was only above the 2017 and 2021 marks, when the index reached 58 and 83 km², respectively. The Minister for the Environment and Climate Change, Marina Silva, criticized the environmental policy of recent years and stressed the new government's commitment to zero deforestation in the biome, one of President Lula's campaign promises. Despite this one-time drop, deforestation in the Amazon grew by 59.5% during the four years of former president Jair Bolsonaro's (PL) administration, the highest percentage increase in a presidential term since satellite measurements began in 1988.

2023-01-04,Amazon: more than 80% of protected areas are threatened,338,"By 2023, if the pace of logging is not stopped, the Amazon Rainforest may lose another 11,805 km² of native forest, according to an estimate by the artificial intelligence platform PrevisIA. The size of almost 10 cities in Rio de Janeiro, the predicted devastation will cause even more emissions of greenhouse gases, which are related to the greater frequency and intensity of extreme weather phenomena. Among them are heavy rains, cold and heat waves and prolonged droughts. Developed by Imazon in partnership with Microsoft and Fundo Vale, the tool has already shown an accuracy of almost 80% in predicting deforestation in 2022, which consolidates it as a relevant technology to assist forest protection actions. To validate how accurate PrevisIA was, the researchers crossed the areas that the platform predicted to be at risk of deforestation between August 2021 and July 2022 with the devastation registered by Imazon's Deforestation Alert System (SAD) in the same period. And the result was that 78.2% of the destruction occurred within 4 km of the area indicated by the platform. If this happens, the platform estimates that 2023 will have the second largest deforestation since 2008, second only to 2021. Like Prodes, the federal system that annually monitors deforestation in the Amazon, PrevisIA's risk calculation takes into account the so-called ""deforestation calendar"", which runs from August of one year to July of the following year. Among the nine states that make up the Legal Amazon, the most critical in relation to the risk of deforestation in 2023 are the three largest: Pará, Amazonas and Mato Grosso. Together, they represent 73% of the area under threat of deforestation in 2023 (8,582 km²), according to PrevisIA. This means that state governments will also need to act to prevent this estimate from being realized. Next is Acre, which despite being the second smallest state in the Legal Amazon presented the fourth largest area at risk of deforestation in PrevisIA: 1,269 km². The fifth largest area under threat is Rondônia, 1,094 km², a state that, like Acre, borders Amazonas. On the tool's map it is possible to see that the forests under greatest risk in these states are precisely on their borders, where there is an area of agricultural expansion called Amacro. Besides the states, PrevisIA also points out the municipalities with the forest areas under the greatest risk of devastation in 2023. Among the first 10, half are in Pará. Of the 803 protected areas in the Amazon (indigenous lands, conservation units and quilombola territories), 653 are at risk of deforestation in 2023, according to PrevisIA. This represents 81% of all protected territories. Regarding the total area at risk in the Amazon, 1,806 km² (15%) are within protected areas. The most threatened are the conservation units, where 1,357 km² of forest are at risk of being cut down. Next are the indigenous lands, with 433 km², and the quilombola territories, with 16 km².

2023-03-10,Amazon and Cerrado record deforestation in February,339,"Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon and Cerrado reached record levels in February, according to official data released on Friday (10), which show President Lula's challenges to reverse environmental destruction. Satellite images detected 322 km2 of destroyed forest cover in the Brazilian part of the largest tropical forest on the planet, an increase of 62% compared to February 2022, which had already been a record, according to the DETER surveillance system, of the National Institute for Space Research (INPE). In the Cerrado, 558 km2 were destroyed, 99% more than in the same period last year and almost double the record of 283 km2 in February 2020. The figures, however, are not surprising, since the highest level had already been recorded on February 17. Nevertheless, the new index is unfavorable for President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who is counting on the support of the international community to reverse the destruction recorded during the term of Jair Bolsonaro (2019-2022). Lula assured that ""Brazil is back"" to fighting climate change, after four years in which the average annual deforestation in the Amazon increased 75% compared to the previous decade. So far, the president has mobilized environmental protection agencies, relaunched a forest protection program, and obtained international support to reactivate the Amazon Fund, which has more than US$ 580 million (about R$ 3 billion) to combat deforestation. Environmental groups have been showing patience with the new government, while waiting for data about the dry season, which begins in July, when deforestation tends to increase. ""It's difficult to reverse the damage of an anti-environmental policy in such a short time,"" said Frederico Machado, from the NGO WWF-Brazil. ""The reduction of deforestation will only occur when there is a consistent reversal of the weakening of the institutions responsible for enforcement,"" he added in a statement. Greenpeace Brazil spokesman Rômulo Batista celebrated the government's efforts, but warned that Lula will have to implement new strategies. ""Much more work will be needed,"" he said."
2023-01-29,Amazon at risk: degradation equivalent to ten times the size of the United Kingdom,340,"A report by the scientific journal Science revealed that forest fires, illegal logging and other human activities have degraded more than a third of the world's forests, an extension equivalent to the surface of the United Kingdom multiplied by ten. A group of 35 scientists worked on the diagnosis, which focuses on the environmental policies to be implemented in this region, considered the ""lungs of the planet"". Degradation differs from deforestation in that the use of the affected land does not change - that is, it continues to be forest - despite the disappearance of most of the trees and vegetation. At least 2.5 million square kilometers of the forested area, 38 percent, was affected, temporarily or permanently, by this phenomenon in less than 20 years.  The amount of pollutant emissions resulting from this process, the experts found, is equal to, or even greater than, that produced by deforestation. ""Despite the uncertainty about the total effect of these alterations, it is clear that their cumulative effect may be just as important as deforestation in terms of carbon emissions and biodiversity loss,"" explained one of the authors, Jos Barlow, in a statement. The researchers warned that anthropogenic changes are occurring ""much faster"" than previously thought, and much more so than natural environmental changes in the past. ""Most analyses of land-use change in the Amazon rainforest have focused on the causes and effects of deforestation. However, anthropogenic disturbances also cause degradation of the Amazon rainforest and threaten its future,"" they said. In this line, they estimated that these four factors will continue to produce large amounts of polluting emissions, even if deforestation of the Amazon is totally eliminated, so they proposed to create specific monitoring systems that take into account these threats to the environment, in addition to suppressing logging. ""While some disturbances can be addressed by curbing deforestation, others, such as limiting the increase in extreme droughts, require additional measures, including global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,"" the researchers said.

2023-02-10,Amazon deforestation alerts drop by 61% this year,341," The accumulation of deforestation alerts in January 2023 in the Legal Amazon was 167 km², the fourth lowest mark for the month in the historical series of the Real-Time Deforestation Detection System (Deter), which began in 2015. The survey was released on Friday morning (10/2) by the Special Research Institute (Inpe). If this result is compared with January last year, there was a 61% drop. The same period in 2022 marked 430 km² of deforestation. The Legal Amazon corresponds to 59% of the Brazilian territory, and encompasses the area of eight states: Acre, Amapá, Amazonas, Mato Grosso, Pará, Rondônia, Roraima, Tocantins and part of Maranhão. The alerts are made by Deter, which produces daily signals of changes in forest cover for areas larger than three hectares, both for fully deforested areas and for those in the process of forest degradation (by logging, mining, burning and others). At 167 km², this year's rate was only above the marks for 2017, 2019, and 2021, when the rate reached 58, 136, and 83 km², respectively.

2023-01-27,"Amazon deforestation drops in January, according to partial data from Inpe",342,"The Amazon lost 99 km² of forest in January of this year, according to data from Deter, an alert system from Inpe (National Institute for Space Research), published on Friday (27). Updated to the 20th, the numbers should still increase by the end of the month, but are well below the 430 km² recorded in January last year, under former president Jair Bolsonaro (PL). The number so far is the third lowest in the recent historical series of Deter (Deforestation Detection System in Real Time), which began in 2015. It is above 2017, which recorded 58.2 km², and 2021, with 82.8 km² of forest cut down. The indicators are the first in the government of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (PT), which has Marina Silva (Rede) who returned to the command of the Environment portfolio 15 years after her first passage and in a much more complex context for the fight against deforestation. With weakened enforcement in recent years, criminal organizations have increased gold mining on indigenous lands, land grabbing and illegal timber schemes. Still, the Lula government needs to face this scenario in order to fulfill the promises of zero deforestation and emissions reduction, reinforced in his inauguration speech and even before. In November of last year, the then president-elect went to COP27, the UN (United Nations) climate conference held in Egypt, and signaled that his government would be different from Bolsonaro's, marked by friction with the international community and with foreign sources of funds, such as the Amazon Fund. The first operations against deforestation in the Amazon started last week, when Ibama agents led raids against deforestation in Acre, Pará and Roraima. On January 16, Funai (National Foundation of Indigenous Peoples) revoked the normative instruction that made logging on indigenous lands more flexible, allowing non-indigenous people to participate in the management. The government is also counting on donations from the Amazon Fund, reactivated on January 1st of this year, to resume inspection. On January 18, Marina Silva said at the World Economic Forum in Davos that the fund's donor base can be expanded to reinforce the fight against environmental crimes."
2023-01-07,Amazon deforestation hits record in Bolsonaro administration,343," The Amazon forest lost 218.41 square kilometers (km²) of vegetation in December last year, the last under then-President Jair Bolsonaro's (PL) administration, in yet another record of his administration. The data are from Deter, a system of the National Institute for Space Research (Inpe) that issues alerts to combat deforestation in real time. The record is Bolsonaro's highest for the month of December, compared with the same period in previous years as president. If considered the historical series, starting in 2015, it is the third, behind 2017, which recorded 287.51km², and 2015, which had 266.29km². The numbers are yet to be updated by Inpe, since the information published this Friday (6/1) goes up to December 30th last year - there is one day left to complete the year 2022, therefore. The number more than doubled compared to the same period last year, when the system recorded 87.19km², but caution must be exercised in comparisons, according to Mariana Napolitano, conservation manager at WWF-Brazil.  ""So,"" she says, ""the trend projected by Deter is that deforestation data will remain high and will be confirmed in the next publication of Prodes, another Inpe system."" This is also what the Climate Observatory, a network of several civil society organizations, points out. ""Amazon destruction alerts have hit historic records in recent months, leaving the Lula government with a kind of contracted deforestation, which will negatively influence the figures for 2023,"" says Marcio Astrini, executive secretary of the entity. ""The Bolsonaro government is over, but its harmful environmental legacy will still be felt for a long time. In her inauguration speech last Wednesday, the Minister of the Environment and Climate Change, Marina Silva, announced the creation of an extraordinary secretariat exclusively focused on controlling and combating deforestation. It was during her first term in the ministry in the government of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (PT) that deforestation, with the PPCDAm -or Action Plan for Prevention and Control of Deforestation in the Legal Amazon-, reached an 83% reduction in the rate from 2004 to 2012. According to Napolitano, the restructuring of command and control actions and agencies such as Ibama and ICMBio are important, but the government will need to make a quick effort in the direction of the economy. ""We know that you can't hold and don't want to hold [deforestation] with command and control. What we want is a forest-based economy, in which deforestation no longer makes sense, because keeping the forest standing is more profitable. It is much less risky for everyone,"" he says. The deadline, however, is another challenge: ""We can remember that, with Marina and the PPCDAm, there was a reduction in deforestation in eight years. We don't have eight more years to reduce, we need effort and resources for the response to be more drastic. It is a more critical scenario for climate, water resources, our window for change is smaller"", highlights the specialist. Until the closing of this edition, the Ministry of the Environment had not commented on the new Deter data. "
2023-01-13,Amazon deforestation increased 150% in the last month of Bolsonaro's term in office,344,"Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon increased by 150% in December 2022, Jair Bolsonaro's last month as president of Brazil, compared to the same period of the previous year, according to data analyzed by the Deforestation Detection in Real Time System (DETER), managed by Brazil's National Institute for Space Research. Specifically, the satellites observed the loss of vegetation in 218.4 square kilometers of Amazonian forests last December, while in December 2021 the losses were 87.2 square kilometers. Overall, during 2022, the Brazilian part of the Amazon basin recorded a loss of 10,267 square kilometers of forested areas, the worst figure since, in 2015, the monitoring of this type of data with satellite images began. Until now, the first position in this deforestation ranking was occupied by 2019 (Jair Bolsonaro's first year in office), in which 9,178 square kilometers of forests were deforested in this part of the Amazon basin. Lábrea and Apuí, in the south of the Brazilian Amazon, head the ranking of municipalities with the largest deforested area from August to December 2022. These towns are located on the axis of BR-319 (Manaus-Porto Velho), a highway designed in the 1970s by Brazil's military dictatorship and recovered during the mandate of Jair Bolsonaro. The previous license for the paving of an important part of this road was granted last June, disregarding the opinions of technicians from Brazil's own Ministry of the Environment.  Logging until the last minute Several environmental organizations had warned that burning, logging, land movements and agricultural and mining occupations would increase between the election of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva as president of Brazil and his inauguration. As will be recalled, Lula da Silva has promised that one of the priorities of his government will be to curb deforestation in the Amazon, as he already did during his first two terms in office (2003-2010). ""Bolsonaro's government may be over. but his nefarious environmental legacy will be felt for a long time,"" Marcio Astrini, executive secretary of the Climate Observatory, a coalition of environmental groups in Brazil, has lamented in a statement."
2023-03-09,"Amazon deforestation linked to reduced Tibetan snows, Antarctic ice loss: Study",345,"Mar 08, 2023( Mongabay News: http://news.mongabay.com Delivered by Newstex)   Earth's climate is controlled by a complex network of interactions between the atmosphere, oceans, lands, ice and biosphere. Many elements in this system are now being pushed toward tipping points, beyond which changes become self-sustaining, with the whole Earth system potentially shifting to a new steady state.A recent study analyzed 40 years of air temperature measurements at more than 65,000 locations to investigate how changes in one region rippled through the climate system to affect temperatures in other parts of the globe. Computer models then simulated how these links may be affected by future climate change.Researchers identified a strong correlation between high temperatures in the Amazon Rainforest and on the Tibetan Plateau.  They found a similar relationship between temperatures in the Amazon and the West Antarctic Ice Sheet.Deforestation in the Amazon likely influences the Tibetan Plateau via a convoluted 20,000-kilometer (12,400-mile) pathway driven by atmospheric and oceanic circulation patterns. The study suggests that a healthy, functioning Amazon is crucial not only for the regional climate in Brazil, but for the whole Earth system. There's a recent saying, grown popular among climate scientists: 'What happens in the Arctic doesn't stay in the Arctic[1].' Now, new research adds to our understanding that, likewise, what happens in the Amazon Rainforest doesn't stay there.  Researchers reporting in Nature Climate Change last month found that deforestation in the Amazon Rainforest may have knock-on effects for the climate in distant regions[2], potentially pushing key elements of the global climate system — on the Tibetan Plateau and the West Antarctic Ice Sheet — closer to climatic tipping points that could be catastrophic for humanity and our planet's biodiversity.  Earth's climate is controlled by a complex network of interactions between its atmosphere, oceans, land, ice and biosphere. Scientists have identified many elements of this system that humanity's actions are presently pushing toward thresholds[3], or tipping points, beyond which changes become self-sustaining — ultimately causing the whole Earth system to shift into a new state possibly hostile to life in its current forms.  'Earth system components that have a critical threshold beyond which a system reorganizes are called tipping elements,' explained study co-author Jingfang Fan, an Earth system scientist at Beijing Normal University in China and the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) in Germany. These tipping elements include the Amazon Rainforest biome[4], the East and West Antarctic ice sheets[5], the Arctic permafrost[6], and the Great Barrier Reef[7], among others[8]. It is theorized that a tipping point reached in one region could trigger a tipping point in another, and so on, like toppling dominoes.  Researchers identified a relationship between temperatures in the Amazon and over the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, both of which are key tipping elements in Earth's climate system. Scientists are concerned that the Antarctic ice sheet may have already entered a state of irreversible decline. Image by NASA Goddard Photo and Video via Flickr[9] (CC BY 2.0[10]). The Arc of Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon, a vast swath of former rainforest intruded on by roads, dams and mines, and converted to cattle ranches, soy plantations and other monoculture croplands. This deforestation is contributing to the drying out of the Amazon, possibly leading to the eventual death of the rainforest and conversion of the biome into degraded savanna. Image courtesy of KBHS Social Sciences.  To investigate how different tipping elements in the global climate system may be interconnected, researchers analyzed 40 years of hourly near-surface air temperature measurements accumulated by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecast, across a global grid of more than 65,000 locations, or nodes.  This immense network of data allowed scientists to investigate how changes in one region appear to ripple through the climate system to affect temperatures in other parts of the globe, by comparing the relationships between temperatures at nodes within the Amazon Rainforest with nodes in other regions. The researchers then used computer simulations to model how climate change might affect these connections between various tipping elements through the end of the 21st century.  'This is the first time that the [mathematical] theory of complex networks has been applied in the context of [far distant] tipping points,' said Teng Liu, a Ph.D. researcher in complex systems at Beijing Normal University, who performed the study. 'We found that the Amazon Rainforest exhibits significant teleconnection with other tipping elements.'  The research team identified a strong correlation between temperature anomalies — where regional conditions buck the global trend — in the Amazon Rainforest and the Tibetan Plateau, roughly 15,000 kilometers (9,300 miles) distant. These anomalies allowed the authors to distinguish between the global trend of climatic warming and direct climate connections between distant regions.  The data showed that anomalously warm temperatures in the Amazon and Tibet have coincided over the last 40 years. They found a similar relationship between temperature in the Amazon and on the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, a key tipping element in Earth's climate system.  Simulations of future climate change carried out by the researchers indicated that these connections are likely to be maintained to 2100. These computer models also showed that future extreme climate events in the Amazon and the Tibetan Plateau are likely to be synchronized.  This mathematical study demonstrated that 'if you lost the Amazon [biome,] or if you disrupt the Amazon, there's further knock-on implications elsewhere in the world,' said Tim Lenton, director of the Global Systems Institute at the University of Exeter in the U.K., who was not involved in the study. 'Any advance in credibly mapping out these couplings between tipping elements gives us a richer picture of the kind of non-linear coupled dynamics of the Earth as a system.' Scientists agree that precisely detecting actual tipping points is impossible until you've passed through them, and can only be fully confirmed in hindsight.  The water-cycling capabilities of forests are responsible for generating roughly half the annual rainfall in the Amazon. But concerns have grown that with continued loss and degradation of the rainforest due to human activities, the Amazon biome is transitioning into a new, drier state[11], potentially causing the remaining forest to die out[12] and be replaced by savanna, with profound rippling impacts for the global climate system.  The water-cycling capabilities of forests are responsible for generating roughly half the annual rainfall occurring in the Amazon, but concerns are growing among scientists that continued deforestation and forest degradation there could cause the remaining forest biome to collapse and be replaced by savanna. Such a tipping point event would result in a massive release of carbon stored in rainforest trees and soils, worsening climate change regionally and planetwide. Image 2011CIAT/NeilPalmer via Flickr[13] (CC BY-SA 2.0[14]). Long-distance climate connections  Analyzing their data, the researchers say that deforestation (most of it due to intentionally set fires) in the Amazon may be responsible for the long-distance connection with conditions on the Tibetan Plateau, carried out via atmospheric and oceanic circulation patterns. That connection follows a convoluted, meandering 20,000-km (12,400-mi) pathway that carries air from central South America to the southern coast of Africa, then north, through eastern Africa, finally veering west through the Middle East to the Himalayas, where it reaches the Tibetan Plateau.  'Wind or ocean currents may carry dust or black carbon particles generated by the burning of the Amazon forest, which could then be transported to the Tibetan Plateau via this pathway,' helping warm the atmosphere over Tibet and melt snow, explained Fan. Further research will be needed to confirm and better define these pathways and the intercontinental climate connections they underpin.  The researchers found evidence that 'snow cover in the Tibetan Plateau has been losing stability since 2008, which implies that [it] is an activated tipping element,' said Liu. While the Tibetan Plateau may be close to its tipping point, 'we don't know what kind of new state the Tibetan Plateau will remain in if it crosses the threshold,' Fan warned.  According to the new study, climate conditions in the Amazon Rainforest influence climate and snow cover on the Tibetan Plateau. Warmer temperatures in the Amazon have coincided with warmer temperatures in Tibet over the last 40 years. Image by NASA Johnson via Flickr (CC BY-NC-ND 2.0).  Lenton said it remains unclear whether passing such a threshold on the Tibetan Plateau would lead to the kind of self-sustaining feedback loop that is the defining characteristic of a tipping element, but he agreed that 'abrupt change on the Tibetan Plateau would have quite significant impacts regionally and [likely lead to] climate feedbacks as well.'  The study adds to a growing weight of evidence that a healthy, functioning ecosystem in the Amazon is crucial, both for the regional climate in Brazil and other South American nations, and also for the whole Earth system. But forecasting exactly when regional tipping points will be reached, and how these regional climatic dominoes may fall, is extremely difficult to determine — though this study aids in connecting some global climatic dots. What is certain is that we are changing Earth in dangerous ways.  Lenton believes that an expanded market for genuine carbon credits[15] in the Amazon could be the 'ultimate savior' for preserving this vital, yet vulnerable ecosystem.

2023-03-08,Amazon deforestation reduces rainfall in South America,346,"Specialists have been talking for decades about the cause-and-effect relationship between the logging of the Amazon and the reduction of rainfall periods in flow and frequency. When miners, loggers and ranchers cleared the rainforest at record rates, scientists were already warning of the consequences. However, researchers are still learning about the effects that human actions in the forests have on the balance of local and global climate. British scientists provided what they called ""compelling evidence"" about these actions for the first time. They have been able to demonstrate a link between deforestation and declining rainfall in the tropics as a whole. ""Local people living near deforested regions often report a warmer and drier climate after forests are cleared. But until now this effect has not been seen in rainfall observations,"" explained study co-author and project supervising professor Dominick Spracklen from the School of Earth and Environment at the University of Leeds, U.K. ""Our paper shows the critical importance of tropical forests in maintaining rainfall. The study, just published in Nature, established this crucial link by looking at satellite data on deforestation and rainfall in three key tropical forest regions: the Amazon, Congo and Southeast Asia. All of these regions had experienced significant deforestation between 2003 and 2017, the period observed by the scientists. The researchers analyzed rainfall records in both deforested areas and where the forest had remained unlogged. In their analysis, they found that deforested sites were drier, even during the dry season, when every drop of rain counts. In the rainy season, rainfall fell as much as 0.6 millimeters per month for every percentage point of clearing. The study authors also looked at how far the impacts of deforestation would reach, on a scale of 25 to 40,000 square kilometers. In that analysis they found that the effects increased with the greatest amount of land included, with no discernible effects within 10 square miles (16 square kilometers) of deforestation, but with a reduction in monthly precipitation of 0.25 millimeters per percentage point of forest cleared within 25,000 square kilometers. Although the study does not prove that deforestation is causing the decline in precipitation, it provides evidence for a long-standing hypothesis that forest loss reduces precipitation because it means there is less evapotranspiration, the word that describes what happens when water from leaves ascends into the atmosphere. If true, this could have serious consequences for both tropical forests and the people and animals that depend on them. ""Tropical forests play a critical role in the hydrological cycle by helping to maintain local and regional rainfall patterns,"" said the study's lead author and PhD researcher at the University of Leeds, Callum Smith. Reduced rainfall caused by tropical deforestation will affect people living nearby through increased water scarcity and reduced crop yields."" The conclusions of this study are also not good for the forests themselves. ""Loss of precipitation can trigger other deforestation feedback loops, such as increased risk of forest fires, as well as hindering the forests' ability to store carbon and damaging their biodiversity,"" Smith added. The team also analyzed the potential future of Congo's rainforest and found that, if current rates of deforestation persist until 2100, rainfall in the region could decrease by 8 to 10 percent. However, there is a silver lining: the evidence that deforestation leads to local rainfall loss also makes an important short-term case for forest conservation. For every percentage point of rainfall reduced, crop yields can fall by 0.5 percent. Given that agriculture is the driver of nearly 90 percent of global deforestation, these findings may raise doubts among farmers about cutting down trees. ""Demonstrating the local benefit of keeping tropical forests standing for the people who live nearby has important policy implications,"" Smith said. I hope our work will provide a strong incentive for policy and decision makers within tropical nations to conserve tropical forests to help maintain a cooler and wetter local climate, with benefits for agriculture and people nearby,"" he concluded. J. C. A. Baker, another member of the University of Leeds team, also participated in the research.

2023-03-23,Amazon rainforest deforestation is influencing weather in Tibet,347," March 23 -- An international team of climate scientists has found evidence suggesting that deforestation in the Amazon rainforest is influencing weather in Tibet, more than 15,000 kilometers away. In their paper published in the journal Nature Climate Change, the researchers describe possible long-range impacts of deforestation of the Amazon rainforest. Valerie Livina, with the U.K.'s National Physical Laboratory, has published a News & Views piece in the same journal issue outlining the Hopf bifurcation theory and how it relates to climate tipping points and the work done by the team on this new effort.   The Amazon rainforest is considered to represent one of the world's tipping points, where small, gradual changes can eventually lead to a large, sudden, permanent change. As deforestation progresses, it edges ever closer to this tipping point, at which point scientists believe the rainforest cannot be returned to its natural state, even if all of the cutting was stopped and the trees replanted. In this new effort, the researchers note that cutting down the forest has been going on for decades, and climate data has been gathered during the same time period. They wondered what impact the slowly diminishing rainforest might have on distant regions around the globe. To that end, they obtained and analyzed global climate data covering the years 1979 to 2019, looking for associations. They were surprised to find that due to tree loss, warmer temperatures in the Amazon correlated with rising temperatures in Tibet and the West Antarctic ice sheet. They also found that when it rained more in the Amazon, there tended to be less precipitation in both of the other two regions. The researchers were able to trace the route of climate change as the size of the rain forest grew smaller. Its approximate path, they saw, could be charted first to southern Africa, and then on up to the Arabian Peninsula and finally over to Tibet. The trip was found to take just a little over two weeks. This finding, the researchers note, suggests that if a tipping point is reached in the Amazon, it could create a tipping point in Tibet, where temperatures and rainfall would be permanently impacted. They note that prior research has already shown that warming is proceeding faster in Tibet and the Arctic than the global average."
2023-02-24,Amazon/Deforestation: February has worst rate of alerts for the month since 2015,348,"Data from the National Institute for Space Research (Inpe), an agency of the Ministry of Science and Technology, indicate that deforestation alerts in the Legal Amazon identified between February 1 and 17 already represent the worst rate for the month since the beginning of the historical series, which began in 2015. According to information from the Real-Time Deforestation Detection System (Deter), the volume of deforestation reached 209 km2 in the period, compared to 199 km2 verified in the month of February last year. The volume is almost double the area deforested in February 2015, for example, when the system captured 115 km2 of devastation. The Legal Amazon is an area that corresponds to 59% of the Brazilian territory and encompasses the entire eight states - Acre, Amapá, Amazonas, Mato Grosso, Pará, Rondônia, Roraima and Tocantins - and part of the state of Maranhão. In January, the number of deforestation had registered a sharp drop compared to the same month in previous years. There were 167 km2 in January 2023, compared to 430 km2 in January 2022. The specialists point out that factors such as strong rainfall can have an influence on the data, besides the offensives against crimes that devastate the forests. Specialists pointed out that at least four months are needed to evaluate the effect of the actions announced by the government on the forest devastation rates. The Deter system alerts serve as a compass for the deforestation issue, pointing out the most devastated areas and guiding the actions of agencies such as Ibama and the Chico Mendes Biodiversity Institute (ICMBio). Last week, in an interview to Estadão, the new president of Ibama, Rodrigo Agostinho, stated that the government's goal is to halve the deforestation rate verified in the previous year. Agostinho said that Ibama is back in action, after years of paralysis during the Jair Bolsonaro (PL) administration, but it is necessary to recover the structure of the agency, which has been emptied. Ibama once had 2,000 inspectors in the field. Currently, it has less than 350 agents to supervise the entire country. The environmental protection and inspection work, said the new president of Ibama, must count not only on resources from the Union, but also from the Amazon Fund and other agencies that have come knocking on the door of the agency, such as the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and the Global Environment Facility (GEF), one of the largest funders of environmental projects in the world. Ibama informed on Thursday evening that the federal base installed two weeks ago in the Palimiú village, on Yanomami land in Roraima, was the target of an attack. Armed criminals broke through the blockade set up on the Uraricoera River and shot at Ibama agents who had boarded one of the boats. The inspectors fired back. In the shootout, one of the miners was wounded. He was arrested by the Federal Police (PF), for attacking public servants and was hospitalized until Thursday night."
2023-01-20,Ambassador confirms German Prime Minister's visit to Brazil,349,"The German ambassador in Brazil, Heiko Thoms, confirmed on Friday (20) that the Prime Minister of Germany, Olaf Scholz, will visit Brazil on the 30th. The date had already been anticipated by President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, but until this Thursday (19) was not confirmed by German diplomatic sources. ""The German Chancellor has just confirmed that he will come to Brazil on January 30,"" wrote the ambassador on his Twitter account. For Thoms, Scholz's visit, the second by a German official in less than a month, is a ""sign of strengthening cooperation"" between the two countries. As Agência Brasil reported this Thursday (19), the German chancellor will travel accompanied by other ministers and representatives of large German companies. Amazon Fund  An important Brazilian trade partner, Germany has shown interest in a political rapprochement with Brazil, with the possibility of allocating more financial resources to fund environmental preservation projects and actions developed in the country, especially in the Amazon. In early January, when President Frank-Walter Steinmeier came to Brazil to attend the inauguration of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, Germany announced the release of 35 million euros to the Amazon Fund, as compensation for the reduction of deforestation in the Amazon biome in 2017. Created in 2008, the fund receives donations from international institutions and governments to finance actions to prevent and combat deforestation in the Legal Amazon. The resources are used to finance projects for reducing deforestation and monitoring the biome. For political reasons, the mechanism was paralyzed during the Jair Bolsonaro administration. Early last November, the Federal Supreme Court (STF) ordered the Brazilian government to reactivate the fund within 60 days. The measure has been fulfilled under the current administration. On his first day at the helm of the Executive Branch, Lula signed Decree 11.368, authorizing the National Bank for Economic and Social Development (BNDES) to resume raising financial donations for the Amazon Fund. Bilateral relations  Besides the environmental area, Lula and Scholz, who is in fact the political leader in Germany, should also deal with ways to expand commercial relations between the two countries and the growth of the extreme right in several countries. Yesterday, during the GloboNews interview, Lula said that he wants to talk to the German chancellor about how the extreme right is growing in Europe and in the world. On the 9th, the German Prime Minister used Twitter to condemn the invasion and depredation of the Planalto Palace, the National Congress, and the Supreme Federal Court (STF) building that occurred the day before in Brasilia. ""Terrible images come to us from Brazil. The violent attacks against democratic institutions are an attack on democracy that cannot be tolerated. We stand in deep solidarity with President Lula and the Brazilian people,"" wrote the German Social Democrat, who, in addition to Brazil, is expected to visit other countries in the region.

2023-02-28,Analysis: Deforestation has internationalized the Amazon,350,"The visit to Brazil by the special envoy of the Biden administration, John Kerry, to deal with the participation of the United States in the Amazon Fund, coincided with an increase in forest fires. According to data from the National Institute for Space Research (INPE), a record for the period had been registered by February 17. During the meeting with Vice-President Geraldo Alckmin and the Minister of the Environment, Marina Silva, at Itamaraty, Kerry promised to seek ""huge"" resources for the Fund. During President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva's visit to the White House, President Joe Biden had announced this intention. It is estimated that this participation may reach US$ 50 million. According to the US ambassador to Brazil, Elizabeth Bagley, the amount will be defined in a White House negotiation with the US Congress. The Fund was stopped between 2019 and 2022, under the Bolsonaro government. After Lula's inauguration, it was reactivated and its resources released by donors, mainly Norway and Germany. The European Union (EU) also intends to collaborate. The deforestation of the Amazon during the previous government became a threat to the world, which reacts strongly to this. In practice, Bolsonaro has ""internationalized"" the Amazon, whose impact on global warming is enormous, because of the burning and felling of trees. Zero deforestation is the most efficient and cheapest way to reduce global warming and gain time for the conversion to a green economy. For example: the president of France, Emmanuel Macron, announced last Saturday during the International Agricultural Fair in Paris that the agreement between Mercosur and the EU may go through the roof because of the environmental issue. At COP27, in Egypt, Macron doubled down with Lula, then newly elected, with harsh criticism of still-President Bolsonaro. In fact, the warning is mainly directed at Venezuela, which is now also under pressure from its neighbors. Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay are interested in the agreement. France, because of French Guiana, considers itself ""an Amazonian power"". Macron alludes to the Kourou space center, which hosts the European Space Agency's (ESA) rocket and satellite launching base. The venture generates state-of-the-art technology and IT, as well as jobs. Located on the northern coast of South America, like Suriname and the Republic of Guyana, French Guiana is more like a Caribbean territory than a South American one. It is isolated from the rest of the continent by the Amazon rainforest, as it is mainly populated on the Atlantic strip. The French language and the Creole dialect, also present in the Antilles, are not spoken in the South American countries. As it is a French province, it was also excluded from the treaties between the South American countries, but it represents France in the Association of Caribbean States, along with Martinique and the island of Guadeloupe. It is a European enclave in the subcontinent. Illegal mining With 200 thousand inhabitants, a small consumer market and a vulnerable border, French Guiana has remained isolated, but now suffers from illegal immigrants, mainly Brazilian and Peruvian gold miners, Colombian traffickers and Haitian refugees. Brazil has always given more strategic importance to the cooperation with Guyana than France itself, of which it is a department, because the 760km border between the two countries makes us also neighbors. However, the bridge that would connect Guyana to Amapá, the only Brazilian state that has no land connection with the rest of the country, never got off the drawing board. The strategic connection between Manaus and Georgetown, dreamed of by the military in the 1970s, has not been built either. The connection with Suriname, after the construction of the road from Cayenne to Oiapoque, however, became an open door to Colombian traffickers and Brazilian gold miners - in other words, a problem. The borders between Brazil, Guyana, Suriname, Venezuela and Colombia are practically virtual, which puts into question the effective sovereignty between these countries, even more so since the preservation of the Amazon has become a global problem. Several operations have been carried out by the French government to combat illegal mining in French Guiana. However, after each operation the miners returned. On March 12, 2010, French soldiers and border police were attacked while returning from a successful operation during which they arrested 15 miners, confiscated three boats, and seized 617 grams of gold. However, the miners returned to retrieve their lost loot and colleagues. The soldiers fired warning shots and rubber bullets, but the miners managed to retake one of their boats and about 500 grams of gold. Cooperation with France will be fundamental to curb illegal mining and drug trafficking in the Amazon. Coverage by Correio Braziliense Want to stay on top of the main news from Brazil and the world?

2023-01-26,Beyond deforestation: 38% of the Amazon Rainforest is affected by other forms of degradation,351,"In October 2022, the Amazonas government declared that all 62 municipalities in the state were suffering from a drought that left rivers, such as the famous Solimões, full of sandbars, and the population with difficulty navigating and accessing potable water. At that time, 19 cities were considered in a situation of attention, 41 in alert and two in a stage of emergency - the most serious. The recent example, coming from one of the Brazilian states that are part of the Legal Amazon, shows that the threats that surround the forest go far beyond deforestation. This is the alert of a study published this Thursday (26/01) in the scientific journal Science, one of the most important in the world: other forms of degradation that have human interference already destroy a good part of the forest and should be, by 2050, one of the main sources of carbon emissions, regardless of the increase or decrease in deforestation. The study estimates that 38% of the Amazon Rainforest is today affected by some type of degradation: fires; drought (intensified by climate change) selective logging (legal or illegal; ""selective"" because some commercially interesting trees are removed, leaving others standing) and the so-called edge effects (changes in forests near deforested areas, therefore a direct consequence of deforestation). ""The degraded area in the Amazon and the carbon emissions from degradation are equal to or even greater than those from deforestation,"" David Lapola, a researcher at the Center for Meteorological and Climatic Research Applied to Agriculture at the State University of Campinas (Unicamp) and a doctorate from the University of Kassel, Germany, told BBC News Brazil. The research in Science considered the Amazon area both in Brazil and neighboring countries and was based on previous studies and satellite images. The analyzed period ranges from 2001 to 2018. Authored by 35 Brazilian and foreign researchers, the study differentiates between deforestation and degradation. While, in the former, the forest undergoes major changes to make way for a new use - for example, an area that is burned to turn into pasture -, degradation is different because it involves more contained changes in forest cover and does not aim to transform the use of that land. In scientific production, there is another difference: according to the authors, deforestation has received much more attention than degradation. ""In the Amazon Forest, the extent and long-term effects of such anthropogenic disturbances [degradation] on the terrestrial carbon cycle, ecosystem functioning, and the means of survival of local populations are beginning to be understood and differentiated from the impacts of deforestation,"" says an excerpt from the study, which also has the participation, in addition to Unicamp, of researchers from the Institute for Environmental Research in the Amazon (Ipam) and the National Institute for Space Research (Inpe). - This text was published at https://www.bbc.com/portuguese/geral-64395133"
2023-02-27,"Biden is committed to raising funds to help fight deforestation, says Alckmin",352,"Vice President Geraldo Alckmin (PSB) said on Monday (27) that the United States government is ""committed"" to raising ""huge resources"" to help combat deforestation in the Amazon. However, he said that the amount is not yet defined. He gave an interview after meeting with the U.S. government's special envoy for climate, John Kerry, and classified the meeting as ""very fruitful"". ""The envoy John Kerry did not define the amount, but he said that he will work with the government, with the US Congress and with the private sector so that we can have large resources, not only in the Amazon Fund but also in other forms of cooperation"", he said. The minister of the Environment, Marina Silva, and the president of BNDES (National Bank of Social Economic Development), Aloizio Mercadante, responsible for managing the Amazon Fund, also attended the meeting, which took place at the Itamaraty Palace. In early February, President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (PT) paid a visit to US President Joe Biden. At the time, the White House offered about US$ 50 million for environmental cooperation - the amount was considered disappointing by Brazilian negotiators. On Monday (27), Alckmin showed optimism in relation to the donation of values by the USA to help preserve the Amazon and said that the meeting dealt with issues such as decarbonization, energy transition, deforestation and climate change impacts. The vice president, however, said that it was not discussed what counterpart Brazil would have to give to get the transfer from the U.S. government. ""Brazil's commitment was already clear with the presence of president Lula in the meeting with president Biden, a clear commitment from Brazil to be a major player in the fight against climate change,"" he said.

2023-02-24,Brazil: Deforestation in the Amazon set a record for February,353,"Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon set a record for February, the second month of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva's administration, according to official data available on Friday, which contemplates a little more than half of the period, still unfinished. Satellite monitoring detected 209 km2 of destroyed forest in the Brazilian part of the world's largest rainforest, according to preliminary data from the DETER monitoring system of the National Institute for Space Research (INPE). The area, equivalent to more than 29,000 soccer fields, only contemplates data up to February 17, but already represents an increase in relation to the previous record of 199 km2 destroyed in the entire month of February 2022, the last year of the government of the former ultra-right-wing president Jair Bolsonaro. Last January, satellite monitoring had reported a drop of 61% in relation to the same period of 2022, although environmental organizations had warned that it was premature to speak of a ""trend reversal"", since part of the drop could be related to a greater cloud cover that impaired the calculations. ""The increase in deforestation may be a reflection of the limitation in detection last month due to cloud cover, and what is being observed now perhaps contemplates both the area destroyed this month and also from January,"" Daniel Silva, a conservation specialist with the NGO WWF-Brazil, told AFP. Under the Bolsonaro administration, an ally of agribusiness and climate change denier, average annual deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon increased 75.5% over the previous decade. Experts assure that the destruction is mainly due to the advance of farms and land usurpers who clear the jungle for livestock and crops. Lula, 77 years old, assumed the presidency of Brazil for the third time with the protection of the forest as one of his main banners to enable Brazil to stop being a ""pariah"" in climate issues. The leftist president appointed Marina Silva, a renowned environmentalist who headed the Ministry of the Environment between 2003 and 2008, when Brazil managed to significantly reduce deforestation. On January 24, Silva acknowledged in an interview with AFP that Brazil's environmental reality is ""much worse"" than expected. ""We know that there is an effort by the new government to control deforestation, but concrete results will take time to be seen,"" added the WWF-Brazil expert."
2023-01-21,Brazil: Government starts operations to prevent Amazon deforestation,354,"The first tasks to combat deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon began this week, as one of the first measures of the recently inaugurated President of that country, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, informed the Brazilian Institute for the Environment (Ibama). ""The dispatch of the teams to begin inspection operations began on January 16, 2023. The objective is not to compromise the success of these operations"", said the agency, however, they did not specify the place where the tasks will begin. Lula, who returned to power on January 1 for his third presidential term, promised to put an end to deforestation by 2030, in a context in which devastation in the Amazon broke records during the term of his predecessor, Jair Bolsonaro. Deforestation of the Brazilian rainforest shot up by an average of 75.5 percent annually during Bolsonaro's presidency, between 2019 and 2022, AFP news agency reported. In his statements to GloboNews, Lula said he wants to organize a meeting with the Presidents of the Amazon countries: Ecuador, Colombia, Peru, Venezuela, Bolivia and French Guiana, in order to discuss a continental policy for the preservation of the rainforest. / LMPT La entrada Brasil: Gobierno inicia operaciones para evitar deforestación de la Amazonía fue publicada primero en Periódico La Patria."
2023-01-22,Brazil?s new president takes on Amazon deforestation,355,"RIO DE JANEIRO -- Shaking a traditional rattle, Brazil's incoming head of Indigenous affairs recently walked through every corner of the agency's headquarters -- even its coffee room -- as she invoked help from ancestors during a ritual cleansing.  The ritual carried extra meaning for Joenia Wapichana, Brazil's first Indigenous woman to command the agency charged with protecting the Amazon rainforest and its people. Once she is sworn in next month under newly inaugurated President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, Wapichana promises to clean house at an agency that critics say has allowed the Amazon's resources to be exploited at the expense of the environment.  As Wapichana performed the ritual, Indigenous people and government officials enthusiastically chanted ""Yoohoo! Funai is ours!"" -- a reference to the agency she will lead.  Environmentalists, Indigenous people and voters sympathetic to their causes were important to Lula's narrow victory over former President Jair Bolsonaro. Now, Lula is seeking to fulfill campaign pledges he made to them on a wide range of issues, from expanding Indigenous territories to halting a surge in illegal deforestation.  To carry out these goals, Lula is appointing well-known environmentalists and Indigenous people to key positions at Funai and other agencies that Bolsonaro had filled with allies of agribusiness and military officers.  In Lula's previous two terms as president, he had a mixed record on environmental and Indigenous issues. And he is certain to face obstacles from pro-Bolsonaro state governors who still control swaths of the Amazon. But experts say Lula is taking the right first steps.  The federal officials Lula already has named to key posts ""have the national and international prestige to reverse all the environmental destruction that we have suffered over these four years of the Bolsonaro government,"" said George Porto Ferreira, an analyst at Ibama, Brazil's environmental law-enforcement agency.  Bolsonaro's supporters, meanwhile, fear Lula's promise of stronger environmental protections will hurt the economy by reducing the amount of land open for development, and punish people for activities that previously had been allowed. Some supporters with ties to agribusiness have been accused of providing financial and logistical assistance to rioters who earlier this month stormed Brazil's presidential palace, Congress and Supreme Court.  When Bolsonaro was president, he defanged Funai and other agencies responsible for environmental oversight. This enabled deforestation to soar to its highest level since 2006, as developers and miners who took land from Indigenous people faced few consequences.  Between 2019 and 2022, the number of fines handed out for illegal activities in the Amazon declined by 38% compared with the previous four years, according an analysis of Brazilian government data by the Climate Observatory, a network of environmental nonprofit groups.  One of the strongest signs yet of Lula's intentions to reverse these trends was his decision to return Marina Silva to lead the country's environmental ministry. Silva held the job between 2003 and 2008, a period when deforestation declined by 53%. A former rubber-tapper from Acre state, Silva resigned after clashing with government and agribusiness leaders over policies she deemed to be too lenient.  Silva strikes a strong contrast with Bolsonaro's first environment minister, Ricardo Salles, who had never set foot in the Amazon when he took office in 2019 and resigned two years later following allegations that he had facilitated the export of illegally felled timber.  Other measures Lula has taken in support of the Amazon and its people include:  -- Signing a decree that would rejuvenate the most significant international effort to preserve the rainforest -- the Amazon Fund. The fund, which Bolsonaro had gutted, has received more than $1.2 billion, mostly from Norway, to help pay for sustainable development of the Amazon.  -- Revoking a Bolsonaro decree that allowed mining in Indigenous and environmental protection areas.  -- Creating a Ministry of Indigenous Peoples, which will oversee everything from land boundaries to education. This ministry will be led by Sônia Guajajara, the country's first Indigenous woman in such a high government post.  ""It won't be easy to overcome 504 years in only four years. But we are willing to use this moment to promote a take-back of Brazil's spiritual force,"" Guajajara said during her induction ceremony, which was delayed by the damage pro-Bolsonaro rioters caused to the presidential palace.  The Amazon rainforest, which covers an area twice the size of India, acts as a buffer against climate change by absorbing large amounts of carbon dioxide. But Bolsonaro viewed management of the Amazon as an internal affair, causing Brazil's global reputation to take a hit. Lula is trying to undo that damage.  During the UN's climate summit in Egypt in November, Lula pledged to end all deforestation by 2030. and announced his country's intention to host the COP30 climate conference in 2025. Brazil had been scheduled to host the event in 2019, but Bolsonaro canceled it in 2018 right after he was elected  While Lula has ambitious environmental goals, the fight to protect the Amazon faces complex hurdles. For example, getting cooperation from local officials won't be easy.  Six out of nine Amazonian states are run by Bolsonaro allies. Those include Rondonia, where settlers of European descent control local power and have dismantled environmental legislation through the state assembly; and Acre, where a lack of economic opportunities is driving rubber-tappers who had long fought to preserve the rainforest to take up cattle grazing instead.  The Amazon also has been plagued for decades by illegal gold mining, which employs tens of thousands of people in Brazil and other countries, such as Peru and Venezuela. The illegal mining causes mercury contamination of rivers that Indigenous peoples rely upon for fishing and drinking.  ""Its main cause is the state's absence,"" says Gustavo Geiser, a forensics expert with the Federal Police who has worked in the Amazon for over 15 years.  One area where Lula has more control is in designating Indigenous territories, which are the best preserved regions in the Amazon.  Lula is under pressure to create 13 new Indigenous territories, a process that had stalled under Bolsonaro, who kept his promise not to grant ""one more inch"" of land to Indigenous peoples.  A major step will be to expand the size of Uneiuxi, part of one of the most remote and culturally diverse regions of the world that is home to 23 peoples. The process of expanding the boundaries of Uneiuxi started four decades ago, and the only remaining step is a presidential signature, which will increase its size by 37% to 551,000 hectares ( 2,100 square miles). "
2023-03-10,Brazil's Amazon deforestation again hits record high for February,356,"Mar 10, 2023( Al Jazeera English: https://www.aljazeera.com/ Delivered by Newstex)   Deforestation in Brazil's portion of the Amazon rainforest hit a new record high in February, new data has shown, as President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's administration works to end years of widespread devastation.   Satellite monitoring detected 322sq km (124sq miles) of forest cover destroyed in the Brazilian Amazon last month, an increase of 62 percent from the previous record in February 2022, according to data from the national space agency released on Friday.   In the Cerrado, a biodiverse tropical savanna to the south of the Amazon, satellites identified 558sq km (215sq miles) of destruction.   That is up 99 percent from February 2022 and nearly double the previous record of 283sq km (109sq miles) from February 2020, the data showed.   The spike in destruction has underscored the difficulties that Brazil's new president - known as Lula - faces in addressing the rampant deforestation[1] that flourished under his predecessor, Jair Bolsonaro.  The far-right former army captain, who lost a close election run-off to Lula in October of last year, cut environmental enforcement in the Amazon, which environmental and Indigenous groups have blamed for an increase in illegal mining and violence[2].   Bolsonaro's four years in office saw average annual deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon surge[3] by 75 percent compared with the previous decade.   The issue has been of international concern, as the hundreds of billions of carbon-absorbing trees in the Amazon offer a critical buffer in the global fight against climate change.   In November, Lula made a high-profile appearance[4] at the United Nations COP27 climate summit in Egypt, pledging to reassert Brazil's place as an environmental protector and get Amazon deforestation down to zero. 'Brazil is back,' he said.   Lula has taken early action to address the environmental destruction, including rebuilding[5] Brazil's environmental protection agencies, relaunching a defunct national action plan to protect the rainforest and convincing international donors to revive the so-called 'Amazon Fund', which includes more than $580m for anti-deforestation operations.   Following his election victory, Lula also appointed[6] noted environmentalist Marina Silva as the country's minister of environment.  Nevertheless, observers have said reversing the trends will be a slow process.   'It's difficult to reverse the damage of an anti-environmental policy in so little time,' Frederico Machado of the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) Brazil office said in a statement on Friday.   'Reducing deforestation will only happen when there is a consistent strengthening of the institutions responsible for policing it,' he said.   The latest figures came after heartening data[7] from January - Lula's first month in office - showed Amazon deforestation in Brazil had fallen by 61 percent compared with the previous year.   In a presentation last week, a scientist with the space research agency, Inpe, blamed the large month-to-month fluctuations on cloud cover that hid deforestation on satellite images in January, only for it to be revealed in February.   Meanwhile, environment minister Silva last month called the high rate of deforestation shown in early data from February 'a kind of revenge against the actions already being taken'.   She said the level of deforestation was unusual that early in the year, when heavy rains make it difficult for loggers to work in the forest.   'We will keep working towards our goal,' she told reporters.

2023-02-10,Brazil's Amazon deforestation down 61% in January,357,"Brasília: Deforestation in Brazil's Amazon rainforest was down 61 percent in January -- Leftist President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's first month back in the job -- compared with the same period last year, according to an official report published on Friday. Satellite images from the DETER monitoring system showed an area of 167 square kilometers had been destroyed, according to the INPE space research institute. That amounts to the equivalent of 22,000 football pitches, but is a huge decrease on the 430 square kilometers of deforestation in January 2022, when far-right climate change skeptic Jair Bolsonaro was in power. The news came just before Lula was due to meet US President Joe Biden in Washington. Despite the year-over-year drop off in deforestation, the new January figure is still higher than in two of the four years of Bolsonaro's presidency. In 2019 it was 136 square kilometers and just 83 square kilometers in 2021. However, over Bolsonaro's presidency, average annual deforestation increased by 75 percent compared to the previous decade. Bolsonaro instigated policies that favored the agriculture and logging industries, which are mostly responsible for deforestation. Last month's data ""may reflect the resumption of the environmental defense agenda"" that the Lula administration has made a priority, said the Brazilian arm of the World Wildlife Fund (WWF). However, the WWF warned that ""it is too early to talk of a reversal"" of increasing deforestation, not least because it usually peaks in the dry season, beginning in June. ""The action plans for prevention and control of deforestation and forest fires must be restructured as a matter of urgency so that Brazil rediscovers its role as an international environmental leader,"" said Frederico Machado, a conservation specialist at WWF Brazil. He accused Bolsonaro's policies of being ""anti-environmental"" and ""criminal."" Having previously governed Brazil from 2003-10, Lula has promised to rebuild the government agencies tasked with protecting the environment after the severe budget and personnel cuts inflicted on them by Bolsonaro. He has also announced an ambitious goal of zero deforestation by 2030. In order to do so he is counting on international aid, notably through the Amazon Fund, to which Germany and Norway are the main contributors."
2023-01-25,Brazil's new leader works to reverse Amazon deforestation,358,"RIO DE JANEIRO - Shaking a traditional rattle, Brazil's incoming head of Indigenous affairs recently walked through every corner of the agency's headquarters - even its coffee room - as she invoked help from ancestors during a ritual cleansing.  The ritual carried extra meaning for Joenia Wapichana, Brazil's first Indigenous woman to command the agency charged with protecting the Amazon rainforest and its people. Once she is sworn in next month under newly inaugurated President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, Wapichana promises to clean house at an agency that critics say has allowed the Amazon's resources to be exploited at the expense of the environment.  As Wapichana performed the ritual, Indigenous people and government officials enthusiastically chanted ""Yoohoo! Funai is ours!'' - a reference to the agency she will lead.  Environmentalists, Indigenous people and voters sympathetic to their causes were important to Lula's narrow victory over former President Jair Bolsonaro. Now Lula is seeking to fulfill campaign pledges he made to them on a wide range of issues, from expanding Indigenous territories to halting a surge in illegal deforestation.  To carry out these goals, Lula is appointing well-known environmentalists and Indigenous people to key positions at Funai and other agencies that Bolsonaro had filled with allies of agribusiness and military officers.  In Lula's previous two terms as president, he had a mixed record on environmental and Indigenous issues. And he is certain to face obstacles from pro-Bolsonaro state governors who still control swaths of the Amazon. But experts say Lula is taking the right first steps.  The federal officials Lula has already named to key posts ""have the national and international prestige to reverse all the environmental destruction that we have suffered over these four years of the Bolsonaro government,"" said George Porto Ferreira, an analyst at Ibama, Brazil's environmental law-enforcement agency.  Bolsonaro's supporters, meanwhile, fear that Lula's promise of stronger environmental protections will hurt the economy by reducing the amount of land open for development, and punish people for activities that had previously been allowed. Some supporters with ties to agribusiness have been accused of providing financial and logistical assistance to rioters who earlier this month stormed Brazil's presidential palace, Congress and Supreme Court.  When Bolsonaro was president, he defanged Funai and other agencies responsible for environmental oversight. This enabled deforestation to soar to its highest level since 2006, as developers and miners who took land from Indigenous people faced few consequences.  Between 2019 and 2022, the number of fines handed out for illegal activities in the Amazon declined by 38% compared with the previous four years, according an analysis of Brazilian government data by the Climate Observatory, a network of environmental nonprofit groups.  One of the strongest signs yet of Lula's intentions to reverse these trends was his decision to return Marina Silva to lead the country's environmental ministry. Silva formerly held the job between 2003 and 2008, a period when deforestation declined by 53%. A former rubber-tapper from Acre state, Silva resigned after clashing with government and agribusiness leaders over environmental policies she deemed to be too lenient.  Silva strikes a strong contrast with Bolsonaro's first environment minister, Ricardo Salles, who had never set foot in the Amazon when he took office in 2019 and resigned two years later following allegations that he had facilitated the export of illegally felled timber.  • Signing a decree that would rejuvenate the most significant international effort to preserve the rainforest - the Amazon Fund. The fund, which Bolsonaro had gutted, has received more than $1.2 billion, mostly from Norway, to help pay for sustainable development of the Amazon.  • Revoking a Bolsonaro decree that allowed mining in Indigenous and environmental protection areas.  • Creating a Ministry of Indigenous Peoples, which will oversee everything from land boundaries to education. This ministry will be led by Sônia Guajajara, the country's first Indigenous woman in such a high government post.  ""It won't be easy to overcome 504 years in only four years. But we are willing to use this moment to promote a take-back of Brazil's spiritual force,"" Guajajara said during her induction ceremony, which was delayed by the damage pro-Bolsonaro rioters caused to the presidential palace.  The Amazon rainforest, which covers an area twice the size of India, acts as a buffer against climate change by absorbing large amounts of carbon dioxide. But Bolsonaro viewed management of the Amazon as an internal affair, causing Brazil's global reputation to take a hit. Lula is trying to undo that damage.  During the UN's climate summit in Egypt in November, Lula pledged to end all deforestation by 2030 and announced his country's intention to host the COP30 climate conference in 2025. Brazil had been scheduled to host the event in 2019, but Bolsonaro canceled it in 2018 right after he was elected. "
2023-02-10,Brazil Amazon deforestation drops in Lula's first month in office,359,"Feb 10, 2023( Al Jazeera English: https://www.aljazeera.com/ Delivered by Newstex)   Deforestation in Brazil's section of the Amazon rainforest[1] dropped by 61 percent in January, the first month in office for left-wing President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who has promised to relaunch environmental protection efforts.  Preliminary satellite data collected by the government's space research agency Inpe and released on Friday showed 167sq km (64sq miles) cleared in the region last month, down from the 430sq km (166sq miles) lost in January 2022.  But experts cautioned that while the decrease was a good sign, it is still too early to say that the deforestation, which surged under Lula's predecessor[2], far-right Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, has been reversed.  'It is positive to see such a relevant drop in January,' WWF-Brasil conservation specialist Daniel Silva said. 'However, it is still too early to talk about a trend reversal, as part of this drop may be related to greater cloud cover.'  WWF-Brasil also pointed out that deforestation usually peaks in the dry season, beginning in June.  'The action plans for prevention and control of deforestation[3] and forest fires must be restructured as a matter of urgency so that Brazil rediscovers its role as an international environmental leader,' said Frederico Machado, another specialist with the group.  Deforestation increased dramatically[4] under Bolsonaro, who was narrowly defeated by Lula in October elections and had promoted more mining and economic development in Brazil's sprawling Amazon region.  Environmental and Indigenous rights groups had blamed the Bolsonaro administration's policies for the increase in deforestation[5] and illicit activities in the Amazon, including illegal gold mining, as well as an uptick in violence against Indigenous communities in the area.  The new deforestation data came as Lula, who previously served as Brazil's president from 2003 to 2010, was scheduled to meet his United States counterpart[6], President Joe Biden, in Washington, DC, later on Friday.  The two leaders are expected to discuss support for democracy, as well as efforts to fight climate change, among other issues.Lula has promised to get deforestation[7] down to zero in the Amazon rainforest, roughly two-thirds of which lies in Brazil.  On the eve of the talks, the Reuters news agency reported that the US was considering its first contribution to a multilateral fund aimed at fighting Amazon deforestation, with a possible announcement coming during the Biden-Lula meeting.  The Brazilian-administered Amazon Fund, supported mainly by Norway and Germany, was reactivated by environment minister Marina Silva[8] the day she took office last month, after being frozen since 2019 under Bolsonaro.  Charred trunks are seen on a tract of Amazon land burned by loggers and farmers, in Porto Velho, Brazil, August 23, 2019 [File: Ueslei Marcelino/Reuters]  In late January, German development minister Svenja Schulze announced that Berlin would make $38m available for the Amazon Fund, saying Lula's administration[9] offered 'a great chance to protect the forest and to offer a new perspective to the people who live there'.  Germany also pledged to provide $87m in low-interest loans for farmers to restore degraded areas and $34m for Brazilian states in the Amazon region to protect the rainforest.  Yet even with the positive start to the year, experts and staff at Brazil's environmental agency Ibama have warned that it may take years for Lula to deliver on conservation targets after Bolsonaro cut funding and staff at key agencies.  Still, the new Brazilian government has already taken some steps in its push to reverse environmental degradation in the Amazon.  Earlier this week, the authorities launched raids[10] to remove illegal gold miners from Indigenous territories in the region, where they have been blamed for violent attacks and a health crisis affecting the Yanomami people.

NA,Brazil chooses the Amazonian city of Belém for COP30 in 2025,360,"The Brazilian government has chosen the Amazonian city of Belem, capital of the state of Para, to host the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP30) in 2025, the President of Brazil announced Wednesday. ""Itamaraty [Ministry of Foreign Affairs] formalized the city of Belem as the city that is disputing the candidacy to hold COP30 in Belem,"" Lula da Silva said in a video shared on social media. ""I hope we will be there to make a beautiful COP,"" he added. Next door, the governor of the state of Pará, thanked the government for the gesture and stressed that Belem has ""open doors"" to discuss the Amazon, ""discuss the world's climate and find solutions."" Lula da Silva had already expressed his desire to host the climate conference last November during his participation in the COP27 in Egypt, which was his first international trip after winning the October elections against Jair Bolsonaro, who was seeking re-election. On January 1, in his inauguration speech, the Brazilian head of state stated that he ""will not tolerate"" the destruction of the Amazon, whose deforestation rates have skyrocketed during Bolsonaro's four-year administration (2019-2022). According to environmental organizations, deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon has increased by 60% during Bolsonaro's administration compared to the previous four years, when Dilma Rousseff and Michel Temer ruled. Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who will hold the presidency of Brazil until January 04, 2027, has also pledged to end illegal mining and to protect indigenous peoples by providing them with more resources to take care of their lands.

2023-01-06,Brazilian Amazon deforestation up 150% in Bolsonaro's last month,361,"Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon rose 150 percent in December from the previous year, according to government figures released Friday, a final bleak report for far-right ex-president Jair Bolsonaro in his last month in office. Satellite monitoring detected 218.4 square kilometers (84.3 square miles) of forest cover destroyed in Brazil's share of the world's biggest rainforest last month, according to the national space agency's DETER surveillance program. The area -- nearly four times the size of Manhattan -- was up more than 150 percent from the 87.2 square kilometers destroyed in December 2021, according to the agency, INPE. Bolsonaro, who was replaced on January 1 by leftist President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, triggered an international outcry during his four years in office for a surge of fires and clear-cutting in the Amazon, a key resource in the race to curb climate change. Under Bolsonaro, an agribusiness ally, average annual deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon rose by 75.5 percent from the previous decade. ""Bolsonaro's government may be over, but his tragic environmental legacy will still be felt for a long time,"" Marcio Astrini, executive secretary of the Climate Observatory, a coalition of environmental groups, said in a statement. It was the third-worst December on record for the eight-year-old DETER program, after 2017 and 2015. Deforestation in 2022 was also at or near record highs during the crucial dry-season months of August, September and October, when clear-cutting and fires often surge because of drier weather. Experts say the destruction is mainly driven by farms and land grabbers clearing the forest for cattle and crops. Lula presided over a sharp drop in deforestation when he previously led Brazil from 2003 to 2010. He has vowed to reboot Brazil's environmental protection programs, fight for zero deforestation and ensure the South American giant stops being a ""pariah"" on climate issues."
2023-01-23,"Brazilian President Lula Starts Work On Amazon Deforestation, Launches Logging Raids",362,"Jan 23, 2023( Latin Times: http://www.latintimes.com Delivered by Newstex)   Anti-illegal logging raids led by the Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (IBAMA), in Brazil started on Thursday. President Lula da Silva has soughtto fulfilhis many promises to stop the deforestation of the Amazon rainforest and increase the rights and protections of indigenous tribes in the area.  IBAMAenvironmental enforcement coordinator Tatiane Leite said that the agency was launching anti-illegal logging raids in the states of Roraima, Acre, and Para as a sustained effort to reduce the amount of illegal logging being done by loggersand ranchers in the Amazon, according to Climate Home News[1].  Agents and federal police went with reporters to the state of Para, where they found five different areas in the Cachoeira Seca indigenous reserve that appeared to have been burned and deforested around October of last year. Four of them, in the process of being turned into ranches, were reportedly abandoned after Lula was elected President.  Another area was reportedly found with a newly-built house as well as chainsaws, other equipment, and even stocks of food. Agents believed that there were people in that area before they fled just before IBAMA's arrival to escape.  Lula largely was able to win Brazil's presidency on the backs of environmentalists and indigenous people, promising to stop the deforestation of the Amazon and expand the rights and lands of indigenous tribes in the country, the Associated Press[2] reported.  One of the ways he has been able to do so was to appoint individuals from indigenous tribes in high government positions focused on their affairs.Joenia Wapichana was appointed the head of National Indian Foundation or Funai, which carries out the policies for indigenous tribes as well as for the Amazon rainforest.  Beyond that, he is also planning on signing a decree to revitalize the Amazon Fund, which was gutted during the presidency of Jair Bolsonaro. He has also created the new--Ministry of Indigenous Peoples, focused on the welfare and needs of indigenous people in the country.'It won't be easy to overcome 504 years in only four years. But we are willing to use this moment to promote a take-back of Brazil's spiritual force,' Sônia Guajajara, the appointed head of the Ministry of Indigenous Peoples, said.   Representation image.

2023-01-29,"Can intensification of cattle ranching reduce deforestation in the Amazon? Insights from an agent-based social-ecological model (Updated January 29, 2023)",363,"2023 FEB 10 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at NewsRx Science Daily -- According to news reporting based on a preprint abstract, our journalists obtained the following quote sourced from osf.io:  “Deforestation in the Amazon with its vast consequences for the ecosystem and climate is largely related to subsequent land use for cattle ranching.  “In addition to conservation policies, proposals to reduce deforestation include measures to intensify cattle ranching.  “However, the effects of land-use intensification on deforestation are debated in the literature. This paper introduces the abacra model, a stylized agent-based model to study the interplay of deforestation and the intensification of cattle ranching in the Brazilian Amazon. The model combines social learning and ecological processes with market dynamics.  “In the model, agents adopt either an extensive or semi-intensive strategy of cattle ranching based on the success of their neighbors. They earn their income by selling cattle on a stylized market. We present a comprehensive analysis of the model with statistical methods and find that it produces highly non-linear transient outcomes in dependence on key parameters like the rate of social interaction and elasticity of the cattle price. We show that under many environmental and economic conditions, intensification does not reduce deforestation rates and sometimes even has a detrimental effect on deforestation. Anti-deforestation policies incentivizing fast intensification can only lower deforestation rates under conditions in which the local cattle market saturates.”  This preprint has not been peer-reviewed.

2023-02-20,"Cattle Found Responsible For The Deforestation Of The Amazon In Colombia, Says Report",364,"Feb 20, 2023( Latin Times: http://www.latintimes.com Delivered by Newstex)   Cattle-ranching, not cocaine, has driven the destruction of the Colombian Amazon over the last four decades, a new study has found. This is a representational image. Karen Murray/Gettyimages  A recent study states that the deterioration of the Colombian Amazon over the past 40 years has been caused by cattle ranching rather than cocaine.  Research reveals that in 2018, the quantity of forest removed for the cultivation of coca, the main component of cocaine, was just 1/60th of that used for livestock. However, previous administrations have cited environmental concerns to justify stepping up their assault on the green shrub.  The study's conclusions support conservationists who have long argued that Colombia's approach to protecting the Amazon, which is frequently focused on halting coca cultivation, is misplaced, The Guardian[1] reported.  ""We want to finally eradicate this narrative that coca is the driver of deforestation,"" said Pablo Murillo-Sandoval at the University of Tolima, who led the study.  Once the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc) reached a historic peace accord with the government in 2016 and put down their weapons, deforestation spiked.  Land-grabbers profited as rebels came out of the jungle. Deforestation reached a record high of 219,973 hectares (543,565 acres) in 2017, up 23% from the previous year.  Then-president Ivn Duque used the environmental destruction caused by coca cultivation to justify stepping up military action against coca farmers.  Prohibited from spraying coca crops with glyphosate after the chemical was banned in 2015 for health concerns, the Duque government sent in choppers and armed troops into the Amazon rainforest, sometimes into deadly confrontations with coca farmers.  Yet while cattle ranches cleared more than 3m hectares (7.4m acres) of Amazon rainforest in 2018, coca's impact was negligible.  In 2018, the most recent year included in the study, just 45,000 hectares (111,200 acres) were removed for coca.  Murillo and his coworkers were able to distinguish between the activities on a large scale from 1985 to 2019 using a deep learning algorithm to identify between land utilized for coca and livestock.  ""We have always contested the government's argument that coca was driving deforestation but lacked the evidence,"" said Angelica Rojas, liaison officer for Guaviare state at the Foundation for Conservation and Sustainable Development, a Colombian environmental thinktank.  The study adds to the mounting evidence that Colombia's ""war on drugs"" has failed to stop coca production and, in some circumstances, may have even made it worse despite the loss of many lives and the expenditure of billions of dollars.  According to Murillo, farmers who have their crops destroyed simply construct new plots a few kilometers deeper in the forest canopy.  The authors claim that while the government has been playing whack-a-mole with coca producers, the main cause of deforestation, cattle rearing, has been allowed to engulf enormous tracts of land.  Biodiverse tropical rainforests have been incentivized to be turned into desolate fields due to flaws in Colombian land regulations. Landowners must prove that 75% of their plots are productive in order for their deeds to be recognized, and farmers find it much easier to utilize cows than crops, according to Carlos Devia, a forest engineer at Bogota's Javeriana University who was not involved in the study.  ""Ranching is the easiest way to show you're using land, as it's unregulated. You could have 100 hectares of land and just throw 10 cows in there, whereas for potatoes or corn only a hectare would require a year of great work,"" Devia said.  Many times, landless farmers destroy a few hectares of rainforest and illegally sell them to members of criminal gangs who combine several small lots into large expanses of dead, barren pasture.  Colombian President Gustavo Petro, who took office in August last year, is proposing a U-turn on Colombia's failed anti-narcotics strategy.  Petro, a former member of the defunct M-19 rebel group, has turned the focus away from forced coca eradication and is buying up millions of hectares of land to give to farmers.   2023 Latin Times.

2023-02-19,"Cattle, not coca, drive deforestation of the Amazon in Colombia – report",365,"Cattle-ranching, not cocaine, has driven the destruction of the Colombian Amazon over the last four decades, a new study has found. Successive recent governments have used environmental concerns to justify ramping up their war on the green shrub, but the research shows that in 2018 the amount of forest cleared to cultivate coca, the base ingredient of cocaine, was only 1/60th of that used for cattle. The study’s findings vindicate conservation experts who have long argued that Colombia’s strategy to conserve the Amazon – often centered on combating coca production – has been misplaced. “We want to finally eradicate this narrative that coca is the driver of deforestation ,” said Pablo Murillo-Sandoval at the University of Tolima, who led the study. Deforestation spiked after the guerrillas of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc) signed a landmark peace agreement with the government in 2016 and laid down their weapons. As the rebels came out of the jungle, land-grabbers took advantage , clearing trees with chainsaws and burning vast areas. Deforestation reached a record high of 219,973 hectares (543,565 acres) in 2017, up 23% from the previous year. Then president Iván Duque used the environmental destruction caused by coca cultivation to justify stepping up military action against coca farmers. Prohibited from spraying coca crops with glyphosate after the chemical was banned in 2015 for health concerns, the Duque government sent in choppers and armed troops into the Amazon rainforest, sometimes into deadly confrontations with coca farmers. Yet while cattle ranches cleared more than 3m hectares (7.4m acres) of Amazon rainforest in 2018, coca’s impact was negligible. Only 45,000 hectares (111,200 acres) were cleared for coca in 2018, the latest year available in the study. Using a deep learning algorithm to differentiate between land used for coca and cattle, Murillo and his colleagues were for the first time able to distinguish between the activities on a mass scale from 1985 to 2019. “We have always contested the government’s argument that coca was driving deforestation but lacked the evidence,” said Angelica Rojas, liaison officer for Guaviare state at the Foundation for Conservation and Sustainable Development, a Colombian environmental thinktank. “Now we have real data with which we can oppose this mistake.” The figures show that previous governments have used the environment as a false justification to wage war on coca farmers, said Rojas, who was not involved in the study. “They didn’t want to prevent deforestation, they just wanted to justify spending more money and resources on their real political goal: eliminating coca,” she said. The study also adds to evidence that despite lives being sacrificed and billions of dollars being spent, Colombia’s “war on drugs” has failed to halt coca production – and in some cases it may have even made it worse. When farmers have their crops eradicated they simply establish new plots, often just a few kilometres deeper into the forest canopy, Murillo said. “The war on drugs started 40 years ago now, yet everyone knows where coca is: in the same place they have always been.” As the government has engaged in a game of whack-a-mole with coca farmers, the real driver of deforestation, cattle farming, has been allowed to swallow up vast swathes of land, the authors argue. Flaws in Colombian land regulation have incentivised the conversion of biodiverse tropical rainforests into barren pastures. To get their deeds recognised, landowners must demonstrate that 75% of their plots are productive, and it is far easier for farmers to use cows than crops, said Carlos Devia, a forest engineer at Bogotá’s Javeriana University who was not involved in the study. “Ranching is the easiest way to show you’re using land, as it’s unregulated. You could have 100 hectares of land and just throw 10 cows in there, whereas for potatoes or corn only a hectare would require a year of great work,” Devia said. Landless farmers often clear a few hectares of rainforest and sell them illegally to members of criminal organisations who then join up multiple small lots, transforming them into vast swathes of lifeless, arid pasture. Colombian President Gustavo Petro, who took office in August last year, is proposing a U-turn on Colombia’s failed anti-narcotics strategy. Petro, a former member of the defunct M-19 rebel group, has turned the focus away from forced coca eradication, and is buying up millions of hectares of land to give to farmers. “Reducing drug use does not require wars, it needs us all to build a better society,” Petro told the UN general assembly in September last year."
2023-01-31,CCNY Biologist Ana Carnaval Sounds Alarm About Accelerated Deforestation In The Amazon,366,"(TNSjou) -- City College of New York issued the following news: The global climate crisis has altered every ecosystem on planet Earth. In the Amazon, the rate of change is accelerating. The Amazon is home to more than 10% of all named and plant and vertebrate species. It is the core of biogeographic realm that is home to about one-third of all known species. Habitat conversion - driven by logging, forest fires, and canopy clearing, threaten this biodiversity. Global warming, climate variability, and extreme weather events amplify these threats. City College of New York biologist Ana Carnaval along with collaborators from multiple institutions in North America, South America and Europe has determined that these anthropogenic events are pushing the entire Earth System across a critical threshold to a qualitatively different global climate scenario. Their study, entitled: ""Human impacts outpace natural processes in the Amazon,"" appears in the journal ""Science."" Carnaval and her colleagues compared rates of anthropogenic and natural environmental changes in the Amazon to other regions of South America. They then compared these rates with other processes in the larger Earth System. They compiled South America data from the Science Panel for the Amazon (SPA) Assessment Report which details the dimensions of the Amazon as a regional entity of the Earth System and documents Amazonian biodiversity, ecosystem function and cultural diversity. Among other key takeaways, they found the rate at which modern human activity drives extinction in the Neotropics is between 1,000 times and 10,000 times higher than the natural rate as estimated from the fossil record. The Amazon is transitioning from a largely natural to a degraded landscape. After millions of years of serving as a global carbon pool, the Amazon rainforest is poised to become a net carbon source. In some areas, forest respiration and burning are outpacing photosynthesis. Carnaval and her colleagues believe the global community must enhance conservation through legal protections and punish illegal activities for areas under public, private community, and Indigenous management. They call for international financial institutions to suspend funding for mega-infrastructure projects such as roads, bridges, railways, dams and mines in Amazonia pending independent regional environmental assessment. They conclude: ""To fail the Amazon is to fail the biosphere, and we fail to act at our own peril."" * * * JOURNAL: Science https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abo5003 * * * Original text here: https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/news/ccny-biologist-ana-carnaval-sounds-alarm-about-accelerated-deforestation-amazon Contact: Erica Rex, 845/668-0322, erex.ccny.cuny.edu Copyright Targeted News Services MSTRUCK-8056700 MSTRUCK"
2023-04-05,CJ Selecta Accelerates ESG Management to Stop Amazon Deforestation,367,"PR Newswire Completely moving away from purchasing soybeans from the Amazon as part of its Seed Project to preserve the environment  CJ Selecta, the Brazil-based Soy Protein Concentrate (SPC) producer and a subsidiary of South Korea-based CJ CheilJedang, announced on April 5 that it would no longer purchase any soybeans from the Amazon rainforest starting this year. This decision comes just two years after the company declared itself ""deforestation-free"" in 2021, achieving the goal ahead of schedule. Initially, the commitment was set for 2025, but the company managed to accomplish it early on by gradually reducing its soy purchases from the Amazon region. CJ Selecta's Seed Project, launched to replace soybeans sourced from the Amazon, has seen a steady increase in participation, with around 200 farmers currently engaged. The program provides seed and financing to Brazilian farmers outside of the Amazon forest, and commits to purchasing their entire soybean harvest. CJ Selecta has been focused on building a virtuous cycle in which soybeans purchased through the Seed Project can be repurposed after processing. This involves utilizing CJ's fermentation technology to reprocess the byproducts from the processing of the SPC into environmentally-friendly specialty fertilizers and bioethanol. These serve as sustainable alternatives to conventional chemical fertilizers and the gasoline used as fuel for automobiles, respectively. The company aims to reduce its carbon emissions in the entire SPC production. In particular, further cut-down in carbon emissions from inland transportation is expected by shifting its soybean purchases to Minas Gerais, where CJ Selecta is located. CJ Selecta is committed to extending ESG management efforts beyond its own business sites into the wider value chain including its supply chain and partner companies (Scope 3 emissions). At the end of last year, CJ Selecta began supporting farmers in obtaining an international certification from RTRS (Round Table on Responsible Soy Association), a non-profit organization based in Switzerland. RTRS certifies that the soybeans have been produced and transported in an environmentally-responsible manner. This year, the volume of RTRS-certified soybeans is expected to increase by 30 percent from last year, amounting to 60,000 tons. In addition, CJ Selecta has also created an ""agrosatellite"" system that guards against and prevents any intake of soybeans that do not comply with its ESG policy in the purchase of regular soybeans. This system monitors farmland for any potential illegal activities related to soybean cultivation. The Soy Trace app allows customers to also track the entire process of soybean production from harvest to warehouse, ensuring higher transparency and traceability throughout the supply chain. CJ Selecta's commitment to the environment has inspired its global customers to join the effort. Companies such as Unilever and Nestlé have recognized the environmental value of CJ Selecta's deforestation-free soybean oil and pledged their support for environmental protection activities. In fact, CJ Selecta was selected as the winner of the sustainable impact category at the Partner with Purpose Award hosted by the multinational giant Unilever in the UK on March 29. ""CJ Selecta is committed to meeting the growing demand of multinational players for ESG-certified products and to aligning with the environmental policies of Europe, our major export market,"" said Patricia Sugui, ESG manager of the company. ""We will continue to advance our ESG management initiatives to create a circular economy where markets operate in a virtuous cycle that promotes sustainability with eco-friendly products."" CJ Selecta is the number one global producer of SPC based in Brazil. SPC is primarily used as a feed ingredient for aquaculture and is gaining attention as a future replacement for traditional fish meal. CJ Selecta is maintaining its total carbon footprint below one-third of the average for Brazilian soybean processors across its entire value chain from soybean cultivation to SPC production and product delivery to customers. ### About CJ Selecta CJ Selecta, a subsidiary of South Korea-based global food & bio companyCJ CheilJedang, has pioneered the manufacture of soy products for different segments since 1984. Headquartered in Uberlândia (MG), an industrial unit in Araguari (MG), a commercial office in São Paulo (SP) and several branches throughout Brazil.

The initiative was approved last July 14, but the Executive Power observed it, returning it to the Agrarian Commission. The observed document is signed by former President Pedro Castillo and also by the former head of the Council of Ministers, Aníbal Torres. In this sense, they mentioned that this project does not constitute ""an adequate legislation"" that would not protect the Amazon and the national ecosystem. However, the parliamentarians voted in favor of the project, without taking into account the observations made by the former president. Among them was that it ""threatened"" the Amazon. Therefore, it will be debated in the Plenary of the Congress to decide if it will be approved and become law. You may be interested in: Ministry of Environment is against the modification of the Forestry and Wildlife Law. The provision seeks to modify the Forestry and Wildlife Law, precisely in articles 29 and 33. This working group approved it on November 4, 2022.

The entity pointed out that 80% of deforestation is generated by the agricultural sector, so they ask that land be provided to help ""promote this activity"". What was the Executive's observation? The Executive Branch details that this provision will allow the development of agricultural activities without the authorization of the Ministry of Environment. Therefore, they specify that this portfolio is responsible for approving the forest zoning.

2023-02-26,Data shows worst Feb deforestation for Brazil's Amazon,370,"BRASILIA Brazilian Amazon deforestation reached its worst-ever February level in the second month of President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's presidential term, provisional data showed on Friday.  Surveillance satellites had detected 209 sq km of forest destroyed, according to the INPE space research institute's Deter monitoring system.  This is an area equivalent to about 30,000 football fields.  The INPE report included data only up to Feb 17, but there was already an increase from the previous worst February, in 2022, when far-right leader Jair Bolsonaro was still in office.  In January, Amazon deforestation was down 61 per cent from a year earlier, according to the same source.   But experts warned at the time it was premature to talk of a ""reversal"" of the deforestation trend, partly because some forest loss may have been unobserved due to heavy cloud cover.  The February increase may partly reflect forest losses that were unobserved in January, WWF Brazil expert Daniel Silva told AFP.  Over Mr Bolsonaro's presidency, average annual deforestation increased by 75 per cent compared with the previous decade.  Mr Bolsonaro instigated policies that favoured the agriculture and logging industries mostly responsible for deforestation.  Having previously governed Brazil from 2003 to 2010, Mr Lula took office on Jan 1, 2023, with a promise to rebuild the government agencies tasked with protecting the environment after severe budget and personnel cuts inflicted on them by Mr Bolsonaro. He also announced an ambitious goal of zero deforestation by 2030.  In order to do so, he is counting on international aid, notably through the Amazon Fund, to which Germany and Norway are the main contributors. AFP"
2023-01-06,Deforestation in Brazil's Amazon reached record high in last year of Jair Bolsonaro's presidency,371,"The Brazilian Amazon lost 10,267 kilometers of vegetation cover in 2022, an extension equivalent to that of a country like Lebanon. Thus, deforestation of the world's largest rainforest reached a record level in the last year of President Jair Bolsonaro's administration. The area of rainforest in the Brazilian Amazon devastated last year was 24.9% higher than that destroyed in 2021 (8 219 square kilometers) and the largest since the National Institute of Spatial Studies (INPE) began measuring in 2015 the so-called deforestation alerts, reported this January 6, 2023 the official agency. Management against the environment Until now, the year with the highest deforestation was 2019 (9,178 square kilometers), precisely the first of management of the ultra-right leader. Environmentalists blame the current crisis in the Amazon for his anti-environmentalist rhetoric, his defense of mining even in the reserves. In addition to dismantling the oversight agencies. The data disclosed are measured by Dete; a mechanism that uses satellite images to alert monthly and in real time about threatened areas in the Amazon; but they are less accurate than those of Prodes; a tool that INPE uses to calculate deforestation and whose disclosure is annual. According to the latest Prodes bulletin, released in November, the Amazon lost 11 568 km of vegetation between August 2021 and July 2022, 11.3% less than the previous year (13 038 square km) but the second highest in the last 14 years. Record pace Environmental organizations had already warned that the destruction was growing at a record pace in the last months of 2022 in the expectation that Bolsonaro would be defeated in the October presidential election, which ended up happening. Brazil's new president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who took office on January 1, promised that one of his government's priorities will be to return to minimizing deforestation in the Amazon, as he did in his first administration (2003-2010), and to relentlessly combat illegal logging and mining. His Minister of the Environment, the environmentalist Marina Silva, announced the creation of a secretariat within her portfolio dedicated exclusively to combating deforestation. According to INPE data, between August and December 2022 alone, 4,793 kilometers of forest were cleared in the Amazon, a record amount for the period. In December alone, deforestation extended over 218.4 square kilometers, with a jump of 150% compared to the same month of 2021 (87 square kilometers) and the highest number for this month since the beginning of the previous Government. "" Destruction alerts were record in the last months of 2022, which left the Lula Government a rate that will negatively affect the 2023 numbers,"" since the annual measurement is between August of one year and July of the next, said the executive secretary of the Climate Observatory, Marcio Astrini.

In mid-January, Brazilian environmental agents launched their first anti-logging raids under Lula, who has pledged to halt the increase in deforestation under the government of his predecessor, Jair Bolsonaro. Deforestation in January was also below the historical average of 196 square kilometers for the month since 2016, but the January data may have been influenced by dense clouds over the rainforest earlier in the year. ""It is positive to see such a relevant drop in January,"" said WWF-Brazil conservation specialist Daniel Silva. ""However, it is still early to talk about a change in trend, as part of this decline may be related to higher cloud cover."" The new figures come after Reuters exclusively reported on Thursday that the United States was considering its first contribution to a multilateral fund aimed at fighting Amazon deforestation, with a possible announcement during President Joe Biden's meeting with Lula at the White House on Friday. The Amazon Fund, administered by Brazil and supported mainly by Norway and Germany, was reactivated by Environment Minister Marina Silva on the day she took office last month, after having been frozen since 2019 under Bolsonaro. Even with the positive start to the year, experts and staff at environmental agency Ibama warn that it may be years before Lula meets conservation targets after Bolsonaro cut funding and staff at key agencies.

2023-01-06,"Deforestation in the Amazon has 3rd highest mark for the month of December, and the worst of the Bolsonaro administration",377,"The Amazon forest lost 218.41 km² of vegetation in December last year, the last under the management of former President Jair Bolsonaro (PL), in another record of his government. The data are from Deter, a system from Inpe (National Institute for Space Research), which issues alerts to combat deforestation in real time. The record is Bolsonaro's highest mark for the month of December, compared with the same previous periods. If considered the historical series, starting in 2015, it is the third, behind 2017, which recorded 287.51 km², and 2015, which had 266.29 km². The numbers are still to be updated by Inpe, since the information published this Friday (6) goes up to December 30th of last year. In her inauguration speech last Wednesday (4), the Minister of the Environment, Marina Silva, announced the creation of a special secretariat exclusively focused on controlling and combating deforestation. It was during her first term at the Ministry, in the first mandate of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (PT), that the fight against deforestation, with the PPCDAm, reached an 83% reduction in the deforestation rate between 2004 and 2012. Deforestation is monitored in two ways by Inpe. Besides Deter, whose full name is Real-Time Deforestation Detection System, which publishes information monthly, the data from Prodes (Project for Monitoring Deforestation in the Legal Amazon by Satellite) are released twice a year - the first is an estimate. While the Deter was created to enable faster enforcement actions and combat environmental crimes, the Prodes is the deforestation data itself, monitored by satellite and with greater precision. Nevertheless, the Deter can help indicate trends of growth, fall or maintenance of deforestation in the Amazon. Bolsonaro's administration has also accumulated records in Prodes. For the fourth consecutive year, deforestation in the Amazon, in one year, exceeded 10 thousand km². The program's data, released in November last year, show that 11,568 km² of forest were cut down from August 2021 to July 2022. "
2023-01-18,Deforestation in the Amazon has increased for fifth year in a row,378,"Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon has increased for the fifth year in a row and in 2022 was the largest in the last 15 years. Imazon (Amazon Institute of People and the Environment) unveiled on Wednesday that satellite monitoring detected the devastation of 10,573 square kilometers last year, a record since the institution started monitoring the cutting of the forest, in 2008. The loss is equivalent to 3,000 football fields per day. The institute calculates that 35,193 square kilometers of forest have been suppressed between 2019 and 2022. In the period, the increase is 150% in relation to the previous four-year period. From 2015 to 2018, 14,424 square kilometers of forest were cut down. “We hope that this was the last deforestation record reported by our satellite monitoring system since the new administration has promised to give priority to protecting the Amazon,” said Bianca Santos, a researcher at Imazon, in a note. “For this to happen, it is necessary that the government seeks maximum effectiveness in the measures to combat devastation, such as those already announced for the return of the demarcation of indigenous lands, the restructuring of inspection agencies, and incentives to generate income from standing forest.” December was the month of the greatest loss of forest area, 287 square kilometers, 105% more than in December 2021. It was the worst December since Imazon’s records began. “In the last month of the year, there was an unbridled race to deforest while the gate was open for cattle, for land speculation, for illegal mining, and for deforestation in indigenous lands and conservation units. This shows the size of the challenge of the new administration,” said Carlos Souza Jr., coordinator of Imazon’s Amazon monitoring program. The phrase is a reference to former Environment Minister Ricardo Salles, who in a cabinet meeting, in April 2020, said the Covid-19 pandemic was an “opportunity” to ease environmental rules while society’s focus was on the disease. According to Imazon, 80% of the forest cut down in 2022 was concentrated in federal areas, which means 8,443 square kilometers. In this case, deforestation increased by 2% year-over-year. The state areas deforested were equivalent to only 11% of the total, but showed an increase of 11% compared with the previous year, to 1,130 square kilometers. The remaining 9% occurred in areas without jurisdiction (1,000 square kilometers) and municipal areas (0.2 square kilometers). Of the nine states of the Legal Amazon, deforestation was most intense in Pará (3,874 square kilometers, 37% of the total deforested in the country), Amazonas (2,575 square kilometers, 24%), and Mato Grosso (1,604 square kilometers, 15%). The three states are at the top positions in the ranking of deforestation, in that same order, since 2019, according to Imazon. The only states with an increase in deforestation in 2022 compared to 2021 were Amazonas and Mato Grosso. In Amazonas, the increase was 24%. The state has been facing an increase in deforestation in the region bordering Acre and Rondônia, according to Imazon. This is the area of Apuí, the deforestation champion last year, with 586 square kilometers. (Essa publicação é parte integrante do jornal Valor Econômico e se sujeita aos termos de uso do site.)"
2023-04-07,Deforestation in the Amazon has one of its worst first quarters,379,"Deforestation in the Amazon grew again in March, ending one of the worst first quarters ever recorded during the 100 days of the Lula government, according to official figures released on Friday (7). Satellite images detected 356km² of destroyed forest cover in the Brazilian part of the largest tropical forest on the planet. The data shows an increase of 14% compared to that recorded in March 2022, the last of Jair Bolsonaro's administration, according to the DETER surveillance system of the National Institute for Space Research (INPE). Between January and March this year, the destruction of the Brazilian Amazon was the second highest in the historical series for this period, with 844km² deforested, second only to 2022, when 941km² were destroyed. After four years of Bolsonaro's government, which experts say has weakened regulations and environmental protection agencies, improvement in deforestation rates may take time, Mariana Napolitano, conservation manager at NGO WWF Brazil, told AFP. ""The data show that all the dismantling that happened in the last four years, all the discourse in favor of illegality, greater flexibility in relation to command and control shows that it's a complex scenario that exists in this biome and that it takes time to change, even though the current government has demonstrated its intention to combat deforestation very seriously."" Since his election, Lula has promised to reverse the environmental policies of his predecessor and eradicate illegal deforestation. ""It is necessary to recompose these (environmental) agencies and intensively resume command and control actions to see a real change in these tendencies,"" added Mariana. On his first day in office, Lula signed a series of decrees to annul measures harmful to the environment, create a working group to combat deforestation, and reactivate the Amazon Fund, an initiative financed with foreign donations that had been suspended since 2019. Lula also tried to convince the richest countries on the planet to fund initiatives to protect the forest, adding to Norway and Germany's contributions to the Fund, something that has so far yielded little fruit.

2023-01-06,Deforestation in the Amazon increased 150% in Bolsonaro's last month,380,"Deforestation in the Amazon increased by 150% in December compared to the same period in 2021, according to an official report released Friday that comprises the last month in office of former President Jair Bolsonaro. Satellite monitoring detected 218.4 square kilometers of destroyed forest cover last month in the Brazilian part of the world's largest rainforest, according to data from the National Institute for Space Research's (Inpe) Deter satellite surveillance system. The area, almost four times the size of Manhattan Island, increased by 150% from the 87.2 km² deforested in December 2021, according to Inpe. Bolsonaro generated international protests during his four years in office due to a wave of fires and deforestation in the Amazon. Under his government, an agribusiness ally and climate change denier, average annual deforestation in the Amazon increased 75.5 percent over the previous decade. ""The Bolsonaro government is over, but its harmful environmental legacy will still be felt for quite some time,"" pointed out Marcio Astrini, executive secretary of the coalition of environmental groups Climate Observatory. Last December was the third worst month recorded by the Deter program in its eight years of existence, after those of 2017 and 2015. Deforestation in 2022 was also near or at record levels during the dry season months (August, September, and October), when logging and fires usually increase. According to experts, the destruction is mainly due to ranches and landowners who clear the forest for cattle ranching and plantations. In his two previous terms (2003-2010), president Lula achieved a sharp drop in deforestation. He has promised to resume environmental protection programs, to strive for zero deforestation, and to ensure that the country ceases to be a ""pariah"" in climate issues."

World The area, equivalent to more than 29 thousand soccer fields, only contemplates data up to February 17, but already represents an increase in relation to the previous record of 199 km2 destroyed in the entire month of February 2022, the last year of the government of the former ultra-right-wing president Jair Bolsonaro. Last January, satellite monitoring had reported a drop of 61 percent in relation to the same period of 2022, although environmental organizations had warned that it was premature to speak of a ""trend reversal"", since part of the drop could be related to greater cloud cover that impaired the calculations. ""The increase in deforestation may be a reflection of the limitation in detection last month due to cloud cover, and what is being observed now perhaps contemplates both the area destroyed this month and also from January,"" said Daniel Silva, conservation specialist at the NGO WWF-Brazil.

2023-01-08,Deforestation in the Amazon is influencing climate in Tibet,382," Like the Amazon, the Tibetan Plateau could also be approaching a tipping point.Photo: AFP - AFP AgencyDeforestation in the Amazon, a phenomenon that has worried activists and governments in the region, is apparently also having an effect on the climate in regions such as Tibet, more than 15,000 kilometers from the jungle. In a study published in the journal Nature Climate Change, researchers described how the Amazon Rainforest Area (ARA) has ""strong correlations"" with the Tibetan Plateau (TP) and the West Antarctic ice sheet. The models they used to identify the impacts that the transformation of the Amazon is having on other parts of the world allowed them to find associations between rainforest deforestation and rising temperatures in Tibet. ""We found that several climate extremes between the ARA and TP are synchronized under climate change,"" the authors of the new study stated. ( AlsoResearchers analyzed global climate data between 1979, as well as teleconnections between the two regions. ""Teleconnections describe remote connections between components of the complex climate system and reflect the transport of energy or materials on a global scale,"" the study indicates. In that sense, the researchers found a possible propagation path of this teleconnection, which can be divided into three parts: from central South America to southern Africa; from southern Africa to the Middle East; and the last one from the Middle East to the Tibetan Plateau. The length of the route is approximately 20,000 kilometers. Among other findings, they identified that the deforestation phenomenon correlates with rising temperatures in Tibet and the West Antarctic ice sheet. In addition, they found that when it rained more in the Amazon, there tended to be less precipitation in the other two regions. The study also highlights that the extent of the TP snow cover has been losing stability since 2008 and that this may be one of the indicators that this region is increasingly closer to reaching a tipping point. (You may be interested in: Deforestation of the Brazilian Amazon increased 150% in Bolsonaro's last month) This refers to a moment where all changes in an ecosystem (such as deforestation in the Amazon) affect it, changing its characteristics forever, with no possibility of returning it to its initial state. This concept is also known as the ""point of no return"" and has been extensively studied in the case of the Amazon rainforest. The latest Amazonia Viva report warned that ""the processes of deforestation, as well as the degradation of its forests and rivers, are taking the Amazon to a point of no return"". Currently, of the 7 million square kilometers that comprise the Amazon, 18% of the forests have been lost and an additional 17% are degraded. In Brazil alone, which is home to 60 % of the rainforest, more than 1,600,000 hectares were deforested in 2021, 59 % of which corresponded to the Amazon. The researchers warned, then, that it is possible that if this region reaches a tipping point, it could also trigger a tipping point in Tibet . ???? ????

2023-03-08,Deforestation in the Amazon sets a historical record in February,383,"Deforestation in the Amazon set an all-time record in February, according to data from the National Institute for Space Research (Inpe). The number was the highest since the beginning of the historical series in 2015. According to Inpe, between the 1st and 24th of last month, 290.75 km² of Legal Amazon forest were deforested, which is equivalent to the size of the capital city of João Pessoa (Paraíba). The number is 46% higher than in February 2022, when 146.32 km² were deforested. The state that registered the most deforestation was Mato Grosso with around 145 km², followed by Pará (45 km²), Amazonas (42 km²), Roraima (31 km²) and Rondônia (24 km²). The record deforestation was pointed out after a 61% reduction in deforestation rates in January 2023, compared to the same month in 2022. At the end of February, in a meeting at Itamaraty, the Minister of the Environment and Climate Change, Marina Silva, attributed the expansion of deforestation in the Amazon to ""a revenge against measures adopted by the government to combat illicit activities in the region"". She said that ""criminal action has been identified even during the rainy season"" and said that the government will relaunch the plan to combat devastation in the Amazon forest in April."
2023-03-10,Deforestation in the Amazon sets a record and reaches 321.97 km² in February,384,"The National Institute for Space Research (INPE) updated on Friday (10) the data of deforestation alerts in the Legal Amazon in February, confirming the perspective of a record for the month since the beginning of the historical series. The number went from 290.75 km² between the 1st and 24th of last month to 321.97 km² in the month's consolidated data. The area with deforestation alerts grew 62.06% in February, compared to the same month last year, when 198.67 km² were recorded. In the year-to-date, the Legal Amazon accumulates an area of 489 km², ""second largest area deforested in these two months since 2016, the beginning of the historical series - the record occurred in the same period last year (629 km²),"" says the Ministry of Environment. The states that registered the most deforestation alerts in February were Mato Grosso (168.83 km²), Pará (46.46 km²) and Amazonas (46.37 km²). Earlier this week, the ministry decreed an environmental emergency situation for forest fire risk for several regions of the country between April 2023 and February 2024. In mid-February, when the first data for the month came out, the vice-president Geraldo Alckmin (PSB) stated that it was necessary to analyze what had happened for this jump in the number of alerts. The President of the Republic has not yet made any statement about Inpe's update."
2023-02-10,Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon drops 61% in Lula's first month in office,385,"Sao Paulo, Feb. 10. Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon fell by 61.3% in January, the first month of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva's government, compared to the same period in 2022, according to data released Friday. In total, 166.58 square kilometers of forest were destroyed in the month, according to satellite data from the Deter system of the Brazilian Institute for Space Research (INPE). These data are partial, since they do not capture deforestation in areas covered by clouds, and in January 2023, 50.27% of the Brazilian Amazon territory could not be observed for this reason, while in January 2022 this area was 48.04%. The figure was worse than that recorded in January 2021 (82.8 square kilometers) or 2019 (136.1 square kilometers), during the administration of Jair Bolsonaro, who relaxed the fight against deforestation, allowed logging and mining in protected areas and promoted controversial development projects in the region. In a statement, the non-governmental organization WWF positively valued the deforestation data for January 2023, although it said that ""it is still early"" to talk about a reversal of the trend of forest destruction. In 2022, the last year of Bolsonaro's government, the Brazilian Amazon lost 10,267 square kilometers of vegetation cover, a record level since satellite measurements have been taken. President Lula has made the fight against deforestation one of his priorities, with the goal of reducing it to zero by 2030. In his first month in office, Lula reactivated the Amazon Fund, financed by Norway and Germany, revoked Bolsonaro's controversial measures and set up a group with 17 ministries to define policies for the preservation of the rainforest. In Brazil, deforestation is the main cause of the emission of polluting gases into the atmosphere."

Under Bolsonaro's administration, an ally of agribusiness and climate change denier, average annual deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon increased 75.5% over the previous decade. The decrease in the area destroyed could reflect a ""resumption of the environmental defense agenda,"" said the environmental NGO WWF-Brazil in a note, although ""it is premature to speak of a trend reversal."" ""It is necessary to restructure with the utmost urgency the Action Plans for the Prevention and Control of Deforestation and Deforestation and Burning for Brazil to resume its role of environmental leadership on the international scene,"" said Frederico Machado, a WWF-Brazil conservation specialist, who described the recent policy as ""anti-environmental"" and ""criminal"".

2023-01-06,Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon increased 150% in one year,388,"Under the administration of the ultra-right-wing former president, Jair Bolsonaro, the Amazon in Brazil is disappearing faster and faster due to deforestation. A report by the National Institute for Space Research (INPE) revealed that, compared to December 2021, deforestation in a piece of land in the Amazon increased by 150%. Satellite monitoring detected 218.4 square kilometers of forest cover destroyed last month in Brazil's part of the world's largest rainforest, in relation to the 87.2 square kilometers deforested in December 2021. Jair Bolsonaro: the legal proceedings he may face now that he is no longer president of Brazil Under Bolsonaro, an agribusiness ally and climate change denier, the average annual deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon increased 75.5% over the previous decade. Deforestation in 2022 was also at record levels during the dry season months (August, September and October), when logging and fires often increase due to drier weather. These fires provoked a wave of criticism against the former president, who was replaced on January 1 by Lula da Silva, the leftist president who promised to fight deforestation when he takes office. ""There will be no climate security if the Amazon is not protected"", said Lula, who added that all crimes committed against the rainforest in his country, from illegal logging to mining, will be fought ""relentlessly"" at the UN Climate Summit COP27."
NA,NA,389,"End of Document SAO PAULO, Mar 10 (Reuters) - Deforestation in Brazil's Amazon rainforest rose in February to the highest level on record for the month, preliminary official data showed on Friday, highlighting the challenges facing the new government to halt the destruction. President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva took office on Jan. 1 and pledged to end illegal logging after years of rising deforestation under his predecessor, Jair Bolsonaro. Environmental experts and officials have warned that it could take years to significantly reduce deforestation after Bolsonaro cut funds and staff at key agencies. ""We have just left behind a government that supported deforestation,"" Greenpeace Brazil spokesman Romulo Batista said Friday. ""As long as enforcement and control doesn't reach the whole region, illegal deforesters can exploit that to increase this deforestation."" Data from space research agency Inpe showed 322 square kilometers were cleared in the region last month, 62% more than in February 2022 and well above the average of 166 square kilometers for the period. It was also the highest since the Inpe data series began in 2015. But thanks to lower-than-average figures in January, deforestation fell 22% in the first two months of 2023 compared to the same period last year, according to Inpe. In a presentation last week, an Inpe scientist blamed the large month-to-month fluctuations on cloud cover that hid deforestation in satellite images in January, only for it to be revealed in February. Environment Minister Marina Silva said last month, based on partial data from February, that it was unusual to have high deforestation so early in the year, when heavy rains make it difficult for loggers to work in the forest. ""They are deforesting even in the rainy season. It is a kind of revenge against the actions that are already being taken, but we will continue working to achieve our goal,"" Silva told reporters. Load-Date: March 11, 2023"
2023-04-07,Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon increases in the first three months of 2023,390,"Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon increased again in March, closing the first 100 days of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva's government with one of the worst rates on record, in a rise that environmental organizations blame on the environmental deregulation that took place during the four years of Jair Bolsonaro's government. Between January and March of this year, the destruction of the Brazilian Amazon was the second highest in the historical series for that period, with 844 square kilometers destroyed, only below the figure for 2022, when 941 square kilometers were destroyed, according to official figures released Friday by the National Institute for Space Research (INPE). After four years of the pro-Bolsonar government, which, according to experts, has weakened regulations and environmental protection agencies, the improvement in deforestation rates could be delayed, according to the NGO Wildlife Brazil (WWF). ""The data show that there is a complex scenario in the face of the weakening of control in the region and the pro-illegality discourse of recent years,"" explained Mariana Napolitano, conservation manager of the NGO. Reversing deforestation policies Since his election, Lula promised to reverse the environmental policies of his predecessor and eradicate illegal deforestation. ""Although the current government has demonstrated its intention to combat deforestation very seriously, it will take time to change the scenario,"" added the WWF-Brazil expert. On his first day in office, Lula signed a series of decrees to annul measures harmful to the environment, create a task force to combat deforestation and reactivate the Amazon Fund, an initiative financed by foreign donations that had been suspended since 2019. Before taking office, he traveled to the climate summit in Egypt, where he was a special guest, and pledged to fight ""very hard"" against deforestation, while proposing to host the 2025 climate conference."
2023-01-07,Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon reached a record level in Bolsonaro's last year in office,391,"During the government of Jair Bolsonaro, the Brazilian Amazon reached a deforestation record. During his last year in the Planalto Palace alone, 10,267 kilometers of vegetation cover were lost, equivalent to a country like Lebanon. This figure, in turn, shows an increase of 24.9% over the area of forest damaged the previous year, when it was 8,219 square kilometers. Thus, 2022 recorded the highest number since the National Institute of Special Studies (INPE) began measuring so-called deforestation alerts in 2015. Prior to the latest report released, the year with the highest deforestation recorded was 2019, when Bolsonaro became President of Brazil, and 9,178 square kilometers were lost. For these estimates, the agency uses satellite images disseminated by Deter, a mechanism that alerts monthly and in real time about threatened areas in the Amazon. However, its data are less precise than those of Prodes, another tool used by INPE to calculate deforestation each year. Prodes released its latest bulletin in November and reported that, between August 2021 and July 2022, the Amazon lost 11,568 kilometers of vegetation, an extension 11.3% less than that recorded in the same period of the previous year - when it was 13,038 square kilometers. This was, however, the highest in the last 14 years. At the same time, this report informed that only between August and December 2022, 4,793 kilometers of forest were logged there, a record value for the period. In addition, in December alone, deforestation extended over 218.4 square kilometers, which represents a 150% jump compared to the same month in 2021 -when it was only 87 square kilometers-. Again the highest number for this month since the beginning of the previous government. These figures are not surprising since, from the very beginning, Bolsonaro stated that the conservation of the rainforest was not one of his priorities; on the contrary, he decimated the offices in charge of its preservation and defended mining even in the reserves. This caused multiple criticisms from environmental groups, who hold him responsible for the current crisis in the Amazon. These organizations had already warned that in the last months of 2022, the pace of destruction there was accelerating due to the expectation of the president that he would be defeated in the October elections. In view of this delicate context and in order to fulfill one of his main campaign promises, the new president of Brazil, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, assured that one of the priorities of his administration will be to reduce deforestation in the Amazon to a minimum. He also added that he will relentlessly combat illegal logging and mining, which are also major causes of environmental disasters. In this sense, his Minister of the Environment, the environmentalist Marina Silva, moved forward with the creation of a secretariat dedicated exclusively to combating deforestation. On the other hand, the executive secretary of the Climate Observatory, Marcio Astrini, warned that ""the destruction alerts were record in the last months of 2022, which left the Lula government a rate that will negatively affect the numbers of 2023″. And he concluded that ""Bolsonaro's government may be over but his nefarious environmental legacy will be felt for a long time"".

2023-02-24,Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon sets a record for the month of February,392,"Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon set a record for the month of February, the second month of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva's administration, according to official data released on Friday (24), which cover a little more than half of the period, still incomplete. Satellite monitoring has detected 209 km2 of deforestation in the Brazilian part of the world's largest tropical forest, according to preliminary data from the DETER surveillance system of the National Institute for Space Research (INPE). Equivalent to more than 29,000 soccer fields, the area only includes data through February 17, but already represents an increase over the previous record of 199 km2 destroyed over the month of February 2022, the last year of Jair Bolsonaro's government. Last January, satellite monitoring showed a 61% drop from the same period in 2022, although environmental organizations had warned that it was premature to talk about a reversal of the trend, since part of the drop could be related to greater cloud cover that affected calculations. ""The increase in Amazon deforestation in DETER may be a reflection of the limitation in detection last month due to high cloud cover. The deforestation we are observing may then not only contemplate this month's deforestation but also last month's deforestation,"" Daniel Silva, a conservation specialist with the NGO WWF-Brazil, told AFP. Under the Bolsonaro administration, an agribusiness ally and climate change denier, average annual deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon has increased 75.5 percent over the previous decade. Experts say that the destruction is mainly due to the advance of landowners who clear the forest to develop agricultural and cattle ranching activities. Lula, 77 years old, assumed the presidency for the third time with the protection of the forest as one of his main demands so that Brazil stops being a ""pariah"" in climate issues.

2023-03-10,Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon sets historical record in February,393,"Rio de Janeiro, Mar. 10. Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon soared in February by 61.8% compared to the same period in 2022 and even before the end of the month it was already the highest for the period since the measurement began, the government reported Friday. According to data from the deforestation alert system of the National Institute for Space Research (Inpe), 322 square kilometers of native vegetation were devastated last month. In addition to significantly surpassing the 199 square kilometers destroyed in the same month of 2022, this is the highest devastation recorded for a month of February since 2015, when the Government began measuring with the Real-Time Legal Amazon Deforestation Detection System (Deter). The area destroyed in the biome last month was also 93.3% higher than in January, when it lost 166.58 square kilometers. In the first month of the year, deforestation of the largest tropical rainforest on the planet recorded a sharp drop (-61.3%) in the year-on-year comparison and decreased by 27% compared to December. That month, however, experts emphasized that the data were partial, since the dense cloud cover over the biome in January prevented satellites from capturing devastated areas in more than half of the Brazilian Amazon. Thus, it is quite possible that in February the Deter will have recorded the devastation that it failed to capture in January. In 2022, the Brazilian Amazon lost 10,278 square kilometers of vegetation cover, a level never seen before since Deter has been used in Brazil. The deforestation of the biome increased by almost 60% in the four years of Jair Bolsonaro's government (2019-2022) compared to the previous four-year term due to the lack of controls and the weakening of environmental bodies, since the ultra-right-wing leader defends the exploitation of natural resources in the forest, even in indigenous reserves, where it is prohibited by law. The recovery of the Brazilian Amazon is one of the main commitments announced by Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva since he was elected president of the South American giant, a promise he reiterated when he assumed his third mandate on January 1. In his first month in office, Lula reactivated the Amazon Fund, financed by Norway and Germany and in which he also announced that the United States will participate; he revoked controversial measures of Bolsonaro and set up a group with 17 ministries to define policies for the preservation of the rainforest. He also faced a strong fight against the illegal extraction of precious metals in the biome after the health crisis discovered in the Yanomami reserve, caused by the invasion of some 20,000 miners who are still being expelled from the indigenous territory by the authorities. ""We have just come out of a government that supported deforestation. Until oversight and control do not reach the entire territory, illegal deforesters will continue to take advantage to act,"" said Romulo Batista, spokesman for the Amazon for Greenpeace Brazil, attributing the increase in devastation in the first two months to the effects of Bolsonaro's policies.

2023-01-04,Deforestation is wiping out an area larger than the size of Portugal every year,394,"Every year some 10 million hectares of forests are destroyed, an area larger than the size of Portugal and equivalent to that of Iceland, according to the UN, which points to this ""alarming"" global deforestation, along with agriculture and other changes in land use, as responsible for 25% of global emissions of greenhouse gases. According to the latest report from the UN-REDD Programme, the United Nations Environment Programme's World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC) and the Green Gigaton Challenge (GGC) initiative, the world is not on track to achieve the forest goals of ending and reversing deforestation by 2030, a key aspiration for progress towards the Paris Agreement's 1.5°C target. The report concludes that, for the 2030 targets to be achievable, the milestone of one gigatonne equivalent in emissions reversed by forests must be reached by 2025 at the latest. Precisely climate defense in general and reversing deforestation of the Amazon in particular was one of the banners of the campaign that brought to power the new president of Brazil, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who plans to convene a summit this year with the presidents of the eleven countries that share the planet's largest plant lung. His commitment is to reestablish measures to combat deforestation in the Amazon abandoned by his predecessor in office, Jair Bolsonaro, during whose term in office forest destruction increased by almost 60%, with an average area devastated of 11,396 square kilometers per year. Among the causes of deforestation are forest fires, which, in addition to destroying forests and biodiversity, release large amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere. By way of example, in 2022 some 786,000 hectares of forest were burned in the EU, 39% of them in Spain, and 28 million tons of CO2 were released into the atmosphere. Figures similar to those in other parts of the planet in a particularly virulent year: the outbreaks of fires at the beginning of 2022 in the Argentine province of Corrientes, in the northeast, devastated 785,000 hectares, and in Bolivia 854,724 hectares burned only until September. Against this backdrop, the UN believes that limiting the average global temperature increase to 1.5°C will be impossible unless forests play a major role, both in terms of the massive emissions reductions that can be achieved by halting deforestation and the additional carbon that can be sequestered through improved forest management and reforestation. Their calculations indicate that eliminating emissions from deforestation and increasing carbon removals by promoting forest regeneration and landscape restoration could reduce global net emissions by up to 30% and, over the next decade, forests could provide up to 50% of the cost-effective mitigation available. That target is a long way off, however, considering that between about 10 million hectares of forests are destroyed each year, deforestation that is responsible for about 25% of global greenhouse gas emissions along with agriculture and other land-use changes. ""Deforestation and land degradation also undermine efforts to build resilience to climate impacts and threaten forest-dwelling communities,"" the UN laments. Some 70% of tropical forest destruction is generated by the production of agricultural commodities, including palm oil, beef, soybeans, timber, and pulp and paper, says the UN, which says that halting this trend requires decoupling commodity production from deforestation.

2023-01-06,Deforestation of the Brazilian Amazon set a record in Bolsonaro's last year,395,"The area of forest in the Brazilian Amazon devastated last year was 24.9% higher than that destroyed in 2021 (8,219 square kilometers) and the largest since the National Institute of Spatial Studies (INPE) began measuring in 2015 the so-called deforestation alerts, the official agency reported Friday. Until now, the year with the highest deforestation was 2019 (9,178 square kilometers), precisely the first year in office of the far-right leader, whom environmentalists accuse of the current crisis in the Amazon for his anti-environmentalist rhetoric, his defense of mining, and for dismantling oversight agencies. The data released on Friday are measured by Deter, a mechanism that uses satellite images to provide monthly and real-time alerts on threatened areas in the Amazon, but are less precise than those of Prodes, a tool used by INPE to calculate deforestation, which is released annually. According to the latest Prodes bulletin, released in November, the Amazon lost 11,568 kilometers of vegetation between August 2021 and July 2022, an area 11.3% smaller than the previous year (13,038 square kilometers), but the second highest in the last 14 years. Environmental organizations had already warned that the destruction would grow at a record pace in the last months of 2022 in the expectation that Bolsonaro would be defeated in the October presidential elections, which ended up happening. Brazil's new president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who took office on January 1, promised that one of his government's priorities will be to return to minimizing deforestation in the Amazon, as he did in his first administration (2003-2010), and to relentlessly combat illegal logging and mining. His Minister of the Environment, the environmentalist Marina Silva, announced this week the creation of a secretariat within her portfolio dedicated exclusively to combating deforestation. According to INPE data, between August and December 2022 alone, 4,793 kilometers of rainforest were cleared in the Amazon, a record amount for the period. In December alone, deforestation extended over 218.4 square kilometers, with a jump of 150% compared to the same month of 2021 (87 square kilometers) and the highest number for this month since the beginning of the previous Government.

2023-03-21,Emerging Deforestation Frontier In Southwestern Amazon Sees Increase In Burnings,397,"A swathe of the Amazon Rainforest almost twice the size of Luxembourg was destroyed by fire between 2003 and 2019. The area is in the southwest of Amazonas state, in Brazil's North region, and includes parts of nine municipalities with some of the worst sustainable development indicators in the country. Deforestation had been increasing in the area, largely owing to illegal logging and other activities linked to agriculture along two highways that run through it. In the period 2003-19, fire destroyed 4,141 square kilometers (km²) of forest, of which 3,999 km² was primary (native) vegetation. A year-by-year breakdown shows that the area affected by fire ranged from a low of 33 km² in 2011 to a high of 681 km² in 2019. In addition, 6,484 km² of pasture and crops burned down in the period. These numbers are from an article published in the journal Fire reporting a study by scientists at the National Disaster Surveillance and Early Warning Center (CEMADEN) and the National Space Research Institute (INPE), both of which are Brazilian institutions, in partnership with colleagues at universities and other research institutions in Brazil and abroad. According to the article, which focuses on Boca do Acre, a municipality in Amazonas state, loss of vegetation due to deforestation increased the occurrence of burned areas, resulting in transformation of the landscape from forest to cropland and pastureland, especially in the vicinity of highways BR-317 and BR-364. Factors such as intensification of the dry season and more frequent extreme weather events also made the region susceptible to anthropogenic (human-induced) fire. Moreover, the accumulation of organic matter from deforested areas fueled ongoing fires, which spread as a result. On the other hand, protected areas such as conservation units and Indigenous territories acted as a barrier against deforestation. Fire destroyed only 189.13 km², or 1.3% of the total, in the period 2003-19, mainly near roads and farms in the Boca do Acre and Apurinã Indigenous Territories. ""Our study identified the extent and frequency of fires, and the correlations with changes in land cover and climate, pointing to priority areas for conservation. We also analyzed the susceptibility to fire of forest on undesignated public land and adjacent to rural properties. This is troubling. More recent deforestation is increasingly close to protected areas, which thereby become even more vulnerable,"" said Débora Dutra, first author of the article. She is an environmental and sanitary engineer and a researcher at CEMADEN, with a scholarship from FAPESP. Undesignated land is government land that has not been assigned to a specific use, such conservation or settlement. This category is the most vulnerable to encroachment by land grabbers and squatters. For Liana Anderson, also a researcher at CEMADEN and supervisor of Dutra's master's research, in addition to its detailed analysis of fire patterns in the area, the study also evidenced how fire is advancing through the Amazon Rainforest. ""The region is known as the new deforestation frontier,"" she said. ""A first wave devoured the forest from Mato Grosso [a state in Brazil's Center-West region], and the fires then moved on up into Amazonas state. This area is under pressure, but conservation units and Indigenous territories have served as barriers, emphasizing their importance to maintenance of the forest and its socio-biodiversity."""
2023-01-01,Environment: transition to a low-carbon economy is a priority,398,"The resumption of the leading role in the international agenda on climate, forests, biodiversity, indigenous peoples and traditional populations, water, Amazon, ocean, clean energy and decarbonization of production chains is among the priorities in relation to the environmental area of the government of President-elect Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who takes office next Sunday (1). The information is part of the transition cabinet's final report released after the closing of the activities developed by the thematic groups. The Ministry of Environment will be headed by Marina Silva.   Former senator, Marina Silva becomes Environment Minister again - Reproduction/YouTube The new government has among its goals the transition to a low-carbon economy, still unregulated in the country. The strategy is aimed at containing greenhouse gas emissions and has been gaining more and more space around the world .  Related News: New government will have as a challenge to recompose education budget. Vaccination coverage and reduction of health queues are challenges of the government. ""The transition to a low carbon economy is understood as a competitive advantage for the country, which is able to generate business, products and services with lower carbon emissions, besides offering solutions for the needs of mitigation and adaptation to climate change. Our challenge is to rebuild the dismantling of institutions and to reconnect the country with its future as an environmental power"", points out the document. According to the survey, Jair Bolsonaro's government ""has promoted a deliberate and illegal dismantling of public policies, regulatory frameworks, spaces for control and social participation, and public agencies and institutions linked to the preservation of forests, biodiversity, genetic heritage, and the climate and environmental agenda. To reverse this scenario, the transition team proposes the repeal of several ""extremely serious"" normative acts that have already been the object of lawsuits in the Federal Supreme Court (STF).  Logs of wood in a sawmill yard near the municipality of Colniza, northwest Mato Grosso - Marcelo Camargo/Archive Agência Brasil ""  The Green Package, analyzed by the STF, is made up of seven lawsuits in which acts of the Bolsonaro government are analyzed that led to to the destructuring of Brazilian environmental legislation, to the weakening of the inspection and combat of environmental crimes and crimes related to indigenous peoples, to the unprotection of the environment as a whole and especially the Amazon biome,"" says the report. The suggested repeals have, among their objectives, that of controlling deforestation, resuming the Action Plan for Prevention and Control of Deforestation in the Legal Amazon (PPCDAM) which, according to the transition group, is one of the ""main instruments capable of controlling deforestation, contributing to the reduction of gas emissions. The report also proposes an end to impunity by revoking ""decrees that annulled environmental fines, paralyzed the environmental inspection system, and created an environment of persecution of inspectors. The estimated loss with the annulment of these fines is over R$ 18 billion in resources for the public coffers, according to surveys presented in the report. Still within the scope of environmental protection, proposals were presented for the total revocation of the decree that allows illegal mining in the Amazon (10.966/2022); the resumption of the Amazon Fund; and the structuring of the National Environmental Council (Conama). Deforestation Degraded area in the municipality of Colniza, northwest Mato Grosso - Marcelo Camargo/Archive Agência Brasil According to the survey, the deforestation rates in the Amazon and Cerrado reached peaks never seen 15 years ago. ""There was a 60% increase in deforestation in the Amazon during the Bolsonaro administration, the highest percentage increase that has ever occurred in a presidential term, since satellite measurements began in 1988,"" the report says. Another point highlighted in the document in relation to the environment concerns the impact caused by the imposition of barriers to Brazilian products in international trade, the restriction of access to credit, the loss of credibility of Brazil before the rest of the world, in addition to the compromise of national sovereignty in relation to the Amazon.  Children play in the São Lourenço riverside community - Marcelo Camargo/Archive Agência Brasil ""  Traditional communities and peoples have been persecuted or forgotten, in total ignorance of their importance for the protection of Brazilian biodiversity and the attraction of international funding and donations focused on environmental and social sustainability,"" adds the document . Staff The survey prepared by the transition team also warns about the reduction and equipping of the staff of the Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (Ibama), Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation (ICMBio), Brazilian Forest System (SFB) and the Ministry of Environment (MMA) itself. Currently, these agencies have 2,103 vacant positions. ""While Ibama had 1,800 public servants working in environmental inspection in 2008, now there are only about 700, not all of them in the field. There has been effective staffing and occupation of managerial and directorial positions without the technical and political capacity to act in the area of environmental protection and management.

2023-01-19,Exclusive-First Brazil Logging Raids Under Lula Aim To Curb Amazon Deforestation,400,"Jan 19, 2023( International Business Times News: https://www.ibtimes.com/ Delivered by Newstex)   Brazil's first raids against illegal deforestation in the Amazon rainforest under President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva were underway on Thursday, after the new leader's pledge to end destruction that surged under his predecessor Jair Bolsonaro.  Reuters exclusively accompanied raids led by environmental agency Ibama in the rainforest state of Para to stop loggers and ranchers illegally clearing the forest. The agency has also launched raids this week in the states of Roraima and Acre, Ibama environmental enforcement coordinator Tatiane Leite said.  About 10 Ibama agents set out in pickup trucks on Thursday from their base in the municipality of Uruara, Para, along with a dozen federal police, heading toward an indigenous reserve where satellite images showed loggers and ranchers recently at work clearing the forest illegally. The mission aims to stop or scare off loggers to avoid further incursions into the forest and to issue fines to those caught with illegal wood.  The Bolsonaro government had gutted staff and funding for environmental enforcement by Ibama in his four years in office, while the former president criticized the agency for issuing fines to farmers and miners.  Bolsonaro gave the military and later the Justice Ministry authority over operations to fight deforestation, sidelining Ibama despite the agency's extensive experience and success in fighting the destruction of the Amazon.  An area larger than Denmark was deforested under Bolsonaro, a 60% increase from the prior four years.  Lula on the campaign trail last year pledged to put Ibama back in charge of combating deforestation with beefed-up funding and personnel. He took office on Jan. 1, so additional money and staff have yet to reach the front-line enforcers. But Ibama agents told Reuters that they already felt more empowered by Lula announcing environmental protection as a top priority.  Bolsonaro's government denied several requests by Reuters to accompany Ibama missions during his 2019-2022 administration. His government instituted a gag order forbidding Ibama agents from speaking to the press, which agents say has already been reversed under Lula.  ""Publicizing raids to dissuade environmental criminals is already a big change. That didn't happen in the previous government, whose goal was to show that we weren't doing anything,"" said Givanildo dos Santos Lima, the agent leading Ibama's Uruara mission.  Lula took office for the first time in 2003 when Amazon deforestation was near all-time highs, and through strict enforcement of environmental laws reduced it by 72% to a near record low when he left office in 2010.

2023-02-24,February forecast indicates record deforestation in the Amazon,401,"SAO PAULO, 24 FEB (ANSA) - The Institute for Space Research (Inpe) released the partial data of deforestation alerts in the Legal Amazon in February and the numbers already show a record for the month since the beginning of the historical series, in 2015. According to the document released on Friday (24), there are 209km² of destroyed area until the 17th of February.  For comparison, the record for the second month of the year was 2022, when, during the 28 days, 199km² were deforested. The total figures for February will be released on March 3rd.  The alerts are produced by the Real-Time Deforestation Detection System (Deter), which includes daily data on devastation in areas larger than three hectares, and encompass the entire Legal Amazon, a region that involves nine states (Acre, Amapá, Amazonas, Mato Grosso, Pará, Rondônia, Roraima, and Tocantins) and part of Maranhão.  Inpe's weekly report also indicates that the state that has deforested the most is Mato Grosso, with 129km², followed by Pará (34km²) and Amazonas (23km²).  The numbers released on Friday contrast with data from January, when deforestation alerts fell 61% compared to the same month last year (167 km²). (ANSA). "
2023-04-07,Fines for deforestation in the Amazon increase 219% in the 1st quarter,402," The number of fines for deforestation and other infractions in the Amazon region, in the first quarter of 2023, increased 219%, if compared to the average for the same period of the years 2019 to 2022. The data are from the Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (Ibama).  Added to the fines are the seizures of goods and products related to environmental violations, which rose 133%, and the number of embargoes of properties, which grew 93% in the same period. Ibama points out that these measures decapitalize the violators and prevent them from obtaining bank loans, besides restricting the trade of illegal products.  If only the operations carried out against the invaders of the Yanomami indigenous territory, located in the states of Amazonas and Roraima, are observed, from February 6 to date, Ibama has destroyed 285 miners' camps, eight aircrafts, 23 boats, three tractors, and 124 engines. Also seized were 21 thousand liters of fuel, 22 tons of cassiterite ore, 5 kg of mercury, among other logistical support equipment for illegal mining.  Throughout Brazil, the institute's environmental fines increased 78% from January to March this year, in relation to the same period of the previous four years.  Ibama justifies that the increases in fines, seizures of goods and products, and embargoes of properties occurred due to the resumption of the powers of the environmental agency of the federal government and the command of the environmental area to combat deforestation.

So far, the operation has resulted in the destruction of 285 miners' camps, 8 aircraft, 23 boats, 3 tractors and 124 engines. Also seized were 22 tons of cassiterite, 21 thousand liters of fuel and 5 kg of mercury, among other mining support equipment.

2023-02-27,French Bank BNP Paribas Sued by NGOs Over Amazon Rainforest Deforestation Link,404,"Environmental and human rights activist groups said on Monday they had sued BNP Paribas, the eurozone's biggest bank, for providing financial services to companies they allege contribute to the deforestation of the Amazon rainforest. Brazilian NGO Comissão Pastoral da Terra and French group Notre Affaire À Tous said they filed the lawsuit last week with the Paris judicial court, alleging BNP Paribas did not carry out proper checks before agreeing to finance such companies. Paris-based BNP Paribas said in statement sent to Reuters that it required its clients to have a ""zero deforestation"" strategy in their production and supply chains by 2025. Update: Activists Sue BNP Over Energy Loans, TotalEnergies Over Human Rights Forest destruction is Brazil's largest source of greenhouse gas emissions and climate campaigners are increasingly using lawsuits to push big companies to shift to a low-carbon economy. French companies have become a particular focus because of a 2017 French law that places the onus on them to identify and prevent risks to human rights and the environment that could occur as a result of their business activities. The case is the second to target BNP Paribas on these grounds, following another complaint filed last week. The first ruling by a French court based on the law is due on Tuesday in a case against oil major TotalEnergies BNP Paribas said it required ""full traceability"" from its clients regarding their supply chains of beef and soy from the Brazilian Amazon and Cerrado. It pledged to no longer provide financial products or services to those that do not agree to. ""Only a collective commitment by financial institutions can be fully effective,"" BNP Paribas said. ""Simply ceasing to finance these actors would have no positive impact on their practices, as they would continue to rely on a largely sufficient number of lenders for their activity,"" it added.

2023-03-22,General Norwegian Minister says Brazil has returned to environmental leadership,405," The Norwegian Minister of Climate and Environment, Espen Barth Eide, said on Wednesday (22) that Brazil is resuming the global leadership it once had, when it comes to environmental issues. The statement was made during his meeting with the Minister of Environment and Climate Change, Marina Silva. The two ministers released a joint statement in which they reaffirmed the bilateral partnership on climate and forests, which began in 2008, with the launch of the Amazon Fund, by Brazil, and the International Climate and Forest Initiative (NICFI), by Norway. ""Through the bilateral Memorandum of Understanding of 2008, Norway supported the Amazon Fund, which became the model for several other bilateral partnerships. In the following years, Brazil continued to achieve a remarkable reduction of deforestation in the Amazon and presented one of the most important climate mitigation results in the world,"" the MMA said in a statement. Global leadershipBarth Eide told the Brazilian minister that ""Brazil has shown global leadership in the past and is doing so again now. Still according to the Norwegian, the international community must spare no efforts to mobilize all available tools and resources to partner with the Brazilian government. He reinforced that Norway is ""deeply committed to remaining a close and long-term partner of Brazil"". Both Barth Eide and Marina Silva advocated a ""rapid operationalization of the resources available in the Amazon Fund to support the critical needs identified by Brazil to reduce deforestation and promote sustainable and inclusive development in the Amazon Region"". The Norwegian minister said that his country will support Brazil in mobilizing additional resources for the Amazon Fund, as well as to increase cooperation, investments and public and private financing. ""In this context, both authorities committed themselves to exchange views on how best to take advantage of opportunities emerging from different approaches, including results-based payments and jurisdictional carbon markets,"" the MMA reported.

2023-01-20,Germany's Prime Minister confirms visit to Lula in January,406,"The German ambassador in Brazil, Heiko Thoms, confirmed this Friday, 20, that the prime minister of Germany, Olaf Scholz, will visit Brazil next 30 days. The date had already been anticipated by President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, but, until yesterday, was not confirmed by German diplomatic sources. ""The chancellor of Germany has just confirmed his coming to Brazil on January 30,"" wrote the ambassador on his Twitter account. For Thoms, Scholz's visit, the second by a German official in less than a month, is a ""sign of strengthening cooperation"" between the two countries. As Agência Brasil reported yesterday, 19, the German chancellor will travel accompanied by other ministers and representatives of large German companies. An important Brazilian trade partner, Germany has shown interest in a political rapprochement with Brazil, with the possibility of allocating more financial resources to fund projects and environmental preservation actions developed in the country, especially in the Amazon. In early January, when President Frank-Walter Steinmeier came to Brazil to attend the inauguration of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, Germany announced the release of 35 million euros to the Amazon Fund, as compensation for the reduction of deforestation in the Amazon biome in 2017. Created in 2008, the fund receives donations from international institutions and governments to finance actions to prevent and combat deforestation in the Legal Amazon. The resources are used to finance projects for reducing deforestation and monitoring the biome. For political reasons, the mechanism was paralyzed during the Jair Bolsonaro administration. Early last November, the Federal Supreme Court (STF) ordered the Brazilian government to reactivate the fund within 60 days. The measure has been fulfilled under the current administration. On his first day at the helm of the Executive Branch, Lula signed Decree 11,368, authorizing the National Bank for Economic and Social Development (BNDES) to resume raising financial donations for the Amazon Fund. Besides the environmental area, Lula and Scholz, who is in fact the political leader in Germany, should also deal with ways to expand trade relations between the two countries and the growth of the extreme right in several countries. Yesterday, during the GloboNews interview, Lula said that he wants to talk to the German chancellor about how the extreme right is growing in Europe and in the world. On the last day 9, the German Prime Minister used Twitter to condemn the invasion and depredation of the Planalto Palace, the National Congress and the Supreme Court building (STF), which occurred the day before in Brasilia. ""Terrible images come to us from Brazil. The violent attacks against democratic institutions are an attack on democracy that cannot be tolerated. We stand in deep solidarity with President Lula and the Brazilian people,"" wrote the German Social Democrat, who, in addition to Brazil, is expected to visit other countries in the region.

2023-04-04,Google Earth now shows deforestation in the Amazon until 2022,407,"Google announced on Tuesday (4) that Google Earth now includes images of the advance of deforestation in the Amazon until 2022. Updating the platform with data from 2020 makes it possible to track the advance of forest destruction, which had record rates in the Jair Bolsonaro administration. The technology giant also announced the launch of an early detection system for fires, in partnership with Inpe (National Institute for Space Research), and the expansion of alerts for floods, in collaboration with the Geological Survey of Brazil (CPRM). The announcements were made at the event Sustainability with Google - Amazon, which is taking place in Belém (PA). With satellite image records since 1984, Google Earth has a timelapse tool that now shows in detail the changes in forest cover over the last two years (click here to see examples on Google Earth). The engine used to generate the images, Google Earth Engine, is already used by researchers to monitor the use of natural resources, as in the case of the Mapbiomas platform. The project was created in 2019 and conducts annual mapping of land use and surface water, as well as monthly monitoring of fire scars. See in the videos below timelapses showing deforestation advance: ""This kind of historical series is also useful for local communities to draw attention to their issues,"" points out Rebecca Moore, director of Google's geospatial initiatives. One of the first people to use the tool was the Surui paiter. ""Technology today is very important for us, indigenous peoples, not only in the protection of territories, but also to take our cosmology and our understanding of the world to other places that think that only their world exists,"" says activist Txai Surui, a columnist for Folha de São Paulo newspaper. She also says that looking back at the forest helps to show that the fight to keep the Amazon standing is collective and that the answers for this lie in traditional knowledge. ""If there is a future, it is ancestral."" The history of searches on the site shows the increase in interest in environmental topics. In the last ten years, searches on Google for the term ""Amazon"", for example, rose more than 80% in Brazil. Worldwide, the increase was more than 40%. Furthermore, ""weather"" and ""climate"" are among the ten most searched words in the country since the beginning of the historical series, in 2004. Nubia Quilombola, an educator from Amapa explains that the mapping done by Google Earth made it possible to pinpoint exactly where the gaps and conflicts are. ""We were able to show: here there is a lack of school, here quilombola died [in dispute] for land, for example."" ""We took the Federal University of Amapá to teach preparatory courses for teachers and researchers to combat environmental racism,"" he says. ""Only then did we realize how the lack of will from the public power excludes our people from the Amazon."" For the new fire detection system, artificial intelligence will be used to identify fire outbreaks in early stages by means of satellite images. Early firefighting makes it easier to contain the fires, avoiding the release of large amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere. The project is still in the initial phase of model development, and there is no timetable for it to go into effect. The flood alerts, which have been operating in Brazil since 2022, have been expanded to include 27 cities. The system issues warnings in real time on the search page and on Google Maps when heavy rains deserve the population's attention. The forecast is that the network will be expanded to 20 more cities in the first half of 2023. The reporter traveled to Belém at Google's invitation."
2023-01-31,Halting deforestation in the Amazon and the cerrado could generate a gain of R$ 1.2 trillion,408,"Halting deforestation in the Amazon and the cerrado by 2030, as Brazil proposes to do, may generate a gain of up to US$ 240 billion (R$ 1.2 trillion) for the global GDP (Gross Domestic Product). The calculations are made by Bráulio Borges, researcher at FGV Ibre (Brazilian Institute of Economics, Getulio Vargas Foundation) and senior economist at LCA Consultores, and take into account both the increase in greenhouse gas emissions due to burning and the reduction of the forest, which reduces carbon absorption. He states that it follows the logic of the CSC (Social Cost of Carbon). The calculation involves estimating the impacts caused by climate change, such as damage to human health and the environment, and the costs to remedy them. A lower global warming, for example, would mean from less spending on energy for air conditioning to a lower rise in the level of the oceans (which can devalue properties in coastal regions and even destroy them) or greater agricultural productivity and labor (in the latter case, because of the impacts on human health). According to the economist, the drop in deforestation during the first two governments of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (PT) and the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions provided, in current values, a gain of US$ 818 billion (R$ 4.2 trillion) for the world economy between 2003 and 2011, compared to a scenario in which the results of 2002 were maintained. On the other hand, the increase in deforestation and its consequences in the increase of greenhouse gas emissions from 2019 to 2022, already during the government of former president Jair Bolsonaro (PL), led to an estimated loss of US$ 201 billion (about R$ 1.02 trillion, in comparison with the trend in 2008 and with the estimate for last year). Bráulio used net emissions data from Seeg (System of Estimates of Emissions and Removals of Greenhouse Gases), from the Climate Observatory, and from Inpe (National Institute for Space Research) for deforestation. To estimate the costs, the so-called CSC (Carbon Social Cost) was used per additional ton of CO2 (carbonic gas) discharged into the atmosphere - from US$ 185 per ton in 2020 and reaching US$ 226 in 2030. Considering a linear reduction path, as of 2027, the biomes would leave the level of losses and start generating gains for the world economy, which add up to US$ 240 billion. With zero deforestation in both biomes in 2030, the capture of GHGs by the forests would be greater than the gross emissions from deforestation and fires, explains the researcher. He reminds that it is also necessary to consider that the gains are diluted in time - that is, they will not necessarily materialize fully between 2027 and 2030 - and if deforestation remains zero after 2031, the accumulated gain will grow. ""These gains and losses affect the world economy over many years, since greenhouse gases have effects for centuries, and the gains and losses are diluted over time. About five years ago it was a utopia, but today it is clear how Brazil can monetize preservation, through the carbon credit market,"" says Borges. In November last year, still as the elected president, Lula stressed in a speech at the COP 27 (climate conference), in Egypt, that the fight against climate change would be a priority during the four years of his government. ""There is no climate security for the world without a protected Amazon, and we will not measure our efforts to zero deforestation and degradation of our biomes by 2030, just as more than 130 countries committed to do when they signed the Glasgow Declaration on Forests,"" said the president-elect. ""We will prioritize the fight against deforestation in all our biomes. During the first three years [of the Bolsonaro government], deforestation in the Amazon had an increase of 73%, this devastation will be in the past,"" he concluded. Borges evaluates that the shift in the environmental policy, with Bolsonaro's defeat in 2022, coincides with the advance in the discussions about environmental preservation, which Brazil may lead in the coming years. In this scenario, the prominence that the Minister of the Environment, Marina Silva, has received and her presence at the World Economic Forum in Davos (Switzerland), lends the country a very positive reputation around the world, assesses the economist. ""We are already back with the Amazon Fund, we are back with the plan to combat deforestation and we are already recomposing budgets and ministry teams. Brazil has ambitious commitments in relation to being an economically prosperous, socially just, politically democratic, culturally diverse and environmentally sustainable country,"" said Marina in Davos. ""But we need to go for it, some results will need to be delivered soon and it will be necessary to stipulate bolder goals and a plan to fulfill these rules,"" says Borges, who highlights opportunities in the expansion of the electricity sector through wind and solar energy and the definition of emission standards. With the shift in environmental policy, Brazil can also benefit in the coming years from the attraction of capital through investors who take into account environmental preservation. In addition, the country can avoid sanctions on Brazilian products and unlock the agreement between Mercosur and the European Union, as already signaled by European leaders. ""And we can earn royalties to keep the forest standing and earn to reforest. The carbon credit market is becoming more and more global. If Brazil reduces deforestation to zero, it will have a surplus in relation to the targets and will be able to export this to other countries to meet theirs"", says Borges. The researcher adds that, although the effects of deforestation can be more clearly captured by economists - such as the increase in cattle breeding in the states of the Legal Amazon or the extraction of illegal timber - there are costs that deforestation generates that are more difficult to capture, such as the reduction of rainfall in the Center-West and even in the Southeast and South. IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO RESUME THE AGENDA, THE GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO MOVE FORWARD In the evaluation of specialists heard by Folha, the Lula government begins with the challenge of resuming the environmental policies that made Brazil a reference in international forums in past decades, but it needs to advance in the forest protection strategy. ""It is necessary to have a sustainable development project for the region allied to the goal of reducing deforestation. The Amazon is not being cut down to make way for high quality agricultural production: almost two thirds is pasture with very low productivity, 10% is agricultural production, and one fifth is secondary vegetation [abandoned areas]"", says PUC-Rio economist Clarissa Gandour. In his new mandate, Lula will need to resume what had worked well before and invest in points that have not had so much progress, such as the axes of sustainable development and territorial planning, she says. ""It is necessary to deal with the issue of land vacancy, areas that are not registered and that do not have a defined function. Little progress has also been made on the issue of illegal land occupation. Without changing the territorial order, there won't be zero deforestation"", says Gandour, who is coordinator of Public Policy Evaluation focused on Conservation at CPI (Climate Policy Initiative). The researcher remembers that it is also necessary to look at the agrarian reform settlements, which represent almost one fifth of what was deforested; it is an issue full of nuances, because it deals with families that need to survive and guarantee the viability of their lands. Brazil can be synonymous of superpower of biodiversity, in the environmental area it has indicators that developed countries don't have. It's a champion of biodiversity, but it has a hard time accepting this idea, assesses Carlos Eduardo Young, from UFRJ (Federal University of Rio de Janeiro). ""The speech by [vice-president and Minister of Development, Industry, Commerce and Services] Geraldo Alckmin, of installing a green economy secretariat, and of having a specific green economy directorate within the BNDES, expand the discussion beyond the Ministry of the Environment. I am happy to see that we now have a different conjuncture. The professor points out that the dependence that Brazil has created on export revenues from agribusiness and mineral resources will still have strong political weight for the next few years, and it is necessary to consider the challenges for environmental preservation in this context. ""But now there will actually be a debate and it is necessary that the country has the perception that it is much better for us to grow through activities that generate environmental conservation and well-being for the population."""
2023-03-27,Historic! Pucallpa Declaration in favor of forest conservation is signed,409,"Ucayali. In order to promote the value of standing forests and stop the deforestation of the Amazon forests, four ministers - the heads of Environment, Agrarian Development and Irrigation, Culture, Justice and Human Rights - together with the ambassadors of Germany, Norway, United Kingdom and the United States, as well as the members of the Amazon Regional Commonwealth signed today the Declaration of Pucallpa. This document expresses the joint work of the State against deforestation within the framework of national policies and recognizes the role of indigenous peoples in the conservation of standing forests, as part of the actions included in the National Strategy for Climate Change to 2050. In this regard, the Minister of the Environment, Albina Ruiz, highlighted the commitment of the State and the countries that are part of the Joint Declaration of Intent (JIU), thus strengthening climate action and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions generated by deforestation and forest degradation, as well as the promotion of sustainable development. It should be noted that the Joint Declaration of Intent (JIU) is a voluntary cooperation agreement signed by the governments of Peru, Norway, the United Kingdom and Germany to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to the design and implementation of public policies. Usaid participates as an observer. Sustainable actions in UcayaliPreviously, the Minister of Environment, accompanied by the Minister of Culture, Leslie Urteaga, toured the agricultural cooperative Colpa de Loros and the Association of Women Chocolate Makers of Nolberth del Alto Uruya, together with the regional governors of Ucayali, Manuel Gambini, and of Huánuco, Antonio Pulgar. Also present at the event were the German ambassador, Sabine Bloch; the United Kingdom ambassador, Gavin Cook; the Norwegian ambassador, Jostein Leiro; and the United States ambassador, Lisa Kenna, who agreed that this type of initiative should be replicated in other parts of the country in order to combat illicit activities.

2023-01-20,Ibama conducts the first operations of the Lula administration against deforestation in the Amazon,410,"Brazilian environmental agents cut through the forest with machetes on Thursday (19) in search of criminals in the first anti-deforestation operations of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (PT), who has vowed to stop the increasing destruction inherited from his predecessor, Jair Bolsonaro (PL). Reuters followed exclusively the raids led by Ibama (Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources) in the Amazon rainforest in the state of Pará to stop loggers and ranchers from illegally cutting down the forest. Ibama also launched raids this week in the states of Roraima and Acre, said the environmental enforcement coordinator, Tatiane Leite. About ten Ibama agents set off in pickup trucks Thursday from their base in the municipality of Uruará in Pará, along with a dozen federal police officers, toward a cluster of points where satellite images showed loggers and ranchers recently working on illegal logging. In 12 hours of driving along dirt roads that illegally cut through an indigenous reserve, the convoy reached five areas that were deforested and burned at the time of last October's election, which pitted Lula against Bolsonaro. All the areas are within the Cachoeira Seca Indigenous Land, where deforestation is strictly prohibited. Four of the tracts appeared to have been subsequently abandoned, with no signs of people living nearby or in the process of turning them into farms. Agents said it could be a sign that illegal ranchers have given up investing time and money to turn illegal land into productive pastures, knowing that Lula campaigned on a promise to crack down on deforestation. ""People know that in this government the inspection will be stricter and will not allow them to use an area that they illegally deforested,"" said Givanildo dos Santos Lima, an agent leading Ibama's mission in Uruara. ""If the other government had won, you would have found people here, well-manicured pastures and cattle."" Bolsonaro's government had cut staff and funds for environmental enforcement at Ibama in his four years in office, while the former president criticized the body for issuing fines to ranchers and miners. Bolsonaro gave the military and then the Justice Ministry authority over operations to combat deforestation, sidelining Ibama, despite the agency's vast experience and success in combating the destruction of the Amazon. An area larger than Denmark has been deforested under Bolsonaro, a 60% increase over the previous four years. In another area of the reserve, agents found a newly built house with several chainsaws and food stockpiled for weeks, indicating that the occupants had likely fled shortly before Ibama arrived. Flanked by police officers with semi-automatic weapons, the environmental agents made their way through the surrounding jungle to reach an area the size of 57 soccer fields filled with downed trees and piled up logs. Some wildly planted corn stalks were knee-high in what appeared to be an attempt to claim the area and then turn it into cattle pasture, the agents said. ""We're going to come back with a helicopter and take them by surprise,"" Lima said. He was optimistic that Ibama will be able to carry out more raids in Lula's government, with the aim of fining deforesters and preventing criminals from trying to clear more areas. In last year's election campaign, Lula promised to put Ibama back in charge of fighting deforestation, with increased funding and personnel. He took office on January 1, so additional money and staff have yet to reach the inspectors on the front lines. The Bolsonaro administration has denied several requests by Reuters to monitor Ibama missions during his administration in 2019-2022. His administration instituted an injunction prohibiting Ibama agents from talking to the press, which officials say has already been revoked. Lula first took office in 2003, when Amazon deforestation was near an all-time high, and through strict enforcement of environmental laws reduced it by 72 percent to a near-record level when he left office in 2010."
2023-01-18,"In 2022, the Amazon had the highest deforestation in 15 years, says Imazon",411,"Deforestation in the Amazon set a new record in 2022, year in which the vegetation cover of the forest lost 10,573 km², equivalent to almost 3 thousand soccer fields, according to a report released today (18) by the Institute of Man and Environment of the Amazon (Imazon). By satellite monitoring, 2022, which reached its highest level since 2008, when Imazon started monitoring the Amazon Region. Related news: In the last 4 years, forest loss in the Amazon was 35,193 km², according to Imazon. The area exceeds those of states like Sergipe (21 thousand km²) and Alagoas (27 thousand km²). The period coincides with the mandate of former president Jair Bolsonaro, who used to discredit data on deforestation. The government of president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has promised to give priority to the issue. The Minister of the Environment, Marina Silva, has been making statements about the preservation of the forest. In one of the first measures, the Amazon Fund was unblocked, which counts on donations from Germany and Norway to be applied in environmental protection actions. ""We hope that this was the last deforestation record reported by our satellite monitoring system, since the new government has promised to give priority to protecting the Amazon,"" said researcher Bianca Santos, from Imazon, in the material released on Wednesday (18). The institute highlighted the jump in deforestation recorded in December, a month in which 287 km² of forest were cut down, an increase of 150% compared to the same month in 2021 (140 km²) and the worst last month of the year of any historical series. ""In the last month of the year there was an unbridled race to deforest while the gate was open for the cattle, for land speculation, for illegal mining and deforestation in indigenous lands and conservation units. This shows the size of the challenge of the new government"", said Carlos Souza Jr, Amazon monitoring coordinator at the institute, in the publicity material. Around 80% of the area deforested in 2022 is in lands under the responsibility of the federal government (8,443 km²). Another 11% of destroyed territory is under the jurisdiction of state governments (1,130 km²). Also according to the report, the state that deforested the most in 2022 was Pará (3089 km²), followed by Amazonas (2270 km²) and Mato Grosso (1228 km²). All the information about the Amazon deforestation monitoring report can be found at the Imazon portal."
2023-02-24,"In two weeks, deforestation in the Amazon already sets a record for February",412,"In just over two weeks, deforestation in the Amazon has already broken the record for the month of February since the beginning of the historical series in 2015. Until the 17th, 208.7 km² of forest were lost, an area equivalent to the city of João Pessoa (211 km²). The alerts were released on Friday (24) by Deter, Inpe system (National Institute for Space Research) that gathers information to combat deforestation in real time. The data referring to the total for the month of February should be released in two weeks. Until then, the highest deforestation figure for February had been registered last year, with 198.6 km² of lost forest. Considering the partial data, most of the destruction in the month is concentrated in Mato Grosso (129.4 km²), followed by Pará (33.9 km²) and Amazonas (23.1 km²). The beginning of the year is rainy in the region, which hinders the clearing of vegetation and leads to lower numbers of deforestation, in comparison with other seasons. The current record comes after a 61% drop that had been registered in January, in comparison with 2022. At the time, specialists pondered that, even though it was good news, the reduction should be seen with caution, since the month had had high cloud cover in the region, which makes monitoring by satellite images difficult. Due to the way it is prepared and predicts this type of variation, the Deter data is used to analyze trends, which are consolidated every three months. In other words, the numbers that will give a more solid diagnosis about the beginning of this year should only come out at the end of the first quarter. Since the beginning of 2023, the Deter has already indicated 375.3 km² deforested in the Amazon. These are the first figures of the new government of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (PT), which has been concentrating its actions in the Amazon region on fighting the humanitarian crisis of the Yanomami and illegal mining. On the 15th, the Ministry of Justice and Public Safety announced a program to expand security actions in the Amazon. Named Safer Amazon, the program aims to combat actions such as illegal mining and deforestation. The Planeta em Transe project is supported by the Open Society Foundations."
2023-01-10,Jair Bolsonaro left the government setting a record for Amazon deforestation,413,"With his presidency over, the traces of Jair Bolsonaro's passage through the leadership of Brazil's destinies continue to show their traces, not only in the economy and in the brutal increase of social exclusion, but also in the destruction of the environment. According to an official report covering last December, the last month that the ultra-right-winger was in power, deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon increased 150% in December in relation to the same period of 2021. Satellite monitoring detected 218.4 square kilometers of forest cover destroyed last month in Brazil's part of the world's largest rainforest, according to data from the DETER satellite monitoring system of the National Institute for Space Research (INPE). The area, nearly four times the size of Manhattan, increased 150% over the 87.2 square kilometers deforested in December 2021, according to INPE. Bolsonaro, who was replaced on January 1 by leftist President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, provoked international protests during his four years in office over a wave of fires and logging in the Amazon, a key resource in the international race to curb climate change. Under Bolsonaro, an agribusiness ally and climate change denier, the average annual deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon increased 75.5% over the previous decade. ""Bolsonaro's government may be over, but his nefarious environmental legacy will be felt for a long time,"" Marcio Astrini, executive secretary of the Climate Observatory, a coalition of environmental groups, said in a statement. Last December was the third worst recorded by the DETER program in its eight years of existence, after 2017 and 2015. Deforestation in 2022 was also near or at record levels during the dry season months (August, September and October), when logging and fires often increase due to drier weather. Experts say the destruction is mainly due to farms and land grabbers who clear the forest for cattle and crops. Lula, 77, who already governed the country between 2003 and 2010, promised to restart environmental protection programs, fight for zero deforestation and ensure that the Latin American giant is no longer a ""pariah"" on climate issues. The hard facts Under Bolsonaro's government, the Amazon has suffered the worst deforestation since 2006, but 2022 has been catastrophic. The PlenaMata Forest Monitor, which does satellite monitoring and research by multiple organizations, notes that about 461,312,570 trees have been deforested, an average of 1,221 trees per minute, during 2022. With Bolsonaro's arrival in 2019, the figure almost doubled: from 4,953 square kilometers in 2018 to 9,177 in 2019. ""The rate of deforestation in indigenous territories is rising sharply, with an increase of 74% between 2018 and 2019,"" noted Global Witness, following the first year of the Bolsonaro government. Indigenous communities have been constantly threatened and attacked by state policies. The Atlas of Environmental Justice, which documents social conflicts around environmental issues, points out that 174 cases of environmental conflicts have been reported in Brazil, in which around 150 are active. According to WWF, because of Jair Bolsonaro's policies, by 2021 Brazil would suffer the ""worst water crisis in 90 years due to the combined effect of meteorological factors with the increasing deforestation of the Amazon."" Impunity and lack of justice has also been denounced in multiple investigations. Amnesty International launched in 2021 a report entitled ""1,000 days without rights. The violations of the Bolsonaro government"", in which it denounces multiple aggressions to human rights. Among them, it denounces the omissions of Bolsonaro's government in the face of the fires of 2019 and 2020 that destroyed large areas of the Amazon; his anti-indigenous speeches and agenda; and the constant attacks on journalists. Human RightsWatch has also indicated that ""Bolsonaro's government has weakened the enforcement of environmental laws and, in practice, given a green light to criminal networks that drive illegal deforestation of the Amazon and intimidate and attack forest defenders. The number of homicides by police officers reached a record high, disproportionately affecting black Brazilians."" Persecution of environmentalists The news of the murder of indigenous rights defender Bruno Araujo Pereira and English journalist Dom Phillips in June last year went around the world. However, it is not the only case of murders of environmental leaders. Brazil is among the most dangerous countries for environmental defenders. According to information from the Global Witness organization, which documents the murders of environmental leaders, 342 defenders have been killed in Brazil since 2012 (26 in 2021, 20 in 2020 and 24 in 2019). The situation during 2022 was no better. This organization points out that ""Since Bolsonaro came to power, he has encouraged illegal logging and mining, overturned the protection of indigenous territorial rights, attacked conservation groups, and dismantled and cut the budgets and resources of forest and indigenous protection agencies. This has led criminal gangs to invade indigenous and conservation areas with impunity."""
2023-02-10,Legal Amazon: deforestation drops 61% in January,414,"The aggregate area of deforestation in theLegal Amazon in January was 167 square kilometers, a reduction of 61% compared to the same month last year, when it reached 430 square kilometers. The preliminary data were released this Friday (10) by the National Institute for Space Research (Inpe), based on alerts made by the Real-Time Deforestation Detection System (Deter). With an area of 5 million square kilometers, which corresponds to 59% of the Brazilian territory, the Legal Amazon is formed by the states of Acre, Amapá, Amazonas, Mato Grosso, Pará, Rondônia, Roraima, Tocantins and part of Maranhão. The Deter is a rapid alert survey of evidence of changes in forest cover in the Amazon, done by Inpe. According to the institute, ""the system supports the supervision and control of deforestation and forest degradation carried out by the Brazilian Institute for the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (Ibama) and other agencies linked to this issue. The Deter captures only part of the changes that have occurred, due to the lower resolution of the images/sensors used and also the restrictions of cloud cover. Therefore, the data can be revised. The reference base for measuring deforestation in the country is carried out by Prodes (Project and Monitoring of Deforestation in the Legal Amazon by Satellite), whose database is considered more reliable, with a level of accuracy of close to 95%. Currently, three systems monitor the Legal Amazon, each with a different function. In addition to Prodes and Deter, Inpe also uses the Selective Exploitation Detection System (Detex)."
2023-02-25,Lula fails to halt deforestation of the Brazilian Amazon. It is a new (and sad) record,415,"Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon set another record in February, about two months after President Lula da Silva took office, according to official data released. The satellite monitoring system detected 209 square kilometers destroyed in the Brazilian part of the world's largest rainforest, according to preliminary data from the National Institute for Space Research (INPE) system. The area, equivalent to more than 29,000 soccer fields, includes only data compiled through February 17, but was already higher than the previous record of 199 square kilometers destroyed in the entire month of February 2022, the last year of former President Jair Bolsonaro's government. Satellite monitoring had recorded a 61% drop in January compared to the same period in 2022. But environmental organizations had warned that it was premature to speak of a ""trend reversal"" as observations may have been hampered by increased cloud cover. Under the Bolsonaro administration average annual deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon jumped 75.5% during the previous decade. This destruction is mainly due to farmers wanting to increase their land for crops and cattle, activities that Jair Bolsonaro has always encouraged. Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, 77, was sworn in as President of Brazil in early January - for the third time - making forest protection one of his priorities. Marina Silva, a renowned environmentalist, was chosen to head the Ministry of Environment, having already been responsible for this portfolio between 2003 and 2008, when Brazil managed to considerably reduce deforestation."
2023-01-01,Lula reinstates Amazon Fund and revokes Bolsonaro's pro-garimpo decree,416,"On his first day in office, President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (PT) issued a series of decrees that interfere in environmental policy. The set reestablishes the Amazon Fund, opens the way for restructuring the Conama (National Council for the Environment) and revokes the decision that relaxed the laws for combating illegal mining. The measures were announced during the solemn session at which the ministers of the new government took office and were later announced by the transition team. Lula fulfilled the promise made during the campaign and signed a decree that reestablishes the control bodies of the Amazon Fund. Under Ricardo Salles, the Ministry of the Environment extinguished the council that managed the fund, which caused its donors, such as Norway, to freeze transfers to the instrument. Soon after the election of the President of Brazil, the country, however, had already affirmed that it would return to finance the fund. Now, the Amazon Fund should see the release of the R$ 3.3 billion to which it is already entitled and should also start receiving new transfers - according to the governor of Pará, Helder Barbalho, of more than R$ 5 billion. Lula also revoked Bolsonaro's decree that created the so-called Pró-Mape program, which aimed to stimulate ""artisanal mining"" - in practice, a boost to illegal mining on indigenous lands and environmental protection areas. At the time, the General Secretariat of the Presidency said that the program inaugurated ""a new perspective of public policies on mining activity in Brazil."" Finally, the president determined, through an order, that the minister of Environment and Climate Change, Marina Silva (Rede), has 45 days to prepare a proposal to restructure the Conama (National Council for the Environment). The council was emptied by former president Jair Bolsonaro (PL) in 2019, when he excluded civil society members from its participation. Since then, the Supreme Court (STF) was triggered by the case and formed a majority to overturn reverse measure, but in practice, nothing has happened. Lula is still to sign a decree that reestablishes the PPCDAm (Action Plan for Prevention and Control of Deforestation in the Legal Amazon). The measure had already been announced by Minister Marina Silva on her first day after being appointed to head the portfolio. According to the transition team, a decree will also be published ""that reestablishes the combat against deforestation in the Amazon, in the cerrado and in all the Brazilian biomes, recovering Ibama's protagonism"".

NA,NA,417,"End of Document Rio de Janeiro (AP) - Shaking a traditional rattle, Brazil's new head of indigenous affairs recently walked through every corner of the agency's headquarters, including the coffee room, as she invoked the help of the ancestors during a ritual cleansing. The ritual had extra meaning for Joenia Wapichana, Brazil's first indigenous woman to head the agency charged with protecting the Amazon rainforest and its people. Once she is sworn in next month under the administration of new President Luiz Inácio da Silva, Wapichana promises to clean house at an agency that critics say has allowed the Amazon's resources to be exploited at the expense of the environment. As Wapichana performed the ritual, indigenous people and officials enthusiastically chanted ""Yoohoo! Funai is ours!"" a reference to the agency she will head. Environmentalists, indigenous peoples and voters sympathetic to their causes were important to Lula's narrow victory over former president Jair Bolsonaro. Now Lula seeks to fulfill campaign promises he made on a wide range of issues, from expanding indigenous territories to halting the rise of illegal deforestation. To carry out these goals, Lula is appointing well-known environmentalists and indigenous people to key positions in Funai and other agencies that Bolsonaro filled with agribusiness allies and military chiefs. In his first two terms, Lula had a mixed record on environmental and indigenous issues. And he will surely face obstacles from Bolsonaro-sympathetic state governors who still control swaths of the Amazon. But experts say Lula is taking the right first steps. Meanwhile, Bolsonaro's supporters fear that Lula's promise of stricter environmental protections will hurt the economy by reducing the amount of land open for development and punish people for activities that were previously allowed. Some in agribusiness have been accused of providing financial and logistical assistance to protesters who earlier this month stormed the presidential palace, Congress and the Supreme Federal Court. When Bolsonaro was president, he stripped Funai and other agencies responsible for environmental oversight. This allowed deforestation to soar to its highest level since 2006, as developers and miners who took land from indigenous peoples faced few consequences. ____ The Associated Press' climate and environmental coverage is supported by several private foundations.

2023-03-15,Lula's challenges replace initial optimism with government in foreign press,418,"After a first positive reaction from the foreign press regarding the election of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (PT) to the presidency and the inauguration of his government at the end of 2022 and the beginning of this year, the foreign perception begins to show signs of attention on problems faced by the new administration of Brazil, in power for two months. In a period of low visibility, there has not been just one subject that has concentrated the attention of the international press. Reports published last week, however, indicate the persistence of political, environmental and economic difficulties in Brazil, as well as challenges to be faced by the government. In total, in the second week of March 37 texts with mention to Brazil were registered in the seven vehicles analyzed - a volume well below the weekly average of the International Interest Index (iii-Brazil), which is almost double the last collection. Most texts had a neutral tone (57%), while the volume of positive mentions was 17% and the percentage of texts with a negative tone was 27%. One of the main highlights about Brazil in the international press was a report with a balance of the first two months of the new government in the French newspaper Le Monde, registering ""the difficult first steps of Lula"". ""At the head of a shaken country, the leftist president maintained an intense agenda and benefited from an established form of union (...) but also raised disappointments and initial criticism,"" the text states. Similarly, the environmental issue continues to have a strong influence on the external perception of Brazil. Instead of the optimism generated by Lula's victory, there are signs that the government is demanding action. One of them was a report in the British newspaper The Guardian about the rise of deforestation in the country. ""Deforestation in Brazil's Amazon rainforest increased in February to the highest level ever recorded for the month, highlighting the scale of the challenge facing Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva's government as it tries to undo the environmental destruction caused by far-right former president Jair Bolsonaro,"" the report said. The same newspaper and the Portuguese newspaper Público also gave space to denunciations about deforestation in Brazil from the demand for collagen products in the rest of the world. An investigation ""found that cattle raised on farms that cause deforestation were processed in slaughterhouses that serve international collagen supply chains,"" says the English newspaper. Environmental challenges got attention also in the New York Times, which published a review of journalist Eliane Brum's book on the Amazon, including criticism of the current government. ""Under President Jair Bolsonaro, deforestation in the Amazon has increased by about 60%. His leftist successor, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, promised when he took office in January to reverse this devastation; but, as Brum notes, it was he who gave the green light to Belo Monte during his previous administration, 'eloquent proof that every ideological hue sees the Amazon as a body to be dominated and exploited,'"" she says. As a slightly more positive counterpoint, the Spanish newspaper El País published two reports on important issues for the projection of Brazilian environmental diplomacy. One of them presents a report on projects to expand the supply of wind and solar energy, and that Brazil will be the leader in the region"". It also published a praising profile of Txai Suruí, the ""best known Brazilian environmental activist in the world"". Another relevant text addresses Lula's political movements for the equality of Brazilian women by mentioning the leadership of the Minister of Women's Affairs, Cida Gonçalves, and the other 10 ministries led by women, for the first time in Brazil's history. Since the beginning of April 2022, iii-Brasil has collected and analyzed an average of 71 reports per week with prominent mentions of the country in the seven press vehicles analyzed. Throughout the last 48 weeks, iii-Brasil registered on average 49% neutral tone reports, 34% negative tone mentions, and 16% positive texts about the country.

2023-03-14,Make it local: Deforestation link to less Amazon rainfall tips activism shift,419,"Mar 14, 2023( Mongabay News: http://news.mongabay.com Delivered by Newstex)   A new study supports mounting evidence that deforestation in the Amazon Rainforest correlates with a reduction in regional rainfall.Experts say this research reinforces the findings of other studies that claim the Amazon is leaning toward its 'tipping point' and the southern regions are gradually becoming drier.Environmentalists see this research as an opportunity to reshape conservation activism and policy towards local communities. Scientists and activists have tirelessly campaigned for the protection of forests to mitigate rising global temperatures and preserve humanity's future. For some local Amazonian communities, who depend on logging, mining and ranching, these claims have stood in the way of their livelihoods, creating a standoff between conservationists and deforesters.  But a new study[1] shows that these local communities should be alarmed about the future of their environment too. It confirms what scientists and activists have been saying for years: Human-led deforestation in the Amazon Rainforest is causing irregular rainfall patterns not only around the globe but at a local level, leading to conditions that wreck ecological cycles and cripple communities that live in deforested areas. Experts hope this growing body of compelling evidence will encourage decision-makers to create protection policies that can engage these communities as well.  The study published in the journal Nature on March 1 used satellite-based precipitation datasets from 2003 to 2017 to reveal that tropical forest loss in the Amazon, Congo and Southeast Asia causes significant decreases in annual mean rainfall. Even deforestation on a small scale caused some decline, but the greatest impact was observed in areas larger than 2,500 square kilometers (965 square miles) where a reduction of evapotranspiration — the pumping of moisture from trees into the atmosphere — is most dominant. At the largest scale measured — 40,000 square kilometers (15,444 square miles) of affected area — monthly rainfall was 0.25 percentage point (or 0.1 mm) lower for every 1 percentage point of forest loss.  In 2010, the main rivers that make up the Amazon basin experienced strong droughts. At the time, scientists reported droughts were likely to become increasingly intense and occur more frequently due to climate change. Image Rodrigo Baleia/Greenpeace.  'The key thing that we do differently is that we've got a range of spatial scales, so we can understand at the different size scales if there's any differences in precipitation,' Callum Smith, a researcher at the University of Leeds and the lead study author, told Mongabay by video call. 'It gives us more information about what it is about tropical deforestation that most affects the climate in terms of precipitation.'  This approach has allowed the researchers to account for influencing climate factors, such as El Niño and La Niña, and demonstrate a clear correlation between human activity and reductions in regional rainfall.  The results strengthen the case of the Amazon Rainforest's vulnerability to human activity. 'The main message to me is that this study reinforces the understanding that deforestation reduces rainfall, which reduces forest resilience and increases the risk of tipping points and negative impacts on local economic activities,' Bernardo Flores, a scientist in ecosystem resilience at the Federal University of Santa Catarina who wasn't involved in this study, told Mongabay by phone. The 'tipping point[2]' is when the hydrocycle degrades and the drier conditions transform the Amazonian vegetation into a savanna — a process that some scientists say is close to happening in parts of the Amazon[3].  Carlos Nobre[4], one of the researchers who first identified the Amazon's tipping point in 2018, told Mongabay by email that the dry season is four to five weeks longer now in the Southern Amazon than compared with 1970. 'It is very urgent to get to zero deforestation, degradation and wildfires all over that area and across all the Amazon forest before 2030,' he wrote.  A severe drought in the Brazilian Amazon in 2005, when the Manaquiri Lake, 150 kilometers (93 miles) from Manaus in the state of Amazonas, was reduced to a stream. At the time, activists described the drought as one of the worst in the biome's history and was linked to human-provoked climate change. Image Alberto Cesar Araújo/Greenpeace. Proliferating damage  The study also gives scientific clout to grassroots stories about the effects of increasingly drier weather conditions and adds to the mounting proof of Amazonian communities being impacted by climate change. 'People on the ground say that when forest is lost, it's drier and hotter,' Smith said. 'But it's been difficult to really pin that down in observations before. The scale approach that we've taken has unlocked that, so we could understand these observations better.'  Case studies indicate how far the effects of the Amazon's changing climate can be felt. In Lucas do Rio Verde, a municipality in Brazil's agricultural powerhouse state of Mato Grosso, producers are experiencing losses as they struggle to produce their usual second crop of corn, Raul Valle, director of social and environmental justice at WWF, told Mongabay by phone. Even farther away, producers in Rio Grande do Sul state are in a third year of drought[5], causing billions of reais in production losses, he added. Estimates[6] from the Federation of the Associations of Rio Grande do Sul Municipalities predict losses will be more than 12 billion reais ($2.3 billion).  'It is not solely and exclusively due to Amazon deforestation; we know the climate system is complex. But there is no doubt that this deforestation also contributes to these losses,' Valle said.  These far-reaching effects can be partly understood by the length scale of moisture recycling. 'The trees make their own rain,' Smith explained. 'Rain falls on the trees and then they pump it back out into the atmosphere and trees downwind rely on that precipitation recycling effect,' he said. The length scale of moisture recycling can be up to an average of 600 kilometers (373 miles) in the Amazon. Up to 70% of precipitation is sourced from upwind evapotranspiration, meaning the fewer trees upwind, the less rainfall and much drier the downwind regions become.  'Tropical forest loss could therefore have severe implications for precipitation in these regions that are hundreds to thousands of kilometers downwind of the forest loss,' according to the study.  The Cuniu River curving through the Amazon Rainforest. The hydrocycle in the Amazon is essential to the forest. Trees upwind pump moisture back into the atmosphere, which then provides rainfall to vegetation downwind up to hundreds of kilometers away. Image Russell Monk/Greenpeace. Deforestation has swept across the Amazon Rainforest in the last few decades, even in legally protected territories such as this area known as the Karipuna Indigenous Land in the state of Rondônia. Image Christian Braga/Greenpeace. A 'complete revamp' of public policies  Creating policies to protect the Amazon is more than just focusing on reducing global carbon emissions, experts claim. Instead, the impact of deforestation on local communities needs to be brought to the forefront and policies need to support regional climate resilience.  'As someone who lives in the UK, we have this perspective as a society of the Amazon as something that needs saving so that we can claim carbon credits and do our bit to lock up carbon,' Smith said. 'Any policy that comes out of this research really should be staying inside the countries and working to better the communities that actually live there.'  According to Marcos Heil Costa, an environmental engineering professor at the Federal University of Viosa, there are proposals in Brazil to create public policies based on payment for ecosystem services, which financially incentivizes private landowners to protect the forest. 'The idea is that a mechanism can be established to pay landowners to not deforest,' Costa told Mongabay by phone. 'They can receive an annual income if they preserve more than they are required to under the Brazilian Forest Code.' The Brazilian Forest Code[7] states that landowners in the Amazon must protect up to 80% of their land — in other biomes, it drops to 20%.  According to Valle, loose legislation that fails to punish those who illegally invade and occupy rainforest territory for agricultural purposes is a 'powerful incentive' to continue removing trees, despite monetary incentives to preserve the land. 'Agricultural expansion becomes horizontal because it's very profitable from an individual point of view,' Valle said.  A truck carrying timber drives through the Amazon Rainforest near Santarm, in the state of Par. Relentless deforestation in the Amazon has caused a reduction of rainfall in the biome, especially in the southern areas, where there is risk of swathes of forest transforming into a savanna. Image Marizilda Cruppe/Greenpeace.  Recent promising changes in Brazilian[8] policy are aimed at protecting the Amazon and all the country's biomes, but experts warn that policies could continue to be created in favor of agricultural development. 'We need an almost complete revamp of our public policies to adapt to this new evidence,' Valle said. The challenge of such an overhaul includes the opposition from the influential agribusiness lobby in Congress, 'who continue to support projects that induce more deforestation.'  However, policies centered on preventing deforestation and building regional resilience benefit the agricultural groups in the long run because less rainfall means more challenges to produce large yields. Valle claims the first step required is to highlight the long-term advantages of sustainable development to agribusiness leaders and challenge the deep-rooted perspective of 'the more you deforest, the better it is because that's how it was in the past,' he said.  Experts say more studies are also required to better channel local needs into effective legislation. 'A major front line in terms of research today is how to translate these non-carbon ecosystem services and put them into actual policies,' Costa said.

2023-02-27,NGOs sue French bank BNP Paribas for financing companies that contribute to Amazon deforestation,420," Environmental and human rights groups said Monday they filed a lawsuit against BNP Paribas, the eurozone's largest bank, for providing financial services to companies they allege are contributing to the deforestation of the Amazon rainforest. Brazilian NGO Comissão Pastoral da Terra and French group Notre Affaire À Tous filed the lawsuit last week in the Paris court, alleging that BNP Paribas failed to carry out adequate checks before agreeing to finance such companies. Paris-based BNP Paribas said in a statement sent to Reuters that it required its clients to have a ""zero deforestation"" strategy in their production and supply chains by 2025. Forest destruction is Brazil's biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions, and climate campaigners are increasingly resorting to lawsuits to pressure large companies to adopt a low-carbon economy. French companies have become a particular focus of attention due to a 2017 French law requiring them to identify and prevent risks to human rights and the environment that could occur as a result of their activities. The case is the second to be directed against BNP Paribas on these grounds, following another complaint filed last week. The first judgment by a French court based on the law is scheduled for Tuesday in a case against oil company TotalEnergies. BNP Paribas said it demanded ""full traceability"" of its beef and soybean supply chains from the Brazilian Amazon and Cerrado from its customers. It pledged to stop offering financial products or services to those who did not agree to this. ""Only a collective commitment from financial institutions can be fully effective,"" said BNP Paribas. ""Simply ceasing to finance these actors would have no positive impact on their practices, as they would continue to rely on a largely sufficient number of lenders for their activity,"" it added."
2023-02-04,Peru : Minam implements digital application to obtain data on deforestation in our Amazon,421,"Ukukui, is the name of the innovative digital application that is being implemented by the Ministry of Environment (Minam) to obtain information on deforestation in our Amazon and thereby design strategies and policies for its adequate conservation. In this regard, the Deputy Minister of Strategic Development of Natural Resources of Minam, Karina Pinasco, said that this tool will be very useful in the conservation strategy promoted by the Environment sector. ""Minam will strengthen the monitoring capacity of forests to measure the magnitude of deforestation and forest degradation, so that policies can be designed and focused in favor of the Peruvian Amazon,"" he said. During the launch ceremony of the aforementioned web platform, he stressed that this initiative contributes to the fulfillment of the climate commitments acquired by the Peruvian State for the benefit of the people who live and work in the forests. For her part, the general director of Climate Change and Desertification of Minam, Milagros Sandoval, said that this application was born in response to the need to bring information to the general population about this environmental problem. In addition, he said that the application will have continuous improvements to improve its performance. Eagle eyes Ukukui is an Awajn word meaning eagle. This name alludes to the fact that, thanks to the digital tool, it will be possible to ""fly"" above our Amazon to monitor the current situation of forests. For this purpose, it has been equipped with a viewer and a description and filters section; This contributes to having the information in an agile and didactic way. The viewer allows the user to ""explore"" and ""land"" on a certain virtual area to make a visual analysis. Meanwhile, the filters make it easier for the user to choose the information of interest. To access the Ukukui, you can click from your computer here https://bit.ly/deforestationdgccd The data: In the launch event, held on the eve, also participated the regional governor of Hunuco, Antonio Pulgar (virtually), the director of Greenhouse Gas Mitigation, Berioska Quispe and the manager of the NGO AIDER, Marioldy Snchez, among others."
2023-03-28,President of Apex exposes deforestation in the Amazon to agribusiness giants in China,422,"The president of the Brazilian Trade and Investment Promotion Agency (Apex Brasil), Jorge Viana, defended in China that the government and the business community should recognize their environmental problems related to the deforestation of the Amazon instead of trying to hide them. Before a delegation composed mainly of agribusiness executives, who suffer external and internal pressure for investments in sustainability and even boycott campaigns against their products, he associated the deforestation of the forest with the advance of cattle raising. ""We Brazilians should stop saying outside Brazil that Brazil has no environmental problem. We do and have for a long time,"" said Jorge Viana, a Brazilian from the Workers Party (PT), former governor of the state of Acre and a forest engineer. He spoke at a seminar organized by the Brazilian Center for International Relations (Cebri), held at the Center for China and Globalization (CCG). ""If we recognize what has already been done wrong, we will be better able to defend the good things we are doing in the Amazon or are trying to do."" China is the main buyer market of national agribusiness products. And the Brazilian President was speaking in front of an audience of about 100 local government representatives, Chinese authorities, and executives from giant companies in the Brazilian market, such as Suzano, JBS and Vale. In the audience were representatives from Syngenta, Cargill and Chinese think tanks, besides diplomats and specialists in international relations and members of the special advisory office of the Presidency of the Republic. Agriculture Minister Carlos Favaro opened the seminar, but was not present for Viana's statement. Viana cited a series of data to support his thesis. According to him, in the last 50 years, 21% of the Amazon has been deforested, an area of 84 million hectares. Another 79 percent of the Amazon remains preserved. ""I want to give very objective numbers. I said that 84 million hectares have been deforested. What are these areas being used for? 67 million hectares for cattle ranching; 6 million for grain agriculture. And 15 million (are) secondary forest"", said the president of Apex. He credited the data to institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture, FAO, and satellite monitoring entities of deforestation, such as Mapbiomas and Imazon. ""Brazil recognizing the problems it has can come up with extraordinary solutions, and those solutions can be very strong in the sense of convincing our interlocutors."" According to Viana, deforestation was reduced in the FHC, Lula 1 and 2, and Dilma Rousseff governments, but doubled in the Jair Bolsonaro government. ""We had problems with the past government. I recognize that the past government encouraged the occupation of indigenous lands and deforestation,"" he said, pondering that the productive sector and civil society decided to confront deforestation. He also said that the Brazilian Forest Code has not yet been fully implemented. For the president of Apex, when the country is able to reverse this trend, still on the rise during the Lula government according to data from Deter, it should also be considered a victory for the productive sector. He proposed technological improvements in land use and forest restoration. He affirmed that Vale, Suzano and Marfrig will recover 4 million hectares of degraded area. Viana said that Lula wants to visit Beijing as soon as possible, after postponing the trip due to health reasons, and defended the formalization of a mechanism for environmental cooperation between Brazil and China, the biggest emitter of greenhouse gases in the world, with emphasis on the carbon credit market."
2023-03-10,Record deforestation in Brazil’s Amazon rainforest shows challenge facing Lula,423,"Deforestation in Brazil’s Amazon rainforest rose in February to the highest level on record for the month, highlighting the scale of the challenge facing the administration of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, as it tries to undo the environmental destruction wreaked under the far-right former president Jair Bolsonaro. Government satellites show that a record 322 sq km of Amazon rainforest were destroyed in February, a 62% increase on last year and the highest number for the month since records began. Lula, who took office on 1 January this year, has pledged to end illegal logging after deforestation soared to a 15-year high during the Bolsonaro years. With the environment ministry once again led by the environmentalist Marina Silva , who oversaw a sharp drop in deforestation in the same role during Lula’s first term in office, the government has reactivated the Amazon Fund, a key tool for preservation, and recreated a civil society council on the environment – both abandoned under Bolsonaro. Silva has also brushed off and updated a deforestation prevention and control plan that formed the backbone of her successful policies nearly two decades ago. These are important steps, but “innovation is necessary, as the Amazon today is not the same as it was 10, 20 years ago”, said a Greenpeace Brazil spokesperson, Rômulo Batista. Crime and violence exploded under the previous government, as Bolsonaro’s disdain for the rainforest and the people who protect it emboldened criminals of all kinds, including the killers of the Indigenous expert Bruno Pereira and British journalist Dom Phillips. Addressing the crisis will require rebuilding the manpower of environmental agencies that were gutted by the far-right populist, a process which cannot happen overnight, said Batista. “The land grabber, the deforester, the illegal miner, they are making the most of this time to rush to cut the forest down,” Batista said. After preliminary data pointed towards the jump in destruction in February, Silva told reporters last month that loggers were working even during the Amazon’s rainy season as a “sort of revenge” against the current government’s crackdown. Deforestation figures are typically lower at the start of the year, as the Amazon rainy season hinders forest clearing and cloud cover means satellites are less likely to pick up on it. For this reason, analysts had cautioned against celebrating a drop in deforestation in January. "
2023-03-11,Record deforestation in Brazil's Amazon for February: Agency,424,"BUENOS AIRES Deforestation in Brazil's Amazon jungle hit a record in February, according to new data released Friday from the country's National Space Agency (INPE) The data shows 322 square kilometers (79,568 acres) of the jungle was deforested in February, according to the DETER System by INPE. The figure reveals a 62% increase compared to February 2022 when 199 square kilometers were deforested. The states with the highest records of deforestation were Mato Grosso with 162 square kilometers, Para at 46 square kilometers, Amazonas at 46 square kilometers and Roraima with 31 square kilometers. In the Cerrado, deforestation hit 558 square kilometers in February, an increase of 98% compared to February 2022, as 282 square kilometers were deforested. Many environmentalists and defenders of Indigenous peoples and their territorial rights criticized former President Jair Bolsonaro's policies, insisting he rolled back environmental protections, causing ecological destruction as illegal loggers, miners and ranchers have cleared large swathes of land. In November 2022, before assuming the presidency, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva pledged at the UN climate change conference, COP27, to protect the Amazon rainforest, telling officials in the first three years of the Bolsonaro administration, deforestation increased 73%, while last year, 13,000 square kilometers were deforested. He pledged to strengthen inspection bodies and monitoring systems and clamp down on ""environmental crimes."" Since returning to the presidency, Lula has sought to strengthen environmental bodies, created an Indigenous Ministry and relaunched the ""Amazon Fund"" that seeks to safeguard the Amazon biomass. In a written statement, Frederico Machado, a specialist in conservation and leader of the World Wildlife Fund-Brazil's Zero Conversion Strategy, described it as ""difficult to reverse the damage of an anti-environmental policy in such a short time, as the numbers for the first two months of 2023 do not reveal a clear trend."" He believes that deforestation will decrease ""when there is a consistent reversal of the weakening of the institutions in charge of inspection, and when the new government's speech gains more materiality."" ""The important thing at this moment is the resumption of command and control actions, strengthening of the organs that have been scrapped in recent years, valuing the people of the forest and their knowledge and the implementation of a sustainable economy, an area in which Brazil has great potential and can take on a leading role,"" added Machado."
2023-03-10,Record deforestation in Brazilian Amazon in February,425,"Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon and fragile Cerrado savanna hit record highs in February, according to government figures released Friday, showing the challenges President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva faces to reverse surging environmental destruction. Satellite monitoring detected 322 square kilometers (124 square miles) of forest cover destroyed in Brazil's share of the world's biggest rainforest last month, up 62 percent from February 2022, the previous record, according to the national space agency's DETER surveillance program. In the Cerrado, a biodiverse tropical savanna to the south of the Amazon, satellites identified 558 square kilometers of destruction, up 99 percent from February 2022 and nearly double the previous record of 283 square kilometers, from February 2020. The numbers did not come as a surprise: Amazon deforestation had already broken the record for February just 17 days into the month. But they were not the figures veteran leftist Lula was hoping for after two months in office, having vowed to reverse rampant environmental destruction under his predecessor, far-right ex-president Jair Bolsonaro (2019-2022). Lula, 77, is facing international pressure to make good on his promise that ""Brazil is back"" as a partner in the fight against climate change, after four years in which average annual deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon surged by 75 percent compared to the previous decade. The president's office and environment ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment. With its hundreds of billions of carbon-absorbing trees, the Amazon is a critical buffer against global warming. But studies show its carbon uptake is in decline amid rising deforestation, driven, in agricultural powerhouse Brazil, mainly by cattle ranching and farming. Since taking office, Lula and respected Environment Minister Marina Silva have moved to rebuild Brazil's environmental protection agencies, relaunched a defunct national action plan to protect the rainforest and gotten international donors to revive the so-called Amazon Fund, which includes more than $580 million for anti-deforestation operations. Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon fell 61 percent in January, their first month in office. - 'Much more work needed' - Environmental groups appeared ready to give the new government a pass as they await figures from the dry-season months that are typically peak deforestation season, starting around July. ""It's difficult to reverse the damage of an anti-environmental policy in so little time,"" said Frederico Machado of the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) Brazil office. ""Reducing deforestation will only happen when there is a consistent strengthening of the institutions responsible for policing it,"" he said in a statement. Greenpeace Brazil welcomed the new government's efforts, but warned Lula would need to find new ideas to fight deforestation, not just rely on programs from his previous presidency, from 2003 to 2010. ""These are different times,"" spokesman Romulo Batista said in a statement. ""Much more work is still needed."""
2023-03-10,Record deforestation in the Amazon and Cerrado in February,426,"Areas destroyed in the two biomes are equivalent to more than half the city of São Paulo. Deforestation is the largest in the period since the beginning of historical measurement, which began in 2015.The month of February recorded deforestation records both in the Amazon and in the Brazilian Cerrado. The finding comes from data collected by Deter, Inpe's system that maps regions and issues deforestation alerts in real time, according to figures released on Friday (10/03), The record was broken even before the end of the month, when deforestation was already the largest in the period since the beginning of historical measurement, in 2015. Accumulated in the month, the area with alerts was 321.97 km² in the Amazon, an increase of 61.8% compared to the same period last year (198.6 km²). In the Cerrado, the situation was even more critical, with numbers reaching 557.8 km², an increase of 97% compared to 2020, which until then held the previous record of 282.8 km². Together, the destroyed areas of the two biomes in February of this year reach almost 880 km², equivalent to more than half of the city of São Paulo (1,521 km²). The state with the highest rates of Amazon deforestation was Mato Grosso, responsible for around 50% of the total (161.83 km²), followed by Pará, Amazonas and Roraima. In the Cerrado, the highest rates of deforestation were recorded in Bahia (268.26 km²), also accounting for almost half of the affected area, with Tocantins, Piauí and Maranhão coming next. Amazon deforestation rose almost 60% in the Bolsonaro administration In the first month of the year, the deforestation of the largest tropical forest on the planet had registered a sharp drop (-61.3%) in the interannual comparison, in addition to having retreated 27% compared to December 2022. At the time, however, specialists emphasized that the data were partial, since the dense cloudiness recorded over the biome in January prevented satellites from capturing devastated areas in more than half of the Brazilian Amazon. It is possible, therefore, that in February the Deter registered the devastation that it was unable to capture in January. During the four years of Jair Bolsonaro's government (2019-2022), the destruction of the biome increased by almost 60% compared to the previous quadrennium, mainly due to the lack of controls and the weakening of environmental agencies. In 2022 alone, the Brazilian Amazon lost 10,277.61 km² of vegetation cover, a level never before seen since measurement with the Deter has been carried out in Brazil. The recovery of the Brazilian Amazon is one of the main commitments announced by President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva since he was elected. Already in his first month in office, Lula reactivated the Amazon Fund, financed by Norway and Germany, and of which he also announced the participation of the United States. The president also revoked measures taken by his predecessor and created a group with 17 ministries to define forest preservation policies."
2023-01-04,Resources for the Future: 'Time Satellite Information for Monitoring Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon',427,"Resources for the Future issued the following working paper (No. 22-22) on Oct. 19, 2022, entitled ""Estimating the Value of NearReal-Time Satellite Information for Monitoring Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon"": The working paper was written by Katrina Mullan, Trent Biggs, Jill Caviglia-Harris, Jime Rodrigues Ribeiro, Thais Ottoni Santiago, Erin Sills and Thales AP West. Here are excerpts: * * * Acknowledgements This research was supported in part through the National Aeronautics and Space Administration cooperative agreement number NNX17AD26A with Resources for the Future to estimate the value of information obtained from satellite-based remote sensing. Additional support is from the National Science Foundation, grant number CNH-L 1825046. * * * 8. Discussion and conclusions In 2004, Brazil began using near-real-time satellite information through the DETER program to detect and report illegal deforestation. This was the start of a substantial drop in rates of deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon that coincided with a period of overlapping public and private deforestation and development policies. Multiple changes in the macroeconomic and policy environments occurred simultaneously, including an expansion in protected areas, increases in the rate of use and enforcement of environmental fines, and changes in commodity prices. To account for and control for these factors, we estimate the change in deforestation after 2004 while conditioning on the other changes that occurred simultaneously to separate the effects of DETER from other influences on deforestation. It is also possible that real-time satellite monitoring changed the effectiveness of fines and protected areas while also altering the incentives for deforestation provided by high commodity prices or regional development policy. We use interactions within our empirical model to account for ways that DETER itself changed the drivers of deforestation, and incorporate this in our estimates of counterfactual deforestation in the absence of DETER. Our DAG highlights the assumptions that are made when including policies on or off the causal path and illustrates the two counterfactuals that we estimate as our upper and lower bounds on avoided deforestation. We find that the initially positive relationship between commodity prices and deforestation and the positive relationship between areas of INCRA settlement and rates of deforestation no longer exist after 2004. Our results indicate that DETER has a large direct, and immediate, effect on deforestation in 2004 and that DETER alters the estimated future rates through indirect effects on other factors that influence deforestation. In total, annual deforestation is substantially higher in the counterfactual scenarios where DETER was not introduced, with the difference increasing towards the end of the study period. In total we estimate the amount of avoided deforestation is approximately 652,000-677,000 km2 between 2001-2015 according to our lower and upper bounds identified in Counterfactuals 1 and 2. This is an area that is similar to the size of Alaska, larger than the combined area of the next three largest states in the U.S. (California, Montana, and New Mexico) and 2.3 times larger than the amount of deforestation recorded in that region in the same time period (282,341 km2). We also estimate the amount of CO2 emissions avoided and find these totals to be about 1.6 trillion tons. Our benefit-costs analysis suggests that the net benefits of satellites are substantial (US$733 million/year-US$4.2 trillion/year) when estimating benefits using the WTP to preserve Amazon rainforest, but that the net benefits range between negative (US$-384 million/year) and lower positive values (US$582 million/year) when estimating the benefits of avoided CO2 emissions. The negative estimates result when the current US government SSC of $51/tCO2 is used in the estimation. Brazil was an early adopter of near-real-time satellite deforestation alerts, but high-frequency satellite data has become more widely available to tropical countries in recent years. For example, Global Forest Watch has worked with varied partners in the tropics to provide GLAD rapid deforestation alerts since 2014, and in 2020, Norway's International Climate and Forest Initiative offered freely available high-resolution monthly deforestation data to any user. Our findings suggest that this type of data can make important contributions to reducing deforestation, but these contributions will depend on how the satellite data are used, made public, and the corresponding support (or lack of support) by public and private agencies. We found that public and private forest conservation policies that were implemented after the introduction of DETER significantly reduced deforestation. However, we cannot determine how effective they would have been in the absence of DETER. Certainly, these policies relied on satellite information, but they used both low- and high-frequency data. We therefore estimate lower and upper bounds based on the assumptions that the policies would have been equally effective without DETER or totally ineffective without DETER. The reality is likely to lie between these bounds, which would indicate that the combination of access to near-real-time satellite data and the motivation to use the data in novel ways can be even more effective than using the data for pre-existing policies and enforcement. Finally, we estimate the benefits of satellites using a time period of declining deforestation. Deforestation started to increase in the Brazilian Amazon after 2012, and has been at decade highs in recent years. Actually, rates in 2021 were the highest since 2006 (INPE 2021) and are on target to be higher in 2022. This reversal highlights that the effectiveness of deforestation alerts and satellite data depends on the willingness to enforce existing forest laws and penalize violations. In the absence of political will to constrain deforestation, the increasing public availability of high-frequency data raises global awareness of increases in deforestation. This can generate external pressures for conservation, for example through supply chain initiatives developed through global commodity markets, and external pressure from NGOs, international organizations and individual foreign governments to enforce and strengthen policy. * * * About the Authors Katrina Mullan is an associate professor in the Department of Economics at the University of Montana.

2023-01-27,Reviews explore impacts of Amazon deforestation,428,"Washington [US], January 27 (ANI): Researchers emphasize the quick and dramatic changes occurring in the Amazon as a result of growing human activities in two distinct reviews. They examine what is known about the drivers and consequences of the region's continuous deforestation and landscape degradation, as well as what needs to be done to avoid the worst results. The Amazon rainforest is one of the most important yet endangered main ecosystems on the planet. It supports almost one-third of all known species and provides critical global ecosystem services that help regulate the planet's carbon and water cycles. However, modern agricultural and industrial activities, as well as broader anthropogenic climate change, are deteriorating Amazonian habitats at an unprecedented rate. Teetering on the brink of irreversible change, continuous forest loss threatens to drive the Amazon above a crucial threshold, with far-reaching consequences for the entire Earth system. In one Review, James Albert and colleagues summarize key findings from the 2021 Science Panel for the Amazon (SPA) Assessment Report, demonstrating how human activities such as regional deforestation are changing Amazonian ecosystems hundreds to thousands of times faster than any naturally occurring climatic or geological phenomenon has in the past - far too quickly for Amazonian species, peoples, and ecosystems to adapt. According to Albert et al., transformative policy actions are required to prevent these outcomes and reduce the global economy demands that largely drive deforestation. ""As we approach an irreversible tipping point for Amazonia, the global community must act now. Policies to prevent the worst outcomes have been successfully identified; implementation is only a matter of leadership and political will,"" write Albert et al. ""To fail the Amazon is to fail the biosphere, and we fail to act at our own peril."" In a second Review, David Lapola and colleagues evaluate the proximate and underlying drivers and consequent impacts of Amazon forest degradation. While most analyses of land use and land-cover change in tropical forests have centred on the causes and effects of deforestation, Lapola et al. focus on other, lesser-studies anthropogenic disturbances, including fire, habitat fragmentation, selective logging, and extreme drought due to human-induced climate change. According to the authors, roughly 2.5 million kilometres of the Amazon forest (roughly 38 per cent of all remaining forests in the region) are currently degraded by these impacts. Carbon emissions from this degradation are equal to, if not greater, than emissions from deforestation and will remain a dominant source of carbon emissions regardless of deforestation rates. As a result, Lapola et al. argue that not only are deforestation policies needed but they must also be complemented with measures to address the disturbances that degrade the Amazon environment.

2023-02-10,U.S. support to stop deforestation in the Amazon: Lula's main goal in Washington,429,"U.S. President Joe Biden meets Friday at the White House with his Brazilian counterpart Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva to discuss democracy and the environment, against the backdrop of the long shadow of Jair Bolsonaro. Stopping the deforestation of the Amazon would help save 345 million people who are at risk of famine in the world and billions more who are being affected by climate change. The Amazon underpins much of the global food system by regulating the world's rainfall patterns. In fact, scientific models published in the Journal of Climate show how continued deforestation of the Amazon will significantly reduce rainfall vital to food production in the United States. In the western U.S., for example, deforestation of the Amazon could be responsible for a 10-20% decrease in precipitation. A worrisome situation considering that together, the United States and Brazil provided 66% of the world's soybeans, 42% of its corn, 30% of its poultry, among many other foods. However, deforestation continues and has already eliminated 17% of the entire Amazon. Experts predict that if 20 to 25% of this rainforest is lost, there will be no point of return . This is emphasized by Natalie Unterstell, president of Brazil's Talanoa Institute. ""The Amazon rainforest has become the central axis of Brazilian foreign policy and also an international policy issue for the US and Brazil because of its importance for food security. If it collapses, this will have a huge negative impact not only on Brazil but also on Latin America and on the fight against global climate change. That's why deforestation has to stop,"" he says. ""Lula is going to have to deliver results."" Completely halting deforestation was one of Lula da Silva's campaign promises. Securing Joe Biden's support to fulfill that promise is one of the main objectives of his visit to Washington. It is an endorsement that will come with responsibilities for Brazil, says Anya Prusa, Albright Stonebridge Senior Director for the Americas: ""The international community is relieved to have Brazil back at the table, and this relief will translate into much-needed funding for the Amazon Fund and other mechanisms. But high expectations mean that Lula is going to have to deliver results"". The Amazon Fund, which Lula hopes the United States will join, was created in 2009 with an initial donation from Norway to help combat deforestation and stimulate sustainable development in Brazil. Bolsonaro froze the fund when he took office in 2019, but Lula restarted it with support from Norway, England and Germany. But this is not the only resource to support Brazil against deforestation, as Bruna Santos, director of the Wilson Center's Brazil Institute, mentions. ""Biden in the past has promised to mobilize $20 billion for the Amazon, but there are other bills stalled in Congress that are important beyond the Amazon Fund, such as for example the forest act or Amazon21, which also represent an important framework."" It is a mobilization of international resources that Lula will have to manage locally to achieve climate goals, says Luiza Duarte, an expert in Brazilian public policy: ""Lula is trying to contain and undo the damage from the actions of the Bolsonaro government at home and abroad, but he faces internal challenges especially in Congress"". It is worth noting that Lula is planning to organize the COP30 in 2025 in the Amazonian city of Belem."
2023-02-02,University of Amsterdam: Deforestation Of Amazon May Be Irreversible,430,"(TNSjou) -- The University of Amsterdam issued the following news release: * * * The rate of deforestation in the Amazon is much higher than previously thought. As a result, there is a risk of reaching a tipping point, after which the ecosystem will be irreversibly altered. And that could have catastrophic consequences for the global climate system, writes a UN panel of leading scientists on 27 January in Science. Carina Hoorn (University of Amsterdam) is one of the authors. ""Human influence in the Amazon is now so significant that natural processes in an area of millions of square kilometers have no time to recover."" * * * About a sixth of all biomass on Earth is produced in the Amazon. The ecosystem is therefore very important for carbon storage. In addition, the area is of unprecedented value for biodiversity: the Amazon is home to 10% of the world's known species of plants and vertebrates. But in recent decades, forest clearing for agriculture and industries such as gold, oil and gas extraction, has been accelerating at an increasing rate, with a massive negative impact on surface water flow. In the last 4 years in particular, deforestation has accelerated fast, with the years 2020 and 2021 standing out in particular, with 17% more deforestation than before. A UN panel on the Amazon Earth scientist Carina Hoorn of the University of Amsterdam is a member of the 'Science Panel for the Amazon', a United Nations initiative that includes 240 researchers from 20 countries. The panel examined the rates of natural and human-induced change in the area. Hoorn was one of two working group leaders of the study on the history of the soil, subsoil, hydrology and climate of system Earth and the history of biodiversity. The report by this working group was published in 2021 and has now led to a scientific review publication in the renowned journal Science. * * * Alarm bell Together with the working group, Hoorn is sounding the alarm bell once again, because deforestation is going much faster than previously thought, the comparative study shows. ""The Amazon is the product of millions of years of development. That is a very different time scale from the one we humans are familiar with. Anthropogenic changes are hundreds to thousands of times faster than natural climatic and geological changes. The system cannot compensate for the rapid destruction we cause."" * * * From carbon sink to source On a geological timescale, nature in the Amazon is quite flexible, says Hoorn. ""We know that the Amazon and surrounding areas had tropical forest 65 million years ago. Forest and wetlands alternated and now the area is once again dominated by tropical forest. Destroying such a system is likely a journey without return. If the natural conditions are deeply disturbed in such a large area it will not be able to recover, and an impoverished, unstable ecosystem will take its place. So far, the Amazon has always been a global carbon sink, but if the threshold is exceeded, it may become a source. The Amazon's role in the global climate thus could reverse."" And due to the Amazon's huge size, this could even result in global climate change. * * * Message to world leaders Hoorn and her colleagues have a message to world leaders: ""Science is deeply concerned about the irreversibility of developments. If the tipping point is passed, it will mean the dawn of an uncertain new era, probably without diverse tropical forests."" Countering deforestation in the Amazon was already a major topic of Brazil's presidential election in autumn 2022, the country where most of the Amazon rainforest lies. Hoorn: ""Former president Bolsonaro saw it as a reclamation area. The new president Lula wants to protect it and has appointed an indigenous Minister of Environment. That is very positive."" Already last year, another group of scientists published a policy brief to turn the tide for the Amazon. They say it is important to actively protect the remaining (original) forest immediately through monitoring and strict control of illegal logging and environmental destruction and fencing off the partly destroyed or recovering forest so that it can grow back naturally. This is possible by enforcing nature policies on a regional scale and involving indigenous people, among other options. * * * Original text here: https://www.uva.nl/en/content/news/press-releases/2023/02/deforestation-of-amazon-may-be-irreversible.html?origin=zvuyIF7VQlmbnXJokCBg7g Copyright Targeted News Services MSTRUCK-8060058 MSTRUCK"
2023-02-28,"US wants 'global' fight against Amazon deforestation, says Kerry",431,"The United States' special envoy for climate, John Kerry, assured on Tuesday (28), in Brasilia, that the fight against the destruction of the Amazon must happen ""at the global level"", and reiterated that Washington will contribute economically, but did not announce the amount. ""We will work together, not just bilaterally, but globally, to bring everyone to the negotiating table,"" Kerry said at a press conference with Environment Minister Marina Silva. ""No country can change things alone [...] A big change is happening, more and more people understand that it's urgent, that it's not optional, and that we have to work together to do much more than before,"" he insisted. Kerry also stated that he intended to return to Brazil to visit the Amazon with Marina Silva, on a date to be confirmed. The visit of U.S. President Joe Biden's envoy to Brasilia took place three weeks after that of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva to the White House. And, as it happened in Washington, the United States reaffirmed its desire to contribute to the Amazon Fund, whose main donors are Norway and Germany, although they have not yet defined figures. ""We are committed to contributing to the Amazon Fund, but also to other entities, and to working bilaterally [with Brazil] on science and development,"" Kerry said after his three-day visit to Brasilia. Asked by a journalist about the amount of the contribution, Kerry talked about ongoing negotiations in the US Congress. ""We have a bill in the Senate aimed at raising $4.5 billion. Another in the House for $9 billion. But now it will take a fight"" to get it done, he detailed. Kerry was referring, in particular, to the ""AMAZON21"" bill, which foresees the creation of a 9 billion dollar fund for forest preservation in developing countries, not only for the Brazilian Amazon. Marina Silva, in turn, recalled that there were ""other instruments"" to help preserve the Amazon, such as the purchase of carbon bonds. At the end of January, during an official visit to Brasilia, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz announced that his country was willing to pay 200 million euros - R$1.1 trillion - into the Amazon Fund. Deforestation has increased considerably under former president Jair Bolsonaro, who was defeated by Lula in last October's elections. The president promised after his victory that he would do everything possible to reduce illegal deforestation in the Amazon to zero by 2030, but insisted on the importance of international aid to achieve this goal."
2023-02-03,"Warming beyond borders: Amazon deforestation heats up Tibet, says new study",432,"India, Feb. 3 -- There are no borders in the fight against climate change, cooperation is the key, says study published in Nature Deforestation in the Amazon rainforest can directly influence temperatures in Tibet, which is more than 15,000 kilometres away from the tropical biome, according to a new report. Climate tipping elements are remotely correlated, meaning that there are no borders in the fight against climate change. Countries must cooperate and take objective actions in cooperation toward the international goal, noted the findings of the study published in Nature Climate Change journal. Also read: Germany commits over $200 million for shattered Brazillian Amazon; but is it enough? Tipping points are thresholds that, if crossed, cause significant changes in a specific region of the Earth system that may be irreversible. The Amazon rainforest is one such tipping point. Even modest, incremental changes in this biome might eventually result in massive, abrupt and permanent changes to the planet. Experts from Beijing Normal University discussed the potential long-term effects and ramifications of the Amazon rainforest's deforestation in their Teleconnections among tipping elements in the Earth system report. The document provided detailed research and evidence on the relationship between tipping elements. Contemporary global discussions suggest that the climate tipping point attainment could occur with a 1-2degC temperature rise. Consequently, the Paris Agreement calls for limiting warming to below 2degC and below 1.5degC as a long-term goal. Also read: Third of Amazon rainforest lost or degraded: Report ""Logging, road construction, and warming are already today stressing the Amazon rainforest, and will likely do so even more in the future - and while the Amazon region is, of course, an important Earth system element by itself, it's also a burning question if and how changes in that region could affect other parts of the world,"" Jingfang Fan from Beijing Normal University told ANI. Some scientists define tipping points as systems that change rapidly once a threshold is crossed. The Earth has 16 climate systems essential for its sustenance. These are tagged 'tipping elements' and have certain temperature thresholds, or tipping points, beyond which even a slight change may lead to irreparable and catastrophic consequences on our planet. Once deforestation reaches this critical stage, even if all tree-cutting were to cease and new trees were to be planted, the rainforest would be irrevocably altered. The researchers have pondered what impact the gradually abating rainforest might have on distant regions across the globe. They procured and analysed global climate data from 1979 to 2019, looking for associations. Giant ice sheets, ocean currents and permafrost regions may have already degraded irreversibly. Other crucial climate systems like the Amazon might be lost forever if the world keeps its emissions open, the scientists warned. Also read: Amazonian biodiversity: Indigenous convoy to bring focus to threats during Montreal summit Proposing a climate network approach to analyse the global impacts of a prominent tipping element, they concluded that the harsh and warmer temperatures in the Amazon correlated with rising temperatures in Tibet and the West Antarctic ice sheet. They have evidence that when it rained more in the Amazon, the other two regions were prone to receive less precipitation. The paper also highlighted that the snow cover on the Tibetan Plateau has been on a decline since 2008. The researchers analysed and studied near-surface air temperature changes in a network of more than 65,000 subregions using data from the last 40 years. In doing so, they could see how changes at one node influenced those at another. The researchers succeeded in detecting a pronounced propagation pathway over more than 20,000 kilometres. They observed that its general trajectory could be plotted from southern Africa through the Arabian Peninsula, then across to Tibet. It was discovered that the journey lasted barely about two weeks. Furthermore, the experts used climate computer simulations to comprehend how global warming, caused by greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels, might modify the long-distance linkages until 2100. ""We've been surprised to see how strongly climate extremes in the Amazon are connected to climate extremes in Tibet,"" Jurgen Kurths from PIK, a co-author of the paper, told ANI. When it's getting warmer in the Amazon, it also does so in Tibet. Hence for temperature, there's a positive correlation, Kurths added.

2023-01-13,"World Bank: 'Model of Amazon Deforestation, Trade and Labor Market Dynamics'",433,"(TNSrep) -- The World Bank issued the following policy research working paper (No. 10163) in November 2022 entitled ""Model of Amazon Deforestation, Trade and Labor Market Dynamics"". The working paper was written by Charly Porcher and Marek Hanusch. Here are excerpts: * * * Abstract This paper develops a dynamic spatial equlibrium model of Amazon deforestation, accounting for trade and labor markets dynamics. It uses this model to study the impact of local sectoral shocks and policies on deforestation. Conditional on the assumptions on key parameters, the analysis suggests the following: 1) an increase in external commodity demand increases deforestation; 2) agricultural productivity gains within the Amazon region likely increase deforestation (but reduce deforestation in the rest of the world) 3) manufacturing productivity in urban centers in the Amazon region decreases deforestation, especially if manufacturing firms have short rural value chains and if complemented by investments in education and training and measures to attract skills; 4) reducing transport costs increases deforestation unless it sufficiently supports higher export competitiveness of urban production; and 5) industrial policy focused on raising urban productivity, especially in sectors with short rural value chains, can reduce deforestation. The paper then discusses how policies aimed at increasing local sectoral productivity in the Amazon region could complement other measures specifically aimed at protecting the forest. Among such measures are incentivizing governments to designate undesignated public forests, enforcing forest protection laws (command and control), incentivizing afforestation, and creating alternative liveli-hoods for farmers in rural and urban areas. * * * Conclusion This paper offers a novel view of the micro-foundations of Amazon deforestation that puts at the forefront the forward-looking motives of deforestation. When the future price of land is high, individuals engage in deforestation, even if the short-term returns to agricultural activity are low. The deforestation decision interacts with individuals' dynamic migration and occupation choices and affects the spatial equilibrium in the Amazon region. The change of perspective is relevant for policy. Deforestation is both a consequence of an expectation of increased agricultural production (due to greater agricultural demand and agricultural productivity) and a defensive strategy of less productive farmers who come under competitive pressures. This calls for an increased focus on the transition of less productive farmers into alternative rural or urban activities in order to reduce deforestation pressures. The model also shows that deforestation is not simply a rural problem. Regional trade and migration linkages offer a role for urban productivity growth in curbing deforestation. The Amazon's structural transformation will lead to higher urban productivity, providing promising economic alternatives to rural individuals. This will help reduce deforestation, especially if urban sectors have limited connections to agricultural value chains. Infrastructure is critical for both rural and urban productivity growth. Yet, improved market access for agriculture also increases pressure for deforestation. This analysis suggests that a focus on urban competitiveness can be an effective counteracting force. The analysis offers some guidance by testing the theoretical effectiveness of various compensation mechanisms. The current analysis is based on parameter estimates from the literature; future steps will calibrate it to actual data. * * * The working paper is posted at: https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/099329011022242501/pdf/IDU0c70e2b6904bc5044f00ab57083ff92196da8.pdf Copyright Targeted News Services MSTRUCK-8042038 MSTRUCK"
2023-03-23,Zero deforestation in the Amazon is now possible-here's what needs to happen,434," March 23 -- Jair Bolsonaro has been defeated in the Brazilian election against Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (""Lula"") to the rejoicing of scientists, environmentalists, and human rights activists in Brazil and beyond. What happens in South America's largest country is globally significant since, among other reasons, the country contains most of the world's largest tropical forest.   Under Lula, Brazil was able to reduce deforestation in the Amazon by 84% between 2004 to 2013 and expand indigenous rights and protection. Lula promised in his acceptance speech to work toward zero deforestation in the Amazon and to protect indigenous areas from the encroachment of mining companies and other interests. Great news. Dozens of countries and hundreds of companies and financial actors have already made bold commitments to halt deforestation. For example, Unilever aims to achieve zero conversion of native ecosystems for palm oil, paper and board, tea, soy and cocoa by the end of 2023. But, to date, such pledges have lacked any teeth in most at-risk areas. Famously, in 2014 the New York Declaration on Forests, a coalition of committed companies, countries, civil society and indigenous groups, pledged to eliminate commodity-driven deforestation by 2020. But in 2021 the group pushed back its deadline until 2030, and many deforestation activists are skeptical that this deadline will be achieved. Little progress so farThus far, even the most ambitious and well-implemented commitments have made little progress. Research colleagues and I published in October looked at the impact of the soy moratorium, a commitment by global traders and the Brazilian industry to stop purchasing soy produced on Amazonian forest lands cleared after 2006. Brazil's huge soy industry is the second largest driver of deforestation after beef. We found that deforestation directly for soy in the Amazon was reduced by 55% between 2006 and 2015. For many companies, this was a very useful achievement as it helped them meet their goals of not sourcing deforestation-linked soy. Yet it did little to protect the Amazon overall since there are other drivers of deforestation and many forest areas with the potential to produce soy were not covered by the commitments. The total avoided deforestation amounted to only 1.6% of the deforestation in the Amazon and less than 1% of all of the deforestation in Brazil during the same period. In fact, our other research published in September has shown that half of the avoided deforestation in the Amazon was offset by deforestation ""leakage"" into the Cerrado (a huge savanna region to the south and east of the Amazon) and other forest regions in Brazil. Colleagues and I have also published research on similar commitments made by cattle companies, which are even less effective than those for soy. However, given the magnitude of cattle-driven deforestation in the Amazon, such policies at least helped to avoid another 3% of Brazilian deforestation. These deforestation reductions are meaningful. But they still leave us far from the goal of zero deforestation, which is needed to avoid potentially catastrophic tipping points in the Amazon. Three reasons for failure (so far)There are three crucial reasons why these existing pledges have failed to do more to protect the world's tropical forests. First, existing commitments cover less than 50% of forests at risk in Brazil and likely an even smaller proportion of forests in other countries. More companies that source deforestation-risk products, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, need to adopt zero-deforestation policies. Otherwise, farmers still have ample opportunities to sell their products grown on deforested lands and avoid committed companies. Second, many of the companies that have made bold global commitments have yet to implement these policies outside of the Amazon and parts of Indonesia and face many implementation challenges to trace and monitor their products. This leaves a major portion of the world's tropical forests still at risk from agricultural expansion. Third, deforestation can leak across areas and actors within a region. For instance, when companies crack down on deforestation in only one ecosystem for only one commodity, deforestation for that commodity may simply increase in the area next door or shift to farms growing products not covered by the policy. This is the case for the soy moratorium in the Amazon, which led to additional deforestation in the Cerrado. It is also the case for oil palm sustainability certification programs, which reduced deforestation in targeted areas in Kalimantan, Indonesia, but caused additional clearing of rainforest elsewhere in Borneo. ...and four reasons to be hopefulLula's election is pivotal to filling these gaps, at least in Brazil. For instance, the new president plans to improve deforestation governance, which will make it much easier both politically and financially for companies to comply with or implement their zero-deforestation commitments. Supportive public policy may encourage more companies to commit in more regions of Brazil. Lula also plans to significantly reduce the power of the Brazilian agricultural lobby, even if it will continue to control a large part of congress. The lobby has fought virulently against an expansion of zero deforestation efforts. The new president can also help to implement Brazil's new payment for environmental services policy framework and channel resources towards jurisdictions that work with companies to help monitor and enforce zero deforestation. Finally, Lula will be able to attract more international finance to end deforestation in Brazil, which is a necessary complement to individual companies' supply chain policies. With this momentum, zero deforestation in the Amazon may become a reality and inspire hope for other at-risk ecosystems throughout the world."
2022-11-27,A desperate wait for water in the Amazon Amazon: ‘Deforestation is depriving the forest of rain',435,"RIO BRANCO, Brazil — In her 60 years in the Amazon, Antonia Franco dos Santos has never had much money. Food was sometimes scarce. But never in the forest, with its heavy rains and endless rivers, had she known a life without water — not until she moved to this city along the southern crest, where her reserves are now down to the last gallon and the deliveryman is nowhere to be seen. ""He'll come,"" Franco says. ""He will.""  It hasn't rained in more than a month. The community pond that Franco and her neighbors used during the rainy season has dried to a muddy puddle. And inside her wooden shack this Monday morning is a stack of dishes, unwashed; a pile of clothes, unwashed; and an infant great-grandchild named Samuel. For Franco, this makes three drought-racked years in a row, living in a landscape she never imagined: an Amazon gone dry. ""I have to hope,"" she says. ""Today will be different. Enough water will come."" For years, scientists have been warning that the Amazon is speeding toward a tipping point — the moment when deforestation and global warming would trigger an irreversible cascade of climatic forces, killing large swaths of what remained. If somewhere between 20 and 25 percent of the forest were lost, models suggested, much of the Amazon would perish. About 18 percent of the rainforest is now gone, and the evidence increasingly supports the warnings. Whether or not the tipping point has arrived — and some scientists think it has — the Amazon is beginning to collapse. More than three-quarters of the rainforest, research indicates, is showing signs of lost resilience. In fire-scorched areas of the Rio Negro floodplains, one research group noted a ""drastic ecosystem shift"" that has reduced jungle to savanna. In the southeastern Amazon, which has been assaulted by rapacious cattle ranching, trees are dying off and being pushed aside by species better acclimated to drier climes. In the southwestern Amazon, bamboo is overtaking lands ravaged by fire and drought. And in the devastated transitional forests of Mato Grosso state, researchers believe a local tipping point is imminent. The rainforest has never been closer to what scientists predict would be a global calamity. Because it stores an estimated 123 billion tons of carbon, the Amazon is seen as vital to forestalling catastrophic global warming. But during the presidency of Jair Bolsonaro, deforestation has risen to a 15-year high. Parts of the forest now emit more carbon than they absorb. If the rest follows, the impact will be felt all over the world. The stakes are highest in the forest itself, where millions of people are reckoning with a hotter, smokier and drier Amazon. Strange sights are being reported: Wells that have gone dry. Streams that have vanished. The arrival of the maned wolf, a species native to South American savannas. Even a scourge familiar elsewhere in Brazil but not here: thirst. One place in its stranglehold is the remote city of Rio Branco in Acre state, where scientists fear that the climate has already changed. The impact on public health is apparent. Acre state was struck by an outbreak of acute diarrhea last year that killed two children, and cases surged again this year. Smoke from rampant forest fires has so polluted Rio Branco's air that dozens of people are sent to hospitals every dry season with respiratory illnesses. The community, beset by another punishing drought, is taking extraordinary steps to survive. Each morning, the local government dispatches a fleet of tank trucks bearing water to a greater number of locations than ever before: schools, hospitals, the prison, and a swelling number of impoverished communities not connected to the municipal water line, where historic sources are running dry and daily existence is now organized around the deliveries. They come to Franco's enclave twice a week, on Mondays and Thursdays, when residents replenish their reserves and the tense wait for the next delivery begins anew. On that Monday morning in late August, Franco hears the water truck's arrival just after 9. But she doesn't move. The eight households in this pocket of the Adauto Frota slum draw water in order of their proximity to the communal tank. And Franco's shack, which she shares with her 17-year-old granddaughter, the girl's boyfriend and their son, is the second-farthest. On the best of days, Franco might get almost all her share, quieting her worries over what might befall baby Samuel if they don't receive enough water. But this morning is hot and dry. The community has gone four days since the last delivery. She wants to believe a spirit of sharing will trump individual need, but when she finally gets the community hose, it's late. She puts the hose into her tank and steps back. The water comes out in a trickle. ""It's weak,"" she says, anxiety in her voice. Others have taken far more than their share. It will be hours before the tank fills, if it does at all. She looks back at her house. The stack of dishes. The pile of clothes. And, most pressingly, Samuel. ""We just have to hope,"" she says. A point of no return? In the 1970s, Brazilian researcher Enéas Salati upended much of what scientists thought they knew about the Amazon. Until then, it was believed that the forest's abundant rain was a function of climate. But Salati found that about half of the precipitation was recycled. There had been a hidden source of water in the Amazon all along, Salati discovered: the forest itself. Water cycles through the biome, to be used and reused. The trees, with deep root systems, drink up rainwater, then secrete the moisture into the atmosphere. Easterly winds then carry it farther inland, where it forms into rain and the process repeats. This understanding became the foundation for a new field of study. If the hydraulic cycle that sustains the Amazon is dependent on its flora, what happens when vegetation is cut down? How much deforestation can the system withstand? Is there a point of no return? One influential study put the trigger at 40 percent deforestation. But then scientists added the variables of climate change and fire and argued that it would take much less. ""We stand exactly in a moment of destiny: The tipping point is here,"" Brazilian climatologist Carlos Nobre and American ecologist Thomas Lovejoy wrote in Science Advances in 2019. ""It is now."" The region most likely to fall first is the southeast, where dry-season temperatures in the past four decades have risen an average of 4.5 degrees Fahrenheit and rainfall has dropped by a quarter. Its collapse could have devastating consequences. Rio Branco, the Acre state capital, is particularly vulnerable. Distant from the Atlantic, dependent on recycled rain, it also sits at the western edge of the arc of deforestation, where three-fourths of the Brazilian Amazon's losses are concentrated. Over the past four decades in Acre, the mean monthly precipitation from June through August — the height of the dry season — has dropped by nearly a third, Utrecht University researcher Arie Staal found. In Rio Branco, it has plunged to a deeper low, from 2.2 inches to 1.4 inches. ""No other region is more affected by the arc of deforestation than the southwest,"" climate scientist Bernardo Flores said. ""We see it already happening: Deforestation is depriving the forest of rain."" The effect is local as well. When Rio Branco knocked down much of its forest, it killed about 200 sources of water that fed the city's central artery, the Acre River. In the coming decades, if trends continue, the river will dip so low that ""not even sewer runoff will go down it,"" said Claudemir Mesquita, a former state environmental official. ""It's an atomic bomb, and it's armed."" The world of ‘pipa' This, now, is the dry season in Rio Branco: Months of overcast skies from the smoke of forest fires. Days so hot that farmhands are sent home. The river ebbing to historic lows. And armadas of water delivery trucks, called ""pipa,"" taking over the roads. Commanding the wheel of one is a thin man with thick, shaggy hair. Over the past two decades, he has become one of Rio Branco's most ubiquitous figures. His name is Fredy Salles. And he's the water man. Every weekday morning at dawn, he drives to the edge of town, where the paved roads give way to dirt. The open-air compound looks just like everything around it: dry and desolate. But this is a ""source,"" where pipa drivers pump up fresh water from an underground aquifer that, for now, still runs deep and cool. As the rising sun breaks through the haze, Salles waits for his 4,200-gallon tank to fill. The height of the dry season is here, and Salles knows it's up to people like him to keep the city running. He drives to schools so the kids will have water to drink. He hurries to the prison to avert a riot. He fuels the children's hospital and the maternity ward. His tank filled, Salles makes the sign of the cross and pulls out into a city that every year feels more different from the one he once knew. He grew up in a community of rubber tappers, where the forest was lush and the water so plentiful that he couldn't have dreamed of it drying up. Salles is a pipa driver, here to serve the thirsty. Salles first saw such need just after the drought of 2010. He'd gone to a community he didn't know to deliver water, and was stunned to find children dirty, families with nothing to drink, everyone hungry. In the Amazon, extreme poverty was nothing new, but rarely had it seemed so raw. Salles began to see these people as the hidden victims of deforestation. They had depended on the forest — fishing from its streams, drinking from its pools — and were destitute without it. He encounters such people everywhere these days, on deliveries that take him deeper into the countryside, even to Indigenous lands, where in one arid stretch nearly 90 miles from Rio Branco, a leader of the Apurinã people waits for his water. Geraldo Apurinã, 62, looks out at the sun-wilted territory that little resembles the one in which he grew up. In front of his wooden house now runs a federal highway that changed everything here, even lending its name to the reserve: Apurinã Indigenous Territory kilometer 124, BR-317. Highway BR-317, built in 1956, brought the loggers who razed the forest. And the ranchers who dammed the creeks to capture water for their cattle, cutting off the territory's main source. The game the Apurinã had hunted soon disappeared, and the Indigenous leader saw his own people, with little food and water, become agents of the forest's destruction, tearing it down to become cattle ranchers themselves. Now the highway brings in the natural consequence of these losses: water deliveries. The flow from the water truck gushes into his drum. Apurinã looks out upon all that the highway has given him. His grandchildren play on smartphones. His house is wooden and strong. Nearby is a small store where he can buy soda and processed snacks. ""But none of this makes up for what we lost,"" he says. The wait for water For Franco, the best moment of the week is here. It's 6:30 on the morning after the water delivery. She puts some water to boil and makes tea and coffee — two luxuries she couldn't have managed the day before — and glances at the dirty clothes and dishes. The thought of being able to finally clean what needs cleaning brings her such joy that she's almost able to forget that they received far less water than she'd hoped. Franco came here from the river town of Pauini in Amazonas state, 200 miles to the north, far from the arc of deforestation. She'd lived her entire life along the bends of the Purus River, leaving only when her son and daughter asked her to come down to Rio Branco. Her son said he'd built her a small shack next to his house. Wanting the family to be together, she arrived in late 2019 with her granddaughter Sara, in the middle of the rainy season. The pond was overflowing with water. The ground was soggy and fertile. Rain buckets were full. She moved into the shack, feeling light, unaware that the pond would soon dry out, the ground would harden and crack, and the buckets would go weeks without another drop. Now four people live in her shack, and the problem seems so much bigger. The delivered water is about gone, used up on laundry. But chores remain. Standing outside her shack, Franco looks down at what remains of the pond, brown and fetid, more mud than water. Another delivery isn't due for two more days. There's no other choice. She picks up some soap and then lifts the basket of dirty dishes. Balancing it atop her head, she heads down to the diminished pond. She steps out onto a wooden plank at the water's edge and, taking care to skim the only the least-murky bit from the top, starts to pour it onto the dishes. Walking up to her shack, she sees the clean garments hanging on the line. She pulls down the sheets and brings one up to her face. She breathes in the clean smell as deeply as she can, and slowly exhales. She smiles. ""Smells so good,"" she says, and then returns to the darkness of her shack, to check on Samuel. The only thing left to do is to wait for more water. A frightening future For many scientists, the most pressing question is no longer whether the Amazon is reaching a tipping point, but what will come after. Some say the biome that rises from the fires will be a degraded, open-canopy forest. Others say it will remain closed, but deformed. But perhaps the most likely outcome is far more drastic — the destroyed forest giving way to an expansive grassland. Research suggests that the savannization of the Amazon, coupled with global warming, would subject millions in the region to potentially deadly heat. Even if carbon emissions are reduced, 6 million Brazilians could face that risk. But if emissions continue on their current trajectory, by the turn of the century about a third of the Brazilian Amazon's population — 11 million people — will face temperatures that pose ""extreme risk to human health,"" researchers reported last year in the scientific journal Communications Earth &amp; Environment. The next century could see an exodus from the Amazon, an outflow that would reconfigure the Americas. As Salles drives past a roadside inferno early one morning, that prospect seems even closer. Rio Branco already feels on the brink of collapse. The afternoon before, during a 14-hour shift, he received an urgent message: The prison was out of water. He refilled its tanks in time, but found himself worrying. Any number of unforeseen events can delay the water and ignite a riot. He passes a second fire. Flames envelope a distant field. Salles doesn't see how this cycle of fire, deforestation and drought will ever break. Most everyone he speaks with believes that deforestation is depleting the water and that those who are suffering the most are the poor. And yet, it's precisely this poverty that's being used to justify more devastation. The politicians who say developing the Amazon will bring economic prosperity are the ones here who get votes. In October's presidential election, Bolsonaro lost the contest, but won an overwhelming share of the vote in the arc of deforestation. Even Salles has voted for such candidates. Not because he didn't fear the environmental consequences of their vision, but because the daily plight of the poor seemed more urgent. Rio Branco has the smallest economy among Brazilian state capitals. People need work, even if the jobs they take lead to more destruction. He passes a third fire. Out there, beyond the rising smoke, is his next stop: Franco's community. To Salles, she's the quiet woman who lives at the back of the enclave. To Franco, however, the sight of his water truck is deliverance, proof that God is good. ""Today will be better,"" Franco says. ""Today there will be more water."" The difficult math has not changed. One 2,600-gallon tank. Eight homes to fill. Franco, too afraid to confront her neighbors in an area dominated by gangs, is still seventh in line. But she thinks she'll get more this time. Finally, the dishes will get the cleaning they need. The community tank is filled. Each of the six homes before hers takes its fill. Then her household is finally next in line. It's again late in the day. Yelling with glee, she runs down to the community hose, gurgling with fresh water. Moving quickly, she fits it to another hose, and then another. Then she places the end of the final hose into her water drum and takes a step back, hoping, hoping. ""Oh, my God,"" she says. ""It's weak again."" She looks at her shack, where Samuel is asleep. Then she glances at the pond, where she knows she'll soon have to return, and which, within the month, will be so dry she'll no longer have even its soupy waters as a last resort. She sits down on the bare ground, pulls her knees beneath her chin and, as night descends, listens to water trickle into an empty drum. * Gabriela Sá Pessoa in São Paulo contributed to this report.

2022-12-27,"Acre registers fifth highest deforestation rate in the Amazon in November, says Imazon",436,"Data from the Deforestation Alert System (SAD), released by the Institute of Man and Environment of the Amazon (Imazon), show that in November, Acre was the fifth federative unit of the Legal Amazon with the highest deforestation record with 49 square kilometers of deforested forest. According to the data, 590 square kilometers of deforestation were registered in the Legal Amazon. This represents a 23% increase compared to November 2021, when deforestation totaled 480 square kilometers. Pará leads the ranking, with 47% of deforested area, followed by Mato Grosso (14%), Amazonas (11%) and Rondônia (9%), Acre (8%), Roraima (5%), Maranhão (4%), Amapá (1%) and Tocantins (1%). In November 2022, the majority (64%) of deforestation occurred in private areas or under various stages of ownership. The rest of the deforestation was recorded in Settlements (28%), Conservation Units (6%) and Indigenous Lands (2%). Degradation Also according to Imazon data, the degraded forests in the Legal Amazon totaled 739 square kilometers in November 2022, which represents an increase of 678% compared to November 2021, when the degradation detected was 95 square kilometers. In November 2022 degradation was detected in Mato Grosso (51%), Pará (21%), Tocantins (14%), Amazonas (6%), Acre (4%), Rondônia (3%), and Maranhão (1%)."
2023-03-15,AGU tells STF that Lula's tenure is enough to stop deforestation and slash-and-burn,437,"The first positions of the AGU (Federal Attorney General's Office) have caused surprise in the environmental area. Those who follow legal discussions say that, at the beginning of this government, the manifestations signed by the Union's attorney-general, Jorge Messias, seek to soften the confrontation of socioenvironmental problems that are being questioned in the Supreme Court (STF). The AGU has already manifested itself in at least ten actions at the Supreme Court in an attempt to suspend the judgment or present extenuating circumstances for cases on the green agenda. On Tuesday (14), the agency celebrated the first victory in this series of requests. The main concern of socio-environmental organizations is that the AGU is focused on reviewing the so-called unconstitutional state of affairs, a type of decision-making technique that is applied when it is assumed that there are serious and systematic violations of fundamental rights, caused and sustained by the omission of public policies, whether of an administrative, regulatory or budgetary nature. In a note, AGU says that the manifestations in the Supreme Court seek only to inform and update the court on government measures related to issues addressed in the lawsuits. The unconstitutional state of things sustains five actions in the STF that deal with fundamental rights on issues such as deforestation in the Amazon and burning in the Pantanal wetlands. AGU asks that the judgment of merit consider the end of the unconstitutional state of affairs on January 1, 2023, the date of the inauguration of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (PT), as if the change of command in the Union would be sufficient to correct the environmental distortions. The perception among environmentalists, who prefer not to be named, is that the position has a political character and is legally hasty. The body would try to mark the difference between Lula's administration and that of Jair Bolsonaro (PL), so as not to damage the current president's image, especially abroad, where Lula is seeking to play a leading role. However, by the same token, the canetada would support the idea that the environmental destructuring is over in Brazil, which is not true. Deforestation in the Amazon and the cerrado (savannah) hit record highs in February, even after the government's first efforts to reconstitute the environmental policy. This reading is strengthened when one considers another initiative of the AGU in the STF. The body had already caused discontent among environmentalists by giving a favorable opinion on the use of the so-called good faith to certify the legal origin of gold within two ADIs (direct actions of unconstitutionality) that are trying to overturn the rule. The AGU affirms that the instrument is positive, but has been misinterpreted and misapplied. However, different public agencies, including the Federal Police (PF), claim that the rule ""heats up"" the gold from illegal mining, especially gold mined on indigenous lands and environmental reserves, and facilitates money laundering. Good faith is provided for in federal law 12,844 of 2013, authored by Congressman Odair Cunha (PT-MG). He included the articles in an MP (provisional measure) that dealt with agricultural insurance, without any relation to gold. In other words, as they say in the jargon of Congress, he put a jabuti in the law. The final text was sanctioned by former president Dilma Rousseff. Those who monitor the actions in the STF agree, however, that Lula's environmental policy and team represent a beneficial and radical change in relation to the Bolsonaro administration, whose government was marked by negationism in the area. Environmentalists warn, however, that a good part of the actions in the STF deal with failures that were aggravated by Bolsonaro, but that already existed before and remain in the current scenario. ""There are structural problems in the Brazilian socio-environmental policy. For many years we have been champions in deforestation and one of the leaders in violence against environmental defenders. These problems were deeply aggravated during the Bolsonaro government, producing very serious damage,"" says lawyer Rafael Giovanelli, from WWF-Brazil. ""The new government has adopted important measures to solve the issue, but there is still much to be done. It is important that these cases be judged and that the STF give a firm answer, so that the calamity of recent years is never repeated."" For Paulo Busse, a lawyer with the Climate Observatory, the AGU needs to make the reasons for its positions clearer. ""The AGU needs to explain what it is getting at with its petitions, because saying that there can no longer be an unconstitutional state of affairs in Brazil does not help the environmental agenda, the indigenous peoples, the Amazon, nor the MMA [Ministry of Environment and Climate Change] or the government itself. The structural problems are still there"", he says. Busse also states that the judicial recognition of the unconstitutional state of things opens the way for an official mobilization of the State's own bodies and entities in a joint counter-offensive to monitor and demand the adoption of new actions, capable of reconstituting normality. During the Bolsonaro government, several cases, on the most different fronts, have resorted to this technique in the STF. There are cases in progress that deal with culture, abortion, racism, and the street population, for example. The AGU has requested review only of the green agenda, where the court's position has already begun to be demarcated. In December 2022, the minister Carmem Lúcia pronounced a vote in which she recognized the weakening of the normative framework in environmental matters and the unconstitutional state of things in Brazil when evaluating two actions that deal with deforestation in the Amazon forest, ADPF 760 and ADO 54. The trial was suspended at the request of Justice André Mendonça, In its manifestations to the court on the issue, the AGU states that the Lula government changed the scenario. ""Given the substantial change in the factual and normative framework in which the allegations of non-compliance with the fundamental precepts are sustained, translated here into the actions that have been implemented as of January 1, 2023 and that will be continued and increased henceforth, ensuring the resumption of the State's unequivocal commitment to the environmental issue, there is, therefore, the cessation of the unconstitutional state of affairs,"" says the petition signed by Messias. The MMA also made manifestations in technical notes about the unconstitutional state of things, but in a different tone, highlighting that the government is working to reverse the current scenario. In the first decision favorable to AGU, on Tuesday, which does not deal with the unconstitutional state of things, the minister Gilmar Mendes recognized the change in management and the loss of object of ADPF (Argument of breach of fundamental precept) 981. The recognition of the loss of object of an action leads to the suspension of the trial. This ADPF pointed out the dismantling of the socio-environmental education structure in the ministries of Education and Environment and requested the revocation of three decrees, one from the administration of Michael Temer (MDB) and two from the Bolsonaro government, which have already been suspended by Lula.

2022-12-03,Although Deforestation In Brazilian Amazon Drops Devastation Is Still Widespread,438,"Dec 03, 2022( Latin Times: http://www.latintimes.com Delivered by Newstex)   As incoming President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva works to reestablish protection for the vital rainforest, new government data reveals that deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon has decreased in the 12 months up through July.  11,568 sq km (4,466 sq miles) or more of Brazilian Amazon forest cover was lost between August 2021 and July 2022, according to statistics from the national space agency (INPE) released on Wednesday, Nov. 30, Al Jazeera reported[1].  When compared to the same time last year, when Brazil's far-right President Jair Bolsonaro was in office, deforestation had decreased by 11% since then.  According to environmentalists, Bolsonaro managed the Amazon in a catastrophic manner for four years during which time he was accused of undermining Indigenous and environmental conservation organizations in favor of agri-business and mining interests.  According to INPE data, average yearly deforestation increased under the former army captain by 75.5 percent over the previous decade and by 59.5 percent during the preceding four years.  Lula, a left-wing politician who prevailed in a close election last month, has vowed to stop all deforestation as soon as he takes office on Jan. 1.  Senator-elect Flavio Dino of Brazil, who is serving as Lula's transition team's public security director, informed the media on Wednesday that the incoming administration would establish a new federal police unit specializing in environmental crimes.  The planned unit, according to Dino, would take a comprehensive picture of crimes in the Amazon, where gang violence, illegal mining, deforestation, and drug trafficking are frequently intertwined.  Under Bolsonaro indigenous leaders had expressed concern about the dangers to their communities in the Brazilian Amazon, particularly in regions with little government oversight that farmers, miners, and poachers are trying to take control of and exploit.  Last year, 226 Indigenous lands in 22 Brazilian states were the targets of 305 cases of ""invasions, illegal exploitation of resources, and damage to property,"" according to the Indigenous Missionary Council.  That was up from 109 such incidents in 2018, the year before Bolsonaro took office, a 180 percent increase.  In locations where Amazon deforestation is taking place, Lula could encounter fierce political opposition. He must alsodeal with the difficulty of policing such vast, often remote areas.

2023-01-04,Amazon: more than 80% of protected areas are threatened,439,"By 2023, if the pace of logging is not stopped, the Amazon Rainforest may lose another 11,805 km² of native forest, according to an estimate by the artificial intelligence platform PrevisIA. The size of almost 10 cities in Rio de Janeiro, the predicted devastation will cause even more emissions of greenhouse gases, which are related to the greater frequency and intensity of extreme weather phenomena. Among them are heavy rains, cold and heat waves and prolonged droughts. Developed by Imazon in partnership with Microsoft and Fundo Vale, the tool has already shown an accuracy of almost 80% in predicting deforestation in 2022, which consolidates it as a relevant technology to assist forest protection actions. To validate how accurate PrevisIA was, the researchers crossed the areas that the platform predicted to be at risk of deforestation between August 2021 and July 2022 with the devastation registered by Imazon's Deforestation Alert System (SAD) in the same period. And the result was that 78.2% of the destruction occurred within 4 km of the area indicated by the platform. If this happens, the platform estimates that 2023 will have the second largest deforestation since 2008, second only to 2021. Like Prodes, the federal system that annually monitors deforestation in the Amazon, PrevisIA's risk calculation takes into account the so-called ""deforestation calendar"", which runs from August of one year to July of the following year. Among the nine states that make up the Legal Amazon, the most critical in relation to the risk of deforestation in 2023 are the three largest: Pará, Amazonas and Mato Grosso. Together, they represent 73% of the area under threat of deforestation in 2023 (8,582 km²), according to PrevisIA. This means that state governments will also need to act to prevent this estimate from being realized. Next is Acre, which despite being the second smallest state in the Legal Amazon presented the fourth largest area at risk of deforestation in PrevisIA: 1,269 km². The fifth largest area under threat is Rondônia, 1,094 km², a state that, like Acre, borders Amazonas. On the tool's map it is possible to see that the forests under greatest risk in these states are precisely on their borders, where there is an area of agricultural expansion called Amacro. Besides the states, PrevisIA also points out the municipalities with the forest areas under the greatest risk of devastation in 2023. Among the first 10, half are in Pará. Of the 803 protected areas in the Amazon (indigenous lands, conservation units and quilombola territories), 653 are at risk of deforestation in 2023, according to PrevisIA. This represents 81% of all protected territories. Regarding the total area at risk in the Amazon, 1,806 km² (15%) are within protected areas. The most threatened are the conservation units, where 1,357 km² of forest are at risk of being cut down. Next are the indigenous lands, with 433 km², and the quilombola territories, with 16 km².

2022-11-30,"Amazon deforestation drops 11% YoY, but upward trend signals record high",440,"Deforestation in the Amazon fell by 11.27% in the period from August 1, 2021, to July 31, 2022, reaching 11,568 square kilometers. In the previous period, the forest area cut down in the nine states of the Legal Amazon totaled 13,038 square kilometers. There is not much to celebrate, however, as the good news is dwarfed by what was seen in the region from August to October – 4,020 square kilometers of the forest came to the ground, the largest area recorded in the period since 2015. The performance of the last few months of the Bolsonaro administration reveals a 45% increase in deforestation alerts in the region, a strong upward trend that is left as a legacy for the 2023 result, already under President-elect Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. “The Lula administration will inherit this deforestation,” said a source. The deforestation of 11,568 square kilometers has been unveiled on the website of the National Space Research Institute (Inpe). This is the estimate of the Legal Amazon deforesting system Prodes, the official annual data used by the Brazilian government. The deforested area is equivalent to Jamaica’s territory, the note of the Climate Observatory says. The data from Prodes must be taken with a pinch of salt. There was a decline, but it is a picture of the past. The present trend is surprisingly high, at a moment when inspection agencies have been dismantled and there is no budget or staff to contain the destruction. The Bolsonaro administration ends with an increase of almost 60% in the rate of deforestation in the Amazon to the previous four years of the Rousseff and Temer administrations. “It is the highest percentage increase in a presidential term since satellite measurements began in 1998,” highlights the Climate Observatory press release. The state that deforested the most was again Pará, with 4,141 square kilometers, although it registered a decrease of 20.94% compared to the previous period. Of the nine states of the Legal Amazon, the only one that did not see a reduction in the deforested area was Amazonas, with an increase of 13% to the previous period (2,607 square kilometers). Amazonas, which until a few years ago was the most preserved state in the Amazon, has started to suffer strong pressure. One reason is the expected paving of BR-319, the highway that connects Manaus to Porto Velho and cuts through the state with its mass of intact forests. “The current tendency in Amazonas, if nothing is done, is that the tragedy that occurred around BR-163 (Cuiabá-Santarém), in Pará, which became the epicenter of deforestation at the beginning of the century, after the announcement of its paving, will be repeated in the axis of BR-319,” states the note from the Climate Observatory. The appalling performance of the quarter is based on deforestation alerts in the Legal Amazon according to data from Deter-B, an alert system developed by Inpe. According to Deter, from August to October 2021, for example, the deforested area in the Legal Amazon was 2,779 square kilometers. In the same period in 2010, it was 3,723 square kilometers. “The Bolsonaro administration has been a forest destruction machine. It took the country with a deforestation rate of 7,500 km2 in the Amazon and is delivering it with 11,500 km2. The only thing to celebrate is the fact that this government has come to an end,” said Marcio Astrini, executive secretary of the Climate Observatory, in the press release.

2022-11-30,Amazon deforestation in Brazil remains near 15-year high,441," Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon slowed slightly last year, a year after a 15-year high, according to closely watched numbers published Wednesday. The data was released by the National Institute for Space Research.  The agency’s Prodes monitoring system shows the rainforest lost an area roughly the size of Qatar, some 11,600 square kilometers (4,500 square miles) in the 12 months from August 2021 to July 2022.  That is down 11% compared to the previous year, when over 13,000 square kilometers (5,000 square miles) were destroyed. For more than a decade it looked as though things were getting better for the Brazilian Amazon. Deforestation had declined dramatically and never rose back above 10,000 square kilometers. That was before the presidency of far-right President Jair Bolsonaro , beginning in January 2019.  This will be the last report published under Bolsonaro, as he lost his reelection bid and will leave office Jan. 1. But part of the destruction that took place on his watch will not appear until next year, including the key months from August to October of 2022. A preview of those months comes from a different federal satellite system that issues faster but less accurate data: It shows deforestation skyrocketed 45% over the August to October period the prior year. Traditionally, that time of year sees peak destruction, due to the dry season. An analysis of the new yearly data from Climate Observatory, a network of environmental groups, shows that in the four years of Bolsonaro's leadership, deforestation rose 60% over the previous four years. That is the largest percentage rise under a presidency since satellite monitoring began in 1998. In one state, Para, a fierce rate of destruction went down by 21% yet it was still the center of one-third of all Brazil's Amazon forest loss. Part of the tree cutting and burning happens in areas that are ostensibly protected. One such area is Paru State Forest, where the nonprofit Amazon Institute of People and the Environment registered 2 square kilometers (0.7 square miles) of deforestation in just October. “In recent years, deforestation has reached protected areas where previously there was almost no destruction,"" Jacqueline Pereira, a researcher with the Amazon Institute, told The Associated Press. “In Paru's region, the destruction is driven by lease of land for soybean crops and cattle.” Another critical area is the southern part of the state of Amazonas , the only state that increased deforestation in the most recent data, by 13% compared to the year before. It's largely attributable to Bolsonaro's push to pave about 400 kilometers (250 miles) of the only road that connects Manaus, home to 2.2 million people, with Brazil's larger urban centers further south. Most Amazon deforestation occurs alongside roads where access is easier and land value is higher. Researchers and environmentalists have blamed Bolsonaro's policies for the surge in deforestation. The administration weakened environmental agencies and backed legislative measures to loosen land protections in the name of economic development, paired with a view of occupying a sparsely-populated territory at any cost. This policy has emboldened land robbers and spurred more illegal mining. Bolsonaro's successor, leftist former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, promised cheering crowds at the recent U.N. climate conference in Egypt to end all deforestation in the whole country by 2030. “There will be no climate security if the Amazon isn’t protected,” he said. The last time da Silva was president, from 2003 to 2010, deforestation fell sharply. On the other hand, he backed initiatives that set in motion destruction in the long run, such as the construction of the mammoth Belo Monte hydroelectric dam and generous loans to the beef industry. Chopping down forest for pasture is the primary driver of deforestation. The Amazon rainforest, which covers an area twice the size of India, acts as a buffer against climate change by absorbing large amounts of carbon dioxide. It’s also the most biodiverse forest in the world, and the home of tribes that have lived in the forest for thousands of years, some of them living in isolation. “If da Silva wants to decrease forest destruction by 2023, he must have zero tolerance for environmental crime from Day One of his administration. That includes holding accountable those who sabotaged environmental governance in the country while in office over the past four years,” says Marcio Astrini, executive secretary of the Climate Observatory. ___ Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

2022-11-04,"Amazon deforestation reaches 15-year high and ""sustainable"" fuels are largely to blame",442,"In Europe they are known as ""biofuels"" or ""sustainable fuels"". However, they are not very sustainable. As part of the discourse on energy transition and decarbonization of transport, they have gained significant momentum because their burning and consumption tends to generate fewer emissions into the atmosphere. Despite this, this type of fuel has a hidden side linked to its production process. In order to reach the vehicle's fuel tank, huge quantities of soy vegetable oils are required, the production of which is closely linked to the loss of biodiversity and large forested areas in the Global South. In 2021, Brazil's Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais (INPE) recorded the highest peak in deforestation in the last 15 years, an increase that fits within an upward trend in which the loss of forested hectares has become widespread. Now, a publication by the European group Transport&Environment has published research linking this expansion of logging to the European Union's increased demand for soy and palm biofuels. The trend in deforestation rates is bringing some regions back to the records of the 1990s and this is being exploited by agribusinesses, which are occupying the land and establishing new plantations. Europe, says this research, has become the perfect customer, since in the last five years it has doubled its demand for soy vegetable oils to manufacture so-called biofuels. Fifteen years ago, practically the entire weight of soybean imports by the EU was based on food uses. So much so that, from 2005 to date, 40% of the increase in deforestation in the Amazon associated with soy is directly linked to the demand for biofuels in Europe. In current figures, 30% of the soybeans that the old continent brings from the other side of the Atlantic are destined for the manufacture of fuels classified as sustainable. Furthermore, only 20% of the soybeans grown in the Amazon are destined for direct consumption. In other words, most of the production associated with deforestation has to do with foreign demand, whether for biofuels or to produce food. But why does Europe increasingly want soy instead of other compatible vegetable oils to make biofuels? T&E experts blame this sort of apogee on the European Union's decision to classify palm oil as a high-risk raw material and urge the elimination of its presence in fuels by 2030. The production generated with this type of oil has not been eliminated, but has been oriented towards soy, further concentrating the impacts. This is why European conservation groups are demanding that the European Commission classify soy as a high-risk raw material for deforestation and that, in addition, all other vegetable crops used to produce biofuels be banned. In this way, the aim is to prevent the soybean ban from leading to an increase in other agribusinesses associated with massive logging. From Ecologists in Action, they point out to Público that Spain plays a crucial role in all this ecological devastation, since between 2017 and 2021 it has become the second European country that used the most soybean oil to manufacture fuels, only behind Germany. They thus recall that European states have the capacity to legislate at the national level and prevent the import of products with a value chain tainted by deforestation."
2022-09-23,Amazon deforestation worsened more where cattle herd grew most,443,"The five Brazilian municipalities with the largest increase in cattle herds between 2020 and 2021, all located in the so-called Legal Amazon, accounted for almost one-fifth (17%) of all deforestation carried out in the region last year. The cattle herds of Marabá, Altamira, São Félix do Xingu, and Novo Repartimento (Pará) and Porto Velho (Rondônia) gained 591,700 new heads last year, according to data from the Municipal Cattle Survey released Thursday by Brazil's statistics agency IBGE. The country had a total of 224 million head of cattle last year, 6 million more than in 2020. Those same municipalities reported deforestation of 2.2 million hectares in 2021, according to the most recent data from Prodes, of the National Space Research Institute (Inpe). This accounted for 17% of the entire deforested area in the Legal Amazon, which exceeded 13 million hectares this year. In Marabá, where the cattle herd grew most last year, 73,600 hectares were deforested. In Altamira, the second municipality where the number of animals increased the most, deforestation extended to over 765,500 hectares. São Félix do Xingu, which was for years the leader in cattle herd, was the third municipality with the biggest increase, with a hike of 106,000 animals in 2021. Also last year, deforestation in the municipality reached 577,000 hectares. Another highlight was Porto Velho, the capital of Rondônia, where the herd grew by 86,000 animals and 619,300 hectares were deforested. Novo Repartimento was the fifth municipality that saw its herd grow the most last year, with an increase of 82,600 heads, and where 190,500 hectares were deforested. This concentration of deforestation rates in municipalities where cattle-raising advanced the most was already seen in previous years. In 2020, the five municipalities where the number of animals in the country grew the most also accounted for 14% of the deforestation in the Legal Amazon in the period. In that year, the municipalities where the number of animals increased the most were Novo Repartimento, Pacajá, Marabá, and São Félix do Xingu - all in the state of Pará. ""In the [municipalities] champions of deforestation, cattle are side by side with land expansion. They need to increase the herd to establish land tenure. So, the expansion [of the herd] is not necessarily something that indicates an increase in the economic relevance of cattle ranching in Brazil. Many times, it is more linked to a process of land grabbing than meat production,"" said Raoni Rajão, a professor at the Minas Gerais Federal University and a researcher at the Washington-based Wilson Center.

2023-01-12,Amazon Fund and the end of deforestation may yield R$ 95 billion in ten years,444,"The reactivation of the Amazon Fund and the shift in environmental policy with the change of government should increase the flow of financing for forest preservation and combating deforestation. The Amazon Fund has about R$ 3.7 billion and may receive new donations. The new environmental policy may facilitate the launching of carbon credits in voluntary markets and access to resources of other initiatives, such as the Leaf Coalition, with US$ 1.5 billion in donations from governments and corporations. If the supply of resources can increase, Brazil's potential is gigantic. Considering the minimum price of US$ 10 per carbon credit (one credit is equal to avoiding the emission of one ton of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere), the elimination of deforestation, legal and illegal, in the Amazon would allow the country to raise US$ 18.2 billion (about R$ 95.3 billion) in ten years. The estimate is in a June report, prepared by researchers from the non-profit organization Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) for the Amazon 2030 project, and was based on the minimum price offered by the Leaf Coalition. The Leaf Coalition (Leaf), a public-private partnership, was launched in April 2021. The launch was made at an environmental conference called by US President Joe Biden, which marked the turning point in US policy toward the sector. The goal was to amass $1 billion by the end of that year at COP-26, the United Nations climate summit. Donations from the United States, the United Kingdom, and Norway, among governments, and multinationals such as Amazon, Nestlé, Unilever, Bayer, McKinsey, Boston Consulting Group, Salesforce, Airbnb, and GSK were the first. A year later, the coalition arrived at COP-27 in Egypt with $1.5 billion. On the government side, South Korea joined. Among companies, the fashion chain H&M and Volkswagen were the most recent adherents, in a group that now has 27 corporations, including companies yet to be announced. The value obtained with the preserved forest, the calculation indicates, may jump to US$ 26 billion in ten years if, from 2027 to 2031, the average price of the credit is US$ 15. The Leaf Coalition is a REDD+ initiative (an acronym for ""reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation""). The logic is to form funds to financially reward emerging countries for reducing emissions of gases associated with deforestation by remunerating national or subnational governments for keeping their forests standing. The Amazon Fund, operated by the National Bank for Economic and Social Development (BNDES), supports projects for preservation, sustainable development, or combating illegal logging. They are proposed by governments, educational institutions or non-profit entities, which reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with deforestation. The BNDES selects who receives the funds, according to criteria defined by the donors. The Leaf Coalition has a different model. The objective is to remunerate the results presented, that is, to invest resources for the purchase of carbon credits generated by reductions in gas emissions, certified according to several criteria. Members of the coalition present the proposal to receive funding, after proving that they have reduced emissions by adopting several types of measures. For this reason, says Juliana Santiago, director of Emergent, an American non-profit institution that coordinates the coalition, the Amazon Fund and Leaf can be complementary. Amazon states and even the Union will be able to present proposals to receive funding for actions that have previously been supported by the Amazon Fund. With the project completed, the result of the emissions cut can serve as a proposal for Leaf funding, after proof. ""This keeps the cycle of climate finance permanent and positive for Brazil,"" says Juliana, a licensed BNDES employee and head of the department responsible for the Amazon Fund from 2013 to 2018. At COP-27, there were ""letters of intent"" signed with four states - Amapá, Amazonas, Mato Grosso and Pará. From 2019 to 2022, Brazil isolated itself in global climate debates in face of the escalation of environmental crimes in the country and the posture of the Jair Bolsonaro (PL) administration. With the change of government, several countries have already expressed interest in collaborating again. Despite the offers of foreign aid, the pressure on rich countries for more money to help mitigate the impacts of global warming has grown.

2023-04-08,Amazon has 2nd quarter with highest deforestation since 2016,445,"Deforestation in the Amazon in the first quarter was the second highest since 2016, when the historical series for this period of the Deter alert system began, from the National Institute for Space Research (Inpe), an agency of the Ministry of Science and Technology. In the Cerrado, whose historical series begins in 2019, the first quarter set a devastation record. In the Cerrado, 1,357.38 square kilometers were lost between January and March. In the Amazon Forest, 844.7 square kilometers were deforested in the same period. In March, the biomes registered 357.68 square kilometers and 356.14 square kilometers, respectively, of deforestation. The March data is the third monthly Deter in the Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (PT) government, which said it had a goal of zero deforestation in the Amazon and combat areas of devastation in the biome, such as illegal mining. In the previous four years, the Jair Bolsonaro (PL) government was criticized for weakening the agencies fighting environmental crimes. One of the expectations of the new government to increase protection is the resumption of the Amazon Fund, a program that receives donations from European countries, which had been paralyzed during the last administration. The growing numbers of devastation in the two biomes were driven by the high levels, especially in February. March closes the period of heavy clouds and rain, when destruction figures are historically lower. This year, however, the data of growing deforestation is already worrying. The Deter alerts serve to point out the most devastated areas and guide the actions of agencies such as Ibama and the Chico Mendes Biodiversity Institute (ICMBio). Protection In spite of the advance of deforestation in the Amazon, the biome is the only one in the country with 80% protection conferred by the Forest Code. In the others, like the Cerrado, one of the measures advocated by specialists is the analysis and validation of the Rural Environmental Registry (CAR) made by the rural landowner or squatter. The CAR, not validated, is used by violators as an instrument to try to legitimize irregular land occupations and land grabbing.  The information is from the newspaper O Estado de S. Paulo.

2023-01-18,"Amazon lost almost 3 thousand soccer fields per day in 2022, points Imazon",446,"In 2022, deforestation in the Amazon was the highest recorded in 15 years. This is what the monitoring of the Institute of Man and Environment of the Amazon (Imazon) warns. Between January and December, 10,573 km² were devastated, the equivalent to the cutting down of almost three thousand soccer fields of forest per day. Last year also saw the fifth consecutive annual record of deforestation. Accumulated over the last four years (2019-2022), it reached 35,193 km² - an area that exceeds the size of two Brazilian states: Sergipe (21 thousand km²) and Alagoas (27 thousand km²). The Minister of the Environment and Climate Change, Marina Silva, said in Davos, where she is participating in the World Economic Forum, that the Lula government is committed to ""zero deforestation"". She also mentioned that she has been seeking the path of global philanthropy to attract more investments to the Amazon. ""Even a group of philanthropic institutions that wants to invest in the Amazon Fund is already being organized,"" she declared. Top deforesters Pará (3,874 km²), Amazonas (2,575 km²), and Mato Grosso (1,604 km²) remain at the top of the largest deforesters since 2019. According to Imazon, Amazonas and Mato Grosso had an increase in destruction compared to 2021 in both federal and state areas. ""We hope that this was the last deforestation record reported by our satellite monitoring system, as the new government has promised to prioritize protecting the Amazon. But, for this to happen, it is necessary that the administration seeks maximum effectiveness in the measures to combat devastation, such as those already announced to return to the demarcation of indigenous lands, restructure the inspection bodies and encourage the generation of income from standing forest"", says Bianca Santos, Imazon researcher. In December alone, the Amazon lost 287 km² of forest, an increase of 105% in relation to the same month in 2021, when 140 km² were devastated. This was the month that had the highest deforestation rate of the year. With this, 2022 also had the worst December since 2008, when Imazon's monitoring began. State Conservation Units With regard to protected areas, the state conservation units (UCs) were in a more critical situation in 2022. In these territories, the devastation increased from 690 km² in 2021 to 746 km² in 2022, an 8% increase. Despite being under great pressure, the federal conservation units and indigenous lands recorded a drop of 8% and 21%, respectively, in deforestation in 2022. However, last year's deforestation was the second highest in 10 years in federal protected areas and the fourth highest in the decade in indigenous areas.

2022-11-11,Amazon sets deforestation record for the month of October,447,"Once again this year, the Amazon has registered record increases in deforestation. The National Institute for Space Research (Inpe) announced on Friday (11/11) that the accumulation of deforestation alerts in October 2022 in the Legal Amazon was 904 km² - the number represents a record for the month in the historical series that began in 2015. The announcement comes amid the 27th United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP27). The alerts were made by the Real-Time Deforestation Detection System (Deter), which produces daily signals of changes in forest cover for areas larger than three hectares (0.03 km²) - both for fully deforested areas and for those undergoing forest degradation processes, such as logging, mining, burning and others. Carbon emissions The Deter system is not the official deforestation data, but it alerts us to where the problem is occurring. The official measurement of deforestation, made by the Prodes system, usually exceeds the alerts signaled by the Deter. In the evaluation of environmentalist Charles Dayler Silva de Almeida, the numbers released today are alarming. ""It is a worrisome fact because when the numbers of deforestation and fires in the Amazon reach a record high, consequently we have high carbon emissions. And the other biomes are suffering from the same problem, the Cerrado is one of them."" Almeida reiterates that now the government must study a way to try to curb the deforestation of the Amazon forest. ""This scenario, this situation of another record deforestation is very bad because Brazil runs a great risk of not being able to meet the goals (Paris agreement). Just the maintenance of the current scenario already exceeds and makes this compliance unfeasible."" Pará was the state with the largest area under deforestation alert: 435 km². Next came Mato Grosso (150 km²), Amazonas (142 km²), Rondônia (69 km²), Acre (64 km²), Roraima (24 km²), Maranhão (18 km²) and Amapá (2 km²).

2023-01-11,"Amid Brazil uprising, indigenous Amazon bucks rising CO2 trend",448,"Indigenous lands in Brazil’s Amazon rainforest absorb far more climate changing gases than they emit, in stark contrast to non-indigenous areas where substantial forest loss means Amazon land is fuelling global emissions, researchers say. Brazil’s indigenous-held forests — which make up more than a quarter of its Amazon region — removed about four times more carbon dioxide (CO2) and other gases than they emitted between 2001 and 2021, according to the World Resources Institute (WRI). The findings come as newly sworn-in leftist President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has named tackling deforestation as a top priority, after it increased by roughly 60% under the four-year tenure of his far-right predecessor Jair Bolsonaro. On Sunday, tens of thousands of anti-democratic demonstrators, who have refused to accept Bolsonaro’s October electoral defeat, invaded the Supreme Court, Congress and the presidential palace, seeking to return the former president to power. The uprising, which echoed a 2021 attack on the US Congress by supporters of defeated president Donald Trump, was ultimately dispersed, with Lula promising to punish those involved. In Brazil, Amazon forests are being lost to deforestation and degradation from expansion of farming, mining and other activities, particularly outside indigenous lands, WRI said. Indigenous parts of Brazil’s Amazon forest removed 172mn tonnes of greenhouse gases per year more than they emitted, the US-based think tank found, while non-indigenous areas released 375 million tonnes more than they absorbed. “To our great surprise, if you look at the Amazonian land outside of indigenous lands, they are collectively a source (of emissions) now,” Peter Veit, director of WRI’s Land and Resource Rights initiative, said in an interview. Scientists have warned that the Amazon is edging closer to a tipping point of drying and transformation to savanna from which it might never recover. Lula has promised to halt that trend — a reversal of Bolsonaro’s push for mining and farming expansion in the Amazon. “There is no climate security for the world without a protected Amazon,” he said in a speech at the UN COP27 climate summit in November. Among his first decisions as president, Lula restored the authority of the government’s environmental protection agency Ibama to combat illegal deforestation, and unfroze a billion-dollar fund for sustainability projects in the Amazon. WRI said detailed mapping made it possible for the first time to estimate and compare carbon emissions and sequestration between indigenous and non-indigenous areas in the Amazon. David Gibbs, a WRI research associate, said that while indigenous-held forests are not more efficient at absorbing CO2 from the atmosphere, the communities in those areas are “really making the difference in reducing emissions from deforestation”. Amazon forests managed by indigenous people in all nine countries that make up the Amazon region removed 340mn tonnes of greenhouse gases per year more than they emitted — the equivalent to the United Kingdom’s annual emissions from fossil fuels, WRI said. Txai Suruí, an indigenous youth leader from the Amazonian state of Rondônia, said that protected areas of the rainforest populated by indigenous communities were far better conserved. Her community strengthened its own monitoring efforts to protect its territories during Bolsonaro’s administration, as the community suffered attacks and was neglected by state agencies, she said. Areas not under indigenous protection did not have such monitoring help, she said. Luana Kumaruara, who lives in the Amazonian state of Pará in an area not officially recognised as indigenous but claimed by her Kumaruara people, said they had conserved the land through “self-demarcation of the territory”. “Our indigenous areas are not impacted by agribusiness, deforestation and fires because protecting Mother Earth is part of our upbringing. We don’t use (land) as business or capital.” However, Veit warned that if the collapse of the Amazon ecosystem is to be avoided, deforestation rates must be curbed on non-indigenous land as well in the next few years. “Indigenous people themselves cannot be the saviours of the Amazon alone,” he said. Scientists believe if 20-25% of the original Amazon forest canopy is lost, the region could transition away from being a rainforest, leading to the extinction of thousands of species, and releasing a enormous quantity of CO2 into the atmosphere. A 2021 report into the state of the Amazon basin by more than 200 scientists estimated about 17% of the forest canopy has been lost so far. Tarcísio Feitosa, a prominent environmental activist, said recognising more land as indigenous is a key way to boost forest protection, not just because of communities’ efforts but because it puts more legal barriers in the path of those deforesting land.

2023-01-05,Analysis: Geraldo Alckmin and Marina Silva complete the Esplanade,449,"Vice President Geraldo Alckmin, for Development, Industry, Commerce and Services, and Representative Marina Silva, for the Environment, yesterday held the most attended inauguration ceremonies of the Esplanade, with speeches that point to two priorities, among others: the reindustrialization of the country, which has lost industrial complexity, and the fight against deforestation, a real Columbus egg from the environmental point of view. Both sectors are among the most damaged by the Bolsonaro government's economic policy. Alongside President Lula, Alckmin made a long speech about the situation of the country's productive structure and emphasized that ""reindustrialization is essential to the resumption of sustainable development and that this resumption occurs under the only prism that legitimizes it: that of social justice. For Alckmin, the re-creation of the ministry was necessary ""to rebuild the country and resume the path of development. The novelty in Alckmin's proposal, however, is to make the industrial recovery compatible with the green economy, so that Brazil can be a ""major player in the process of decarbonization of the global economy"" and can integrate the global value chains with investments in innovation and new technologies in the areas where it can be competitive. Although the speech does not please liberal sectors, who see industrial policy as an undue form of state intervention in the economy, Alckmin is right when he says that Brazil cannot do without its industry if it has ambitions to leverage economic growth and develop socially. ""Either the country resumes the industrial development agenda, or it will not recover the path of sustainable growth that generates jobs,"" he said. Alckmin's role will be decisive, also, from the political point of view, because the vice-president of the Republic has always had good relations with the business community, especially in São Paulo. In a certain way, his speech sought a point of balance between the government's economic policy and the market. There is a lot of speculation in the financial market regarding the economic policy of the Lula government and the misalignment between ministers, which generates more confusion, such as the clumsy declarations of the Minister of Social Security, Carlos Lupi, regarding the Social Security reform. Alckmin will be a key player in articulating the Lula government's economic team, which includes Simone Tebet, in Planning, and Carlos Fávaro (PR), in Agriculture, by acting as cotton between the crystals, so that the policy to be adopted by the Minister of Finance, Fernando Haddad, has complementarity in the other portfolios. Deforestation Another star to take office was Marina, who took over the Ministry of the Environment with the purpose of achieving zero deforestation. The impact this could have internationally is formidable, because it strongly reduces the rate of global warming. It is a real Columbus' egg. There is reason for optimism. With the exception of the last four years, no other country has reduced its carbon emissions as much as Brazil. Our differential is our sovereignty over 60% of the largest tropical forest in the world, the Amazon. About 44% of our greenhouse gas emissions come from land use change, that is, deforestation, mainly in the Amazon Region. It is much easier and cheaper - and, therefore, more efficient - to combat deforestation than to make wholesale changes to energy systems, transportation, construction standards, and food production, although this should happen. Brazil has the expertise for this: between 2004 and 2012, it reduced deforestation in the Amazon by 84% and, consequently, its emissions by 67%. The change of course in the ministry, if there is cooperation and interdisciplinary coordination with other portfolios, as announced by Marina Marina, may well make deforestation negligible and find other ways to meet the needs of 38 million Brazilians in the Amazon, about 12% of the population, in generally precarious conditions, who desire and deserve a more prosperous life. There is no point in isolating and treating the forest as an untouched park. It is politically unfeasible and ineffective. The key is to combine environmental control with repression of illegalities and initiatives that make the standing forest more valuable to the local population than cutting it down, as Marina proposed. With the Lula government, having Marina as head of the portfolio, the possibility of a new forest economy opens up, generating products and technology. The potential for pharmacological and chemical discoveries from biodiversity is also enormous and can replace low-productivity cattle farming and illegal mining. Vice President Geraldo Alckmin, for Development, Industry, Commerce and Services, and Representative Marina Silva, for Environment, were the protagonists yesterday of the most crowded inauguration ceremonies of the Esplanade, with speeches that point to two priorities, among others: the reindustrialization of the country, which has lost industrial complexity, and the combat against deforestation, a real Columbus' egg from the environmental point of view.

2023-02-10,"Biden and Lula meet with focus on democracy, climate change and Ukraine",450,"Washington, Feb. 10 - U.S. President Joe Biden and his Brazilian counterpart, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, will meet this Friday at the White House with the focus on the promotion of democracy, the fight against climate change and the war in Ukraine. A high-ranking U.S. official gave to the press some details of the official agenda of the meeting, scheduled for 15.50 local time (20.50 GMT). It will be the first face-to-face between Biden and Lula as presidents of their respective countries, although they know each other from when the American was vice president with Barack Obama (2009-2017). They first met in 2009 on a trip Biden made to Chile, the official detailed. Biden, who believes that a good foreign policy is based on communication with other leaders, wants to develop a ""personal bond"" with Lula to make clear to him the importance that the relationship with Brazil has for his government, said the cited source. Specifically, the two presidents will talk about how to strengthen their trade relations, while respecting workers' rights and promoting the fight against climate change with special attention to the Amazon, the official added. One of the unknowns is whether Biden will use the visit with Lula to announce what would be the first U.S. contribution to the Amazon Fund, which was created in 2009 to help combat Amazon deforestation and was financed mainly with contributions from Norway and Germany. Norway and Germany froze their contributions to that fund with the advance of Amazon deforestation under the government of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro (2019-2023); but have expressed their desire to resume them already with Lula in power. Beyond the Amazon, the other major theme of the meeting will be the defense of democracy, especially after Bolsonaro's supporters stormed the headquarters of the three branches of government in Brasilia on January 8. A similar event took place in the United States on January 6, 2021, when supporters of the then president, Donald Trump (2017-2021), forced their way into the Capitol. According to the aforementioned official, the two leaders will talk about democracy in their own countries, but will also talk more broadly about initiatives to strengthen it regionally and around the world, including the so-called ""Democracy Summit"" that Biden has promoted and that will be held in March this year. Lula and Biden will also discuss the war in Ukraine, the issue on which they have the most differences, since the Brazilian has not explicitly condemned the Russian invasion and has suggested that Ukraine also bears ""part of the responsibility"". The Brazilian president has also advocated dialogue and at the end of January proposed the creation of a group - made up of the United States, Germany, France, Brazil, India and China, among others - to mediate in the conflict. In addition to meeting with Biden, Lula is scheduled to meet today with the leftist Senator Bernie Sanders, and with representatives of the largest trade union federation in the United States, the AFL-CIO.

2022-10-17,Bolsonaro or Lula: in which government was the deforestation rate in the Amazon higher?,451,"One of the themes to be highlighted during the first debate of the second round of the 2022 elections was the deforestation of the Amazon. In the second block, former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (PT) said that the current government is ""playing at deforestation, at 'opening fences,' at cutting down trees. ""We will win the elections to be able to take care of the Amazon and not allow there to be invasion of indigenous land and illegal mining."" President Jair Bolsonaro (PL), running for re-election, hit back and asked viewers to do an internet search.  Link to Image Link to Image Deforestation rate in the Amazon has increased in recent years, federal government statistics reveal - Getty Images via BBC News Brazil  ""Give a Google: 'deforestation from 2003 to 2006', in the four years of Lula's government. Then search 'deforestation from 2019 to 2022,'"" he said. Looking at Lula, Bolsonaro added: ""During his government, twice as much was deforested as during mine. Link to Image Link to Image During the debate, Lula and Bolsonaro used most of the time to talk about pandemics, fake news, and corruption - Reproduction/TV Bandeirantes  But what do the data say? In fact, the total area of forest destroyed during the first three years of the Lula administration was higher compared to the same period of Bolsonaro in office - but the deforestation rate was significantly reduced and reached historic lows between 2006 and 2015, especially during the period in which Dilma Rousseff (PT) assumed the presidency. To get an idea, the area deforested per year fell almost five times between 2003 and 2015. In contrast, the numbers have risen again more recently, with a new acceleration of deforestation between the governments of Michel Temer (MDB) and Bolsonaro. Between 2016 and 2021, the area destroyed each year almost doubled. Check out what the figures on deforestation in the Amazon show below.  Brake and accelerator The official information about the destruction of areas of the Amazon Forest comes from the Prodes Project, which is conducted by the National Institute for Space Research (INPE), linked to the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovations. The agency has been monitoring the forest by satellites since 1988 and the data obtained serve as a basis for the government to update public policies related to the region and environmental preservation. In absolute numbers, it is possible to see that the area deforested in the Amazon in 2003, the first year of the Lula administration, was 25.3 thousand square kilometers. In the following year, the destroyed area grew to 27.7 thousand square kilometers. As of 2005, however, there was a drop in these rates. There were 19 thousand km² that year, followed by 14.2 thousand (2006), 11.6 thousand (2007), 12.9 thousand (2008), 7.4 thousand (2009) and 7 thousand (2010). Link to Image Link to Image Via BBC News Brazil  That is: during the two mandates of the President of Brazil, the deforestation rate fell 67% .  The numbers continued to decline during Dilma Rousseff's government: the year with the least deforestation in the Amazon in the historical series was 2012, when 4.5 thousand km² were devastated. Since then, the area destroyed has only expanded: with the exception of 2014 and 2017, all recent years have recorded an increase in Inpe's rates. And what specifically has happened since Bolsonaro took office? In the first year of the current government, in 2019, the deforested area was 10,100 km². The rates continued to rise in 2020 (10.8 thousand km²) and in 2021 (13 thousand km²). The data for 2022 are not yet available. In other words: the deforestation rate rose 73% in the first three years of Bolsonaro's administration. Link to Image Link to Image Via BBC News Brazil  Another pondering made by environmentalists involves the legacy that each president received from the previous government .  Deforestation in 2002, when the president was still Fernando Henrique Cardoso (PSDB), was 21.6 thousand km². In 2018, the last year of Michel Temer (MDB) as president, 7,500 km² of forest were destroyed - a proportion three times lower.  Link to Image Link to Image Via BBC News Brazil What about the other biomes? Inpe has also been doing similar monitoring in the Cerrado since 2001. The movement of the graphs is very similar to what happened in the Amazon: growth in the absolute area deforested during the first two years of the Lula administration (28.8 thousand km2 in 2003, a number that was repeated in 2004) and a sustained decline between 2005 (16.9 thousand) and 2012 (9 thousand). The rate of deforestation in this biome rose again in 2013 (13.5 thousand), but showed a new decrease between 2014 (10.9 thousand) and 2019 (6.3 thousand). In 2020 and 2021, deforestation in the Cerrado rose again and reached 7.9 thousand and 8.5 thousand km², respectively. As for the Atlantic Forest, 21.6 thousand hectares (ha) were deforested between 2020 and 2021, an increase of 66% compared to 2019 and 2020 (13 thousand ha) and 90% between 2017 and 2018 (11.3 thousand ha), when the lowest value of the historical series was reached. The data were compiled by the NGO SOS Mata Atlântica. Finally, MapBiomas reveals a similar situation in the Pantanal. The devastated area rose from 24.3 thousand ha in 2018 to 31.7 thousand in 2019 and 42.8 thousand in 2020. The lowest rate of destruction of this biome was recorded in 2015, when 23 thousand ha were deforested. This text was originally published here."
2023-03-16,"Bolsonaro to give lecture on environment in the US, one day after he was due to return to Brazil",452,"After having said last Monday (16) that hewould return to Brazil on March 29,former president Jair Bolsonaro (PL) has been confirmed at a seminar on environment and sustainability that takes place the following day (30) in Florida, in the United States. The seminar organized by Geoflorestas, a São Paulo-based environmental consultancy, will take place at a private Christian college located in the city of Deerfield Beach. ""Come participate in the seminar on Environment and Sustainability with the participation of former president Jair Bolsonaro,"" says an invitation to the event. Throughout his term in office, Bolsonaro has been criticized for his actions related to the environment, especially in relation to the Amazon Rainforest. His management of the area was marked by a sharp increase in deforestation rates and measures that loosened enforcement on environmental crimes. In the last 12 months that former minister Ricardo Salles held the portfolio, Brazil had more than 13 thousand km² of deforestation in the Amazon, the worst rate in 15 years. Salles was removed from his post in June 2021, when he became the target of a Federal Police (PF) investigation for suspected illegal timber exports to the United States and Europe. In Florida since last December, the former president said in a meeting with Brazilian businessmen that he should return to the country one day before the new appointment. ""I always set a date to return. The date set now is the 29th of this month. Seven days before we study the situation: how is Brazil, how are the contacts here"", Bolsonaro clarified to the supporters. In the next few days, the former Chief Executive will also participate in a university event. On March 22, Bolsonaro will be at a business and leadership symposium.

2022-11-30,"Brazil: Amazon deforestation drops, but devastation still rampant",453,"Nov 30, 2022( Al Jazeera English: https://www.aljazeera.com/ Delivered by Newstex)   Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon has fallen in the 12 months through July, new government data showed, as incoming President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva seeks to restore protection[1] for the vital rainforest.  National space agency (INPE) data released on Wednesday showed 11,568sq km (4,466sq miles) of forest cover was destroyed in the Brazilian Amazon from August 2021 to July 2022 - an area larger than Qatar.  That was an 11 percent drop from the same period a year earlier, when deforestation hit a 15-year high[2] under far-right Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro.  'It's better to have a lower number than a higher number, but it's still a very high number - the second highest in 13 years,' said Marcio Astrini, head of the Climate Observatory, an environmental advocacy group.  Wednesday's data closed out four years of what environmentalists call disastrous management[3] of the Amazon under Bolsonaro, who was accused of weakening environmental and Indigenous protection agencies in favour of agri-business and mining interests[4].  Under the former army captain, average annual deforestation rose by 59.5 percent from the previous four years, and by 75.5 percent from the previous decade, according to INPE figures.  'The Bolsonaro government was a forest-destroying machine The only good news is that it's about to end,' Astrini said in a statement. 'The devastation remains out of control. Jair Bolsonaro[5] will hand his successor a filthy legacy of surging deforestation and an Amazon in flames.'  Lula, a left-wing leader who won tightly fought elections[6] last month, has promised to work towards zero deforestation when he takes office on January 1.  'Brazil is ready to resume its leading role in the fight against the climate crisis,' he said shortly after being declared the winner of the October 30 presidential run-off.  Lula, who previously served as Brazil's president from 2003 to 2010, also attended the COP27 climate summit[7] in Egypt earlier this month, where he told hundreds in attendance that 'Brazil is back in the world'.  Brazilian Senator-elect Flavio Dino, who is acting as public security chief in Lula's transition team, told the Reuters news agency on Wednesday that the incoming administration would create a new federal police unit focused on environmental crimes.  Dino said the proposed unit would take a broad view of crimes in the Amazon[8], where deforestation, illegal mining, drug trafficking, money laundering and gang violence are often interlinked.  'There is now a specific complexity of environmental crimes[9], in which there is, a kind of combo of crimes in the Amazon. We no longer have isolated environmental crimes,' he told the news agency.  'You have this sophistication and there is a transnationality, because it involves other countries in the Amazon. So the idea is a specialised unit for greater efficiency and greater articulation with neighbouring countries.'  Under Bolsonaro, Indigenous leaders had raised alarm about the threats their communities face[10] in the Brazilian Amazon, especially in areas with little government oversight that farmers, miners and poachers are seeking to control and exploit.  The Indigenous Missionary Council recorded 305 cases of 'invasions, illegal exploitation[11] of resources and damage to property' on Indigenous territories last year that affected 226 Indigenous lands in 22 Brazilian states.  That was up from 109 such incidents in 2018, the year before Bolsonaro took office - a 180 percent increase.  Carbon Brief, a UK-based climate website, said in a report in September that a Lula election victory could see deforestation drop by 89 percent in the Brazilian Amazon over the next decade and would prevent the destruction of 75,960sq km (29,328sq miles) of rainforest by 2030.  Still, Lula could face tough political opposition[4] in areas where Amazon deforestation is happening, and he also must deal with the difficulty of policing such vast, often remote areas.

2022-12-02,Brazil: Amazon Deforestation in Brazil Remains Near 15-Year High,454,"Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon slowed slightly last year, a year after setting a 15-year high, according to closely watched numbers published Wednesday. The data was released by the National Institute for Space Research. The agency's Prodes monitoring system shows the rainforest lost an area roughly the size of Qatar, about 11,600 square kilometers in the 12 months from August 2021 to July 2022. That is down 11% compared with the previous year, when more than 13,000 square kilometers were destroyed. For more than a decade deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon declined dramatically and never rose back above 10,000 square kilometers. Then came the presidency of far-right President Jair Bolsonaro, beginning in January 2019. This will be the last report published under Bolsonaro, who lost his reelection bid and will leave office January 1. But part of the destruction that took place on his watch will not appear until next year, including the key months from August to October 2022. A because it is the dry season. An analysis of the new yearly data from Climate Observatory, a network of environmental groups, shows that in the four years of Bolsonaro's leadership, deforestation rose 60% over the previous four years. That is the largest percentage rise under a presidency since satellite monitoring began in 1998. In one state, Para, a fierce rate of destruction fell by 21% yet it was still the center of one-third of all Brazil's Amazon forest loss. Part of the tree cutting and burning happens in areas that are ostensibly protected. One such area is Paru State Forest, where the nonprofit Amazon Institute of People and the Environment registered 2 square kilometers of deforestation in just October. ""In recent years, deforestation has reached protected areas where previously there was almost no destruction,"" Jacqueline Pereira, a researcher with the Amazon Institute, told The Associated Press. ""In Paru's region, the destruction is driven by lease of land for soybean crops and cattle."" Another critical area is the southern part of the state of Amazonas, the only state that increased deforestation in the most recent data, by 13% compared to the year before. It's largely attributable to Bolsonaro's push to pave about 400 kilometers of the only road that connects Manaus, home to 2.2 million people, with Brazil's larger urban centers further south. Most Amazon deforestation occurs alongside roads where access is easier and land value is higher. Researchers and environmentalists have blamed Bolsonaro's policies for the surge in deforestation. The administration weakened environmental agencies and backed legislative measures to loosen land protections in the name of economic development, paired with a view of occupying a sparsely populated territory at any cost. This policy has emboldened land robbers and spurred more illegal mining. Bolsonaro's successor, leftist former President Luiz In\xE1cio Lula da Silva, promised cheering crowds at the recent U.N. climate conference in Egypt to end all deforestation in the country by 2030. ""There will be no climate security if the Amazon isn't protected,"" he said. The last time da Silva was president, from 2003 to 2010, deforestation fell sharply. On the other hand, he backed initiatives that set in motion destruction in the long run, such as the construction of the mammoth Belo Monte hydroelectric dam and generous loans to the beef industry. Chopping down forest for pasture is the primary driver of deforestation. The Amazon rainforest, which covers an area twice the size of India, acts as a buffer against climate change by absorbing large amounts of carbon dioxide. It's also the most biodiverse forest in the world, and the home of tribes that have lived in the forest for thousands of years, some of them living in isolation. ""If da Silva wants to decrease forest destruction by 2023, he must have zero tolerance for environmental crime from Day One of his administration. That includes holding accountable those who sabotaged environmental governance in the country while in office over the past four years,"" said Marcio Astrini, executive secretary of the Climate Observatory. - VOA"
2022-11-11,Brazil: Amazon deforestation reaches new high before gov't change,455,"Nov 11, 2022( Al Jazeera English: https://www.aljazeera.com/ Delivered by Newstex)   Deforestation in Brazil's Amazon[1] has hit a new, alarming milestone, government data showed, as environmentalists warn that a 'frantic race towards devastation' is under way before a government transition that is expected to usher in more protection for the rainforest.  Preliminary government satellite data collected by space research agency Inpe and released on Friday showed that approximately 904sq km (349sq miles) were cleared in the region[2] in October, the highest for the month since tracking began in 2015.  From January to October, 9,494sq km (3,666sq miles) were cleared, equal to an area more than 12 times the size of New York City and also a record for the period, exceeding the previous high set in 2019 by 12.7 percent.  Incoming Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who is set to take office on January 1, has promised to bolster environmental safeguards[3] and funding for state agencies tasked with protecting the Amazon.  The rainforest, which is critical to the global fight against climate change, has seen years of increased deforestation under the administration of Lula's predecessor, outgoing President Jair Bolsonaro[4].  The far-right former army captain had pushed for more mining and other development projects[1] in the Amazon, saying they would stimulate the economy.  But rights groups accused Bolsonaro of gutting Brazil's environmental and Indigenous protection agencies, leading to an uptick in deforestation[5] and violence across the sprawling region.  Annual statistics released last year showed deforestation had already surged to a 15-year high[6] under Bolsonaro. His office and the Ministry of the Environment did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the Reuters news agency on Friday.  For his part, Lula, in a victory speech after narrowly defeating Bolsonaro[7] in an October 30 run-off, said Brazil was 'ready to resume its leading role in the fight against the climate crisis', especially by protecting the Amazon.  He also has pledged to 'fight for zero deforestation'.  Lula, who previously served as Brazil's president from 2003 to 2010, will travel to Egypt next week to take part in the COP27 global climate summit[8] and meet international leaders.  'I will travel to Egypt on Monday. I will have more conversations with world leaders in a single day than Bolsonaro[9] did in four years,' Lula said on Thursday during a meeting with legislators in the Brazilian capital, Brasilia.  Rights groups are urging Lula to bolster agencies tasked with protecting the Amazon [File: Bruno Kelly/Reuters]  The Workers' Party leader[10] did not specify who he would meet with, but said he planned to reposition Brazil at the centre of international geopolitics.  Meanwhile, the Brazilian branch of the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) said on Friday that the increase in Amazon deforestation in October was expected, 'but the preliminary data for the first days of November is terrifying.'  'It's a true, frantic race towards devastation' before the change in government, WWF-Brasil said.  'The new government will have a lot of work to do to put the country back on track, to put an end to the perception that the Amazon is a lawless land,' WWF-Brasil's Raul do Valle said in a statement.

2022-12-02,Brazil : Annual deforestation in the Amazon has reduced by 11.27%,456,"Deforestation in the Legal Brazilian Amazon (ALB) fell 11.27% in the period from August 1, 2021 to July 31, 2022 compared to the previous year, according to consolidated numbers from PRODES. The estimated area of ??deforestation in the period was 11,568 km for the nine states of the ALB, a reduction of 1,470 km in relation to PRODES 2020/2021, which was 13,038 km. PRODES considers deforestation to be the complete removal of the primary forest cover by clear cutting or the final stage of a progressive degradation of the forest in which there is loss of the canopy, regardless of the future use of these areas. Deforested areas larger than 6.25 hectares are registered and quantified. Eight of the nine states that make up the ALB registered a reduction in deforestation. Amap was the federation unit that most reduced forest loss, with a 64% reduction. Tocantins, Roraima, Par and Maranho come next with reductions of 27.03%, 23.81%, 20.94% and 19.43%, respectively. Rondnia and Acre recorded 9.62% and 4.72% decreases in deforestation, respectively. Amazonas was the only state with an increase in forest loss (13.05%). COMBATING ENVIRONMENTAL ILLEGAL More than a dozen federal agencies act in concert to combat illegal deforestation, burnings, forest fires and to protect indigenous lands and conservation units, with institutional articulation by the Civil House of the Presidency of the Republic. Operation Guardians of the Biome, one of the initiatives of the Federal Government in the fight against environmental crimes, operates in 15 states, reaching the Amazon, Cerrado, Pantanal, Atlantic Forest and Caatinga biomes. The first phase of the Operation, which took place in 2021, reduced 24% of the areas burned during the worst drought in the last 100 years. The operation rescued 1,580 animals, seized 5,848 m3 of wood, 137 machinery and imposed 1,607 fines. Six operational bases were installed in strategic locations in Par, Amazonas and Rondnia, with a consequent reduction of 21.42% in the aggregate area of ??deforestation in 10 municipalities. Operation Guardians of the Biome also combats illegal mining and other environmental offenses in the Yanomami Indigenous Land, in Roraima, where 53.7 tons of minerals were seized and 37 people were arrested. 162 aircraft used in environmental crimes were also withdrawn from circulation. At each Operation base, helicopters allow teams to act more quickly, through qualified deforestation alerts, produced by the Management and Operational Center of the Amazon Protection System. All PRODES data are available on the TerraBrasilis platform . Technical details can be accessed in the Technical Note published on the website of the National Institute for Space Research (INPE)."
2022-10-07,Brazil: Deforestation of Amazon hit record high in run-up to election,457,"Oct 07, 2022( Deutsche Welle World: http://www.dw.de/top-stories/world/s-1429 Delivered by Newstex)   New figures have highlighted the devastation caused by President Bolsonaro's attacks on environmental rights. Brazil's presidential vote could determine the fate of the Amazon rainforest.Deforestation in Brazil's Amazon rainforest — the largest in the world — hit a year-on-year record in September as far-right President Jair Bolsonaro was preparing to face off against his popular leftist rival in the recent presidential election.  Brazilian space research agency INPE reported on Friday that 1,455 square kilometers (562 square miles) of the forest were cleared last month.  This represents an increase of 48% on September 2021 and surpasses the previous record for the level of deforestation in the month of September set in 2019.  From January to September a total of 8,590 square kilometers of the Amazon was cleared — equivalent to an area 11 times the size of New York City.  Bolsonaro's presidency has been marked by increased destruction of the rainforest as well as increased attacks on Indigenous people living in the Amazon region.  Environmental protections at stake in vote  Fires are common in the Amazon in August and September as rains subside and ranchers and farmers burn off parts of the land that have been cleared of rainforest.  INPE recorded the highest number of fire alerts in September this year since September 2010.  Experts have pointed to the rolling back of environmental protections by Bolsonaro that have allowed illegal clearings to increase.  The accelerating deforestation became clear after the far-right lawmaker took power. The loss of the Amazon not only plays a significant role in global climate change but also means a loss of biodiversity in one of the world's richest biomes.  The forest clearances have ""pretty relevant impacts not only for the biome, but also for the weather and the region's rainfall regime, as well as economic impacts for those who live in the Amazon and Brazil as a whole,"" Mariana Napolitano, WWF-Brasil's science manager said.  The president is now headed to a runoff vote against former President Luiz Ignacio Lula da Silva following an inconclusive first round of voting on October 2.  Lula has pledged to strengthen environmental protections if he wins.  ab/sms (Reuters, dpa AFP)  Notes The views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the ""Newstex Authoritative Content"") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

2022-10-31,Brazil: Lula pledges to end deforestation in the Amazon after election victory,458,"Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva pledged to end deforestation in Amazon after winning Brazil’s election on Sunday. Celebrating his victory over far-right incumbent Jair Bolsanaro, Lula promised bolder environmental action in the next four years. “Let’s fight for zero deforestation,” he said in his victory speech. “Brazil is ready to resume its leading role in the fight against the climate crisis, protecting all our biomes, especially the Amazon rainforest.” “Brazil will fight for a living Amazon; a standing tree is worth more than thousands of logs - that is why we will resume the surveillance of the entire Amazon and any illegal activity, and at the same time we will promote sustainable development.” How have world leaders reacted to Lula’s election win? In congratulating Lula on his victory, a number of world leaders welcomed his green commitments. “I look forward to working together on the issues that matter to the UK and Brazil, from growing the global economy to protecting the planet’s natural resources and promoting democratic values,” UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak wrote on Twitter. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said she looked “forward to working with [Lula] to address pressing global challenges, from food security to trade and climate change.” The change in approach to environmental policies could also unlock negotiations on a trade deal between the EU and Mercosur - a South American trade bloc that includes Brazil. It was officially finalised in 2019 but has been held back by concerns from Europe - particularly French President Emmanual Macron - about the Amazon rainforest. “Together, we will join forces to take up our many common challenges and rebuild the bond of friendship between our two countries,” Macron tweeted following Lula’s victory. Norway to resume aid for the protection of the Amazon On Monday, Norway announced that it would resume subsidies for the protection of the Amazon rainforest. “We had a good and very close collaboration with the government before Bolsonaro and deforestation in Brazil declined greatly under Lula da Silva's (previous) presidency,” Environment Minister Espen Barthe Edie told AFP. Norway was one of the biggest donors to funds for the protection of Brazil’s rainforest. But deforestation has risen dramatically to a level Barth Edie describes as “scandalous”. The country halted its aid in 2019 when Bolsonaro took power. Barth Edie added that around five billion Norwegian krone (€485 million) of unused aid was waiting to be distributed by the Amazon Fund for Forest Conservation and Climate Protection. Now, the country is keen to make contact with Lula’s team as quickly as possible to “prepare for a resumption of the historically good collaboration between Brazil and Norway.” Can Lula bring an end to deforestation in the Amazon? Lula’s victory could cut deforestation in the Amazon by 89 per cent over the next decade, according to an analysis carried out by Carbon Brief. But environmentalists are holding their breath as Lula is left with the massive challenge of reversing Bolsonaro’s damaging policies. Co-founder of NGO the Environmental Justice Foundation Steve Trent says Bolsonaro leaves behind a legacy of weakened environmental legislation, defunded environmental agencies and record levels of deforestation.  Steve Trent Co-founder, Environmental Justice Foundation  The re-election of Lula, he adds, means “people and nature have a chance to recover after the wanton destruction of the Bolsonaro years.” “However, he will need all the support he can get to steer Brazil back towards becoming a global environmental leader.” Lula now faces a “mammoth” challenge to reverse the “intentional environmental and human rights catastrophes” of the previous Brazilian president, Trent says."
2022-11-15,Brazil's incoming government presses for data on Amazon's deforestation,459,"BUENOS AIRES Brazil's vice president-elect called Monday for the current administration to provide data on deforestation levels in the Amazon. Geraldo Alckmin, who is handling the transition between the administration of incoming President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and outgoing President Jair Bolsonaro's government, announced that he had requested the full reports on the Amazon rainforest's deforestation for the last year. ""We requested that the complete reports of the data from Prodes Amazonia and Prodes Cerrado from the period of August 2021 to July 2022 be sent so that we can analyze the information they contain and take the necessary measures,"" said Alckmin. Prodes is a satellite system used by Brazil's National Institute for Space Research (INPE) to observe and record deforestation in the Amazon region. Alckmin, speaking in Brazil's financial capital Sao Paulo, add that the ""numbers already exist"" and underscored ""the need to be informed"" regarding deforestation levels in the Amazon. Alckmin's request was made on the same day that Lula left to participate in the UN climate change conference COP27, which is underway in Egypt's resort city of Sharm el Sheikh. COP27 will be the president-elect's first official visit since beating Bolsonaro in the second-round presidential runoff at the end of October. On Monday, Lula, who has been pushing to re-establish Brazil's presence on the world stage and to clamp down on Amazon deforestation, wrote on Twitter that ""we are returning to the world,"" with an emoji of a Brazilian flag and a globe of the world. On Wednesday at COP27, he is expected to outline his push to tackle deforestation in the Amazon region to world leaders. Last year, Bolsonaro's administration waited until the end of COP26 to release a report that revealed the worst Amazon deforestation in 15 years. The data was reportedly ready before COP26 began."
2023-01-11,Brazil makes official bid for Amazonian city to host COP30,460,"SAO PAULO: Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said on Wednesday he had officially launched a bid for the northeastern city of Belem to host the COP30 international climate summit in 2025, fulfilling a promise he made last year. Lula, who in November attended the COP27 in Egypt as president-elect pledging to recommit the rainforest nation to tackling the climate crisis, said at the time he would name a city in the Amazon to host the 2025 U.N. climate talks. Belem is the capital of the Amazonian state of Para and one of the largest cities in the region by population, second only to Manaus, which hosted games of the 2014 World Cup. Lula said in a video on Twitter that Brazil's foreign relations ministry had formalized Belem as a candidate to host COP30. ""In Egypt I made the pledge that Brazil could host COP30, and I am happy to know that our (foreign relations) minister Mauro Vieira has formalized Belem's bid,"" Lula said in the video alongside Para Governor Helder Barbalho. Lula has been promising to tackle deforestation in the Amazon, which hit a 15-year-high under former President Jair Bolsonaro. He recently named Marina Silva, who oversaw a significant drop in deforestation during his first stint as president in the 2000s, as his environment minister.

2022-11-11,Brazil records worst October in Amazon deforestation since 2015,461,"Almost 1,000 square kilometers of the Brazilian Amazon were lost in October, the worst figure for this month since records became available in 2015, according to official data released on Friday (11), less than two months before the end of President Jair Bolsonaro's term. The deforested area, of 904 km², last month in the largest tropical forest on the planet is 3% greater than that of October 2021, a former record for the month, according to data from the satellite surveillance system DETER, of the National Institute for Space Research (INPE). The NGO WWF-Brazil warned that along with the increase in deforestation, the number of fires ""increased"" after the presidential elections. ""The increase in deforestation and wildfire alerts was expected - yet the numbers for the first 10 days of November are frightening clearly shows an unbridled race for devastation in some states,"" the NGO said in a statement. During the administration of Bolsonaro, a climate change denier, the average annual deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon - caused mainly by the felling of trees for the expansion of cattle pastures and the agricultural frontier, according to experts - increased by 75 percent over the previous decade. The Brazilian Amazon corresponds to 59% of the Brazilian territory, distributed in nine states. More than half of the destroyed area was concentrated in the state of Pará (north), with 435 km² cut down. The accumulated deforestation between January 1 and October 31 this year represents the highest value in the DETER system's historical series, WWF-Brazil pointed out, with the destruction of 9,494 km². President-elect Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva promised ""a living Amazon,"" reactivating policies to protect the forest and combat deforestation, differentiating himself from the far-right president. ""The new government will have a lot of work to put the country back on track, to end this perception that the Amazon is a lawless land,"" Raul do Valle, a public policy specialist with the NGO WWF-Brazil said in a statement. Lula will travel to Egypt next Monday, invited by Egyptian President Abdel Fatah al Sisi to attend the COP27 climate conference, his international preview before taking office on January 1, 2023. The left-wing government intends to regain international prestige with an agenda focused on environmental protection."
2022-11-11,Brazil sets new Amazon deforestation record for October,462,"Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon rainforest broke the monthly record for October, with the destruction of 904 square kilometers (350 square miles), official figures showed Friday. The grim news comes less than two months before far-right President Jair Bolsonaro's four-year term ends. The former army captain is a climate change skeptic and has been heavily criticized over policies seen as encouraging deforestation. The DETER satellite observation system detected a three percent increase in the deforested area of the world's largest tropical rainforest compared to October 2021, making it a record for that month, according to the INPE space research institute. The newly deforested section stretches an area just over half the size of Sao Paulo.  With two months still to go, 2022 is already the worst year for Amazon deforestation since DETER began monitoring it in 2015. However, far higher figures of deforestation were recorded in the early 2000s. So far this year almost 9,500 square kilometers have been destroyed, compared to the total 9,200 square kilometers deforested in 2021. The Brazilian branch of the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) said deforestation and wildfires had ""exploded"" since last month's presidential election, in which Bolsonaro was defeated by leftist Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. Lula, who was also president from 2003-2010, has pledged to eliminate deforestation. ""The increase in deforestation (in October) was expected, but even so, the numbers for the first days of November are frightening, they show an unbridled race for destruction"" before the change of government on January 1, said the WWF. Under Bolsonaro, average annual deforestation increased 75 percent compared to the previous decade. Lula confirmed on Thursday he would attend the COP27 climate summit in Egypt next week. ""The new government will have its work cut out to repair the situation, to end the perception that the Amazon is a lawless land,"" said WWF specialist Raul do Valle in a statement. However, Bolsonaro's environmental policies will keep ""causing damage for some time yet,"" said Andre Freitas from Greenpeace in Brazil."
2022-10-07,Brazilian Amazon deforestation breaks September record,463,"Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon broke the monthly record for September, according to official figures released Friday, triggering calls from environmentalists to vote far-right President Jair Bolsonaro out of office later this month. In the latest worrying news on the rainforest, satellite monitoring showed 1,455 square kilometers (562 square miles) of forest cover was destroyed in the Brazilian Amazon last month, according to national space agency INPE's real-time surveillance program, DETER. The area is equivalent to 25 times the size of Manhattan, and the worst for September since the program was launched in 2015. The previous record for September was also under Bolsonaro: 1,454 square kilometers in 2019. The figures came as Bolsonaro battles to win re-election in an October 30 runoff against leftist ex-president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva (2003-2010), who has vowed to work to achieve net-zero deforestation. Lula -- who also faced criticism at times for his environmental record as president -- won Sunday's first-round election with 48 percent of the vote, to 43 percent for Bolsonaro. Bolsonaro, an ally of the powerful agribusiness sector, has faced international criticism for presiding over a surge of destruction in Brazil's 60-percent share of the world's biggest rainforest, a key buffer against global warming. Since he took office in January 2019, average annual deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon has increased by 75 percent from the previous decade. Experts say the agribusiness industry is driving the destruction by clear-cutting and burning forest to turn it to farmland and pasture. With three months to go, 2022 is already the second-worst year on record for deforestation, at 8,590 square kilometers, according to DETER. That is second only to 2019, Bolsonaro's first year in office, when 9,178 square kilometers were destroyed. The second- and third-worst years were also under Bolsonaro -- 2020 and 2021, respectively. ""Anyone who cares about the future of the rainforest, the lives of indigenous peoples and the possibility of having a livable planet should vote to remove Bolsonaro,"" Marcio Astrini, the executive secretary of the Climate Observatory, a coalition of environmental groups, said in a statement. Bolsonaro's campaign defends his record as ""balancing environmental protection with fair and sustainable economic growth."""
2022-11-30,"Brazilian Amazon deforestation falls, but up 60% under Bolsonaro",464,"Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon destroyed an area bigger than Qatar in the 12 months through July, according to official figures released Wednesday, which showed a decline from the year before -- but a sharp increase overall under outgoing President Jair Bolsonaro. In the latest grim news on the world's biggest rainforest, satellite monitoring showed 11,568 square kilometers (4,466 square miles) of forest cover was destroyed in the Brazilian Amazon from August 2021 to July 2022, according to national space agency INPE's annual deforestation tracking program, PRODES. The figure was a decrease of 11.3 percent from the year before, when INPE detected 13,038 square kilometers of deforestation -- a 15-year high. But it closed out four years of what environmentalists call disastrous management of the Amazon under the far-right Bolsonaro, whose successor, veteran leftist Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, has vowed to work toward zero deforestation when he takes office on January 1. Under agribusiness ally Bolsonaro, average annual deforestation rose by 59.5 percent from the previous four years, and by 75.5 percent from the previous decade, according to INPE figures. ""The Bolsonaro government was a forest-destroying machine... The only good news is that it's about to end,"" said Marcio Astrini, executive secretary of the Climate Observatory, a coalition of environmental groups. ""Jair Bolsonaro will hand his successor a filthy legacy of surging deforestation and an Amazon in flames,"" he said in a statement, urging Lula -- who previously led Brazil from 2003 to 2010 -- to show ""zero tolerance"" for environmental crimes. Bolsonaro's office and the environment ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Experts say the vast majority of the clear-cutting and fires erasing the Amazon are to create new farmland -- especially for cattle ranches in Brazil, the world's top beef exporter. The deforestation figures show the Amazon is being pushed toward a ""tipping point,"" warned Mariana Napolitano, science director at the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) Brazil office. ""Significantly reducing deforestation... is imperative for humankind in the face of the twin climate and nature crises the world is facing,"" she said in a statement. - All eyes on Lula - Environmentalists said the figures had been ready since November 3, and accused the government of stalling their release to avoid embarrassment at the United Nations' COP27 climate conference in Egypt. Bolsonaro, who has faced international outcry over the Amazon, did not attend the conference. Lula did, fresh off defeating Bolsonaro in a runoff election. The 77-year-old president-elect received a rock star's welcome from climate campaigners hoping Brazil will now do a far better job protecting its 60-percent share of the Amazon, whose billions of carbon-absorbing trees are a key buffer against global warming. ""Brazil is back,"" Lula told the conference, vowing to fight to end illegal deforestation and revive the internationally backed, $1.3-billion Amazon Fund to protect the rainforest -- suspended under Bolsonaro. Annual deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon fell by 75 percent during Lula's first presidency, an accomplishment many experts attribute to respected former environment minister Marina Silva -- now tipped to return to the job. But Lula also faced criticism during his previous two terms from environmentalists -- including Silva -- over some policies, such as the controversial decision to push ahead with the massive Belo Monte hydroelectric dam in the Amazon. The latest figures came the same day as a new study that found 90 percent of all land deforested in Brazil has been converted to pasture. The Amazon is the region with the most pasture land, found the study from satellite tracking institute MapBiomas. It found the amount of pasture in the Amazon grew 40 percent in the past two decades, as Brazil emerged as the world's top beef powerhouse. bur-jhb/tjj"
2022-12-02,Brazilian Amazon deforestation remains near 15-year high,465,"By Associated Press Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon slowed slightly last year, a year after a 15-year high, according to closely watched numbers published Wednesday. The data was released by the National Institute for Space Research. The agency's Prodes monitoring system shows that the rainforest lost an area roughly the size of Qatar, some 4,500 square miles, in the 12 months from August 2021 to July 2022. That is down 11 percent compared with the previous year, when over 5,000 square miles was destroyed. For more than a decade, it looked as though things were getting better for the Brazilian Amazon.  Deforestation had declined dramatically and never rose back above 3,861 square miles. That was before the tenure of far-right President Jair Bolsonaro, beginning in January 2019. This will be the last report published under Bolsonaro, as he lost his reelection bid and will leave office Jan. 1. But part of the destruction that took place on his watch will not appear until next year, including the key months from August to October of 2022. A preview of those months comes from a different federal satellite system that issues faster but less accurate data: It shows deforestation skyrocketed 45 percent over the August to October period the prior year. Traditionally, that time of year sees peak destruction, due to the dry season. An analysis of the new yearly data from Climate Observatory, a network of environmental groups, shows that in the four years of Bolsonaro's leadership, deforestation rose 60 percent over the previous four years. That is the largest percentage rise under a presidency since satellite monitoring began in 1998. In one state, ParÃ¡, a fierce rate of destruction went down by 21 percent yet it was still the center of one-third of all Brazil's Amazon forest loss. Part of the tree cutting and burning happens in areas that are ostensibly protected. One such area is Paru State Forest, where the nonprofit Amazon Institute of People and the Environment registered 0.7 square miles of deforestation in just October. ""In recent years, deforestation has reached protected areas where previously there was almost no destruction,"" Jakeline Pereira, a researcher with the Amazon Institute, told the Associated Press. ""In Paru's region, the destruction is driven by lease of land for soybean crops and cattle."" Another critical area is the southern part of the state of Amazonas, the only state where deforestation increased in the most recent data, by 13 percent compared with the year before. It's largely attributable to Bolsonaro's push to pave about 250 miles of the only road that connects Manaus, home to 2.2 million people, with Brazil's larger urban centers farther south. Most Amazon deforestation occurs alongside roads where access is easier and land value is higher. Researchers and environmentalists have blamed Bolsonaro's policies for the surge in deforestation. The administration weakened environmental agencies and backed legislative measures to loosen land protections in the name of economic development, paired with a view of occupying a sparsely populated territory at any cost. This policy has emboldened land robbers and spurred more illegal mining. Bolsonaro's successor, leftist former President Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva, promised cheering crowds at the recent U.N. climate conference in Egypt to end all deforestation in the whole country by 2030. ""There will be no climate security if the Amazon isn't protected,"" he said. The last time da Silva was president, from 2003 to 2010, deforestation fell sharply. On the other hand, he backed initiatives that set in motion destruction in the long run, such as the construction of the mammoth Belo Monte hydroelectric dam and generous loans to the beef industry. Chopping down forest for pasture is the primary driver of deforestation. The Amazon rainforest, which covers an area twice the size of India, acts as a buffer against climate change by absorbing large amounts of carbon dioxide. It's also the most biodiverse forest in the world, and the home of tribes that have lived in the forest for thousands of years, some of them living in isolation. ""If da Silva wants to decrease forest destruction by 2023, he must have zero tolerance for environmental crime from day one of his administration. That includes holding accountable those who sabotaged environmental governance in the country while in office over the past four years,"" says Marcio Astrini, executive secretary of the Climate Observatory."
2023-01-12,Climate change and human rights: HRW's reading of Colombia's policies,466," Between 2018 and 2022, 14% of deforestation in the Amazon was concentrated in the Tinigua, La Macarena, Picachos, Chiribiquete, La Paya and Nukak Reserve parks. / Iván Muñoz ""The great contribution that Latin America can make to face the existential challenge of climate change is to protect the Amazon,"" says, bluntly, Juan Pappier, acting deputy director for the Americas of Human Rights Watch. The U.S. NGO launched this Thursday its global report on human rights in 2022 and in the chapter on Colombia, it states, among other things, that, on the road to protect the Amazon ecosystems, although the country has promised to do much, the results it has obtained have been rather limited. (Read also: Deforestation and peace: What does the evidence say?) The report states that, ""deforestation and forest fires are pushing the Amazon rainforest, a key bulwark against climate change, to a 'tipping point' from which it cannot recover, scientists warn"". There are extremely worrying cases, such as Brazil, where the policies of the now former president Jair Bolsonaro led to deforestation rates not seen in 15 years. Or Venezuela, where illegal mining is seriously affecting the environment and indigenous peoples. Human Rights Watch's diagnosis of deforestation in Colombia is not very encouraging either. First, it recalls that government statistics recorded that by 2021, 174,000 hectares of forest were deforested, an increase of 1.5% over the previous year. Secondly, it explains that at least 9,000 hectares of the deforested area are ""territories officially under the tenure of indigenous peoples, which in some cases caused their forced displacement"". (May be of interest to you: This is Colombia's position in the global ranking that measures performance in the face of climate change) And finally, it recalls that at least two thirds of the area devastated is in the Amazon. Meanwhile, the flagship strategy of the government of Iván Duque to address the problem of deforestation was Operation Artemisa, a military campaign criticized and about which human rights violations were constantly denounced. ""In practice it seemed more focused on capturing peasants who cut down trees than on dismantling the structures behind Colombia's massive deforestation,"" Pappier recalled. On the issue of deforestation, Human Rights Watch recalls, the authorities know who the main actors are. ""Cattle ranchers and FARC dissident groups are the main drivers of deforestation, pressuring residents to cut down trees, extorting farmers, promoting coca leaf cultivation for cocaine production, and threatening conservationists,"" the organization wrote in its chapter on Colombia. (May be of interest to you: Chile and Colombia consult the Inter-American Court on climate crisis and human rights) He adds that, in September 2022, the Minister of Environment, Susana Muhamad, announced that the new government would have another strategy against deforestation, focused on working with communities to prevent logging and promote investigations against the big players involved. ""President Petro's commitment to the issue is valuable and we are very attentive to how it will be implemented,"" commented Juan Pappier. Finally, Human Rights Watch warned in a statement that, in the Americas, ""rampant illegal deforestation is devastating the region's biodiversity and the livelihoods of those who live in the forests and, along with the fossil fuel industry, continues to be a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions."" And on this last front there are not many actions to highlight on the part of Colombia either, because although it committed to reduce its emissions in the Paris Agreement, Climate Action Tracker described the effort the country has made as ""very insufficient"".

2022-11-09,"COLOMBIA RECEIVES SUPPORT FROM GERMANY, NORWAY AND THE UK FOR IMPLEMENTING THEIR AMBITIOUS PLAN TO CONTAIN DEFORESTATION IN THE COLOMBIAN AMAZON",467,"The following information was released by the UK Government: Supported by Germany and local communities, Colombia will work to address deforestation in the Colombian Amazon. From: Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office and The Rt Hon Lord Goldsmith Published 9 November 2022 Minister Lord Zac Goldsmith met with his counterparts Susana Muhamad (Colombia), Jochen Flasbarth (Germany) and Espen Barth Eide (Norway) to express his support to Colombia's ambitious plan to contain deforestation in the Colombian Amazon. Colombia's government has launched an emergency plan to stop deforestation in the Colombian Amazon. The ambitious strategy consists of working with local communities and indigenous people in 22 deforestation hotspots, reaching agreements to strengthen economic, social and environmental conditions in these areas within 100 days of starting office, Colombia's Minister of Environment Susana Muhamad already signed the first agreements with communities to reduce deforestation in Caqueta, the country's second most deforested state in 2021 international partners praise the ambitious plan, and Norway and Germany will contribute 25 million USD under the Joint Declaration of Intent the sustainable use and conservation of the Amazon, the world's largest rainforest, is considered vital to curbing catastrophic climate change and to save unique biodiversity Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, 7 November 2022. Colombia has the third biggest forest area in South America and is known to have one of the most biodiverse forests in the world. In face of rising deforestation in the Colombian Amazon in first quarter of 2022, Colombia's government has launched an ambitious emergency plan to stop deforestation in the Amazon. The Colombian Minister of Environment and Sustainable Development, Susana Muhamad, said: Colombia is committed to the development of a solid forestry economy that contributes to the goals of zero net emissions, the guarantee and protection of the applicable rights of indigenous peoples and local communities, as well as the expansion of efforts to conserve and manage sustainably natural forests. The advances in social agreements with the communities of the areas with the greatest impact of deforestation are highlighted, with the aim of promoting sustainable forest management of natural forests, the ecological restoration of degraded areas and the sustainable use of biodiversity. The plan consists of focusing efforts in 22 deforestation hotspots in the Colombian Amazon and seeks to effectively reduce deforestation in the region where more than 50% of the deforestation of the Amazon is concentrated. Through social dialogue with communities, the Colombian government aims to reach agreements to strengthen the economic, social, and environmental conditions in these areas. Within 100 days after taking office, Minister of Environment Muhamad already signed the first agreements with communities to reduce deforestation. The agreements are part of a wider strategy to develop a National Fund to mobilize finance from national and international sources, promote a Forest Economy, improve sustainable livelihoods, and stop the expansion of the agricultural frontier. Espen Barth Eide, Minister of Climate and Environment, Norway, said: I am impressed by Colombia's ambitious emergency plan to stop deforestation in the Amazon. Such strong political will to protect the Amazon is essential if we are to reach the global climate goals and protect biodiversity, as well as total peace in Colombia. Norway remains a committed partner to Colombia in this effort. Norway, Germany and the United Kingdom stressed their commitment to support the impressive ambitions of Colombia's government in conserving fragile ecosystems such as the Amazon rainforest, whilst also protecting local environmental and human rights leaders and safeguarding the rights and safety of indigenous peoples, campesinos and afro-Colombian communities. Based on Colombia's achievements under the Joint Declaration of Intent, signed during COP25, Norway and Germany announced a donation of USD 25 million in support of Colombia's plan against deforestation. Lord Goldsmith, Minister of State for Climate and Environment at the United Kingdom Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office, said: We want to speed up and grow international support for committed and ambitious forest countries like Colombia, to spur even great action at both the jurisdictional and national level. Regulating voluntary carbon markets is essential for raising the finance we need to meet our climate, nature, and development goals throughout this decade. But those markets must be high integrity from beginning to end, and we are determined to involve rural and forest communities across the board to ensure they benefit from the natural resource they protect. Jochen Flasbarth, German State Secretary in the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development, said: We will keep supporting efforts to reduce deforestation in the future. We have to ensure that our common approach evolves and meets the challenges of the climate and biodiversity crisis. We will continue our engagement in the coming years to work towards these goals together with Colombia, Norway and the UK. It is an investment in our common future. The Joint Declaration of Intent (JDI) between Colombia, Germany, Norway and the United Kingdom is a cooperative partnership and an example of international collaboration, coordination and articulation to meet"
2022-11-10,Congress insists on passing law that encourages deforestation in the Amazon,468,"Congresswoman Elizabeth Medina, from the Teachers' Bloc of Concertación Nacional, has been insisting for a year that Parliament approve her bill, which seeks to promote deforestation in the Amazon. Last July 14, 2022, the legislative proposal obtained enough votes in the Plenary of the Congress, but the Executive Power observed it, so it returned to the hands of the Agrarian Commission. There, the congressmen again voted in favor of the bill, without making any substantive changes, despite reading the reasons why the initiative was harmful to the environment, in a communiqué signed by the President of the Republic, Pedro Castillo, and the Premier, Anibal Torres. The opinion, approved by insistence in the Agrarian Commission, will have to be debated in the Plenary of the Congress to decide if it will become a Law. The Ombudsman's Office, the Peruvian Society of Environmental Law, the Peruvian Association of Biologists, the National Commission for Development and Life without Drugs DEVIDA, among other civil organizations, expressed their disagreement with this legislative initiative. They expect the Executive Branch to observe the initiative again. Attempt against the Forestry and Wild Fauna Law The Agrarian Commission of the Congress approved on November 4, 2022 an opinion by insistence that seeks to modify the Forestry and Wildlife Law. The purpose is to modify articles 29 and 33 of the law, and to add two transitory complementary provisions, as well as a final complementary provision. According to the Executive Branch, the final complementary provision, as drafted, allows people who own land in the Amazon to develop agricultural or cattle raising activities on it, without the Ministry of the Environment giving them permission. Currently, the Peruvian State requires that holders of land in the Amazon adhere to Article 38 of the Forestry and Wildlife Law. This law states that the Ministry of the Environment must study the soils to determine whether they are forested, protected or suitable for agriculture. If they are forest and protection lands, agricultural activities cannot be carried out because they are not used to be worked, but rather to protect fragile ecosystems, preserve biodiversity and capture carbon dioxide, which slows down environmental pollution. Forest and protection lands also represent the identity of Amazonian communities. Tania García, commissioner of the environmental area of the Ombudsman's Office, also warned that this type of land should also not be granted in possession or ownership to any person. ""If it is determined that it is forest or protection land, there is no way you can do agricultural activities. They cannot even give you these lands either in possession or in ownership. The aim is to protect the soil resource because the soil resource sustains an entire ecosystem,"" he explained. When the Ministry of the Environment determines that a type of soil is suitable for agriculture, the regulation obliges the owners of the land to process two permits: the change of soil use and the authorization for land clearing. After carrying out both procedures, the environmental sector concludes how much of the total land is suitable for harvesting crops or raising animals. But the proposal approved by the Agrarian Commission of Congress would also allow land holders to skip these requirements, described in the regulations of the Forestry and Wildlife Law. It took two years to create this regulation precisely because it required prior consultation with Amazonian communities to know what processes they should follow in order to prevent forest and protection soils from being deforested. Now, with the permission that Congress would give them to exploit forest and protection lands, the owners would cut down the trees and carry out agricultural activities on the land. In other words, the Parliament seeks to exploit lands that in reality should not be touched and that citizens and companies no longer have to request the authorizations required by law. ""This represents a threat of massive deforestation and endangers the existence of forests in the Amazon (...) Thus, if a rural property that in general is being used for agriculture and livestock, which additionally has a part of forest, can be used for those economic activities, with the consequent cutting and burning for its change of use,"" said the Executive Power. Endangered forests The National Program for Forest Conservation and Climate Change identified through a study that deforestation in the Peruvian Amazon increased in 2020, a year in which 203,272 hectares of forests were deforested, 37% more than in 2019. The most degraded ecosystems were located in Loreto, Ucayali, San Martin, Madre de Dios and Cusco. With less forest in the Amazon, less carbon would be captured. This makes it impossible for Peru to meet its commitments under the Climate Change Convention, such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 40% by 2030. ""However, the level of deforestation reached in 2020 and that could be repeated in 2021, puts at risk the fulfillment of the commitments assumed"", detected the Executive. The changes that Congress is seeking to make to the Forestry and Wildlife Law would increase deforestation and make this goal even more unattainable. The Executive also pointed out that the bill, approved in the Plenary, lacked analysis of possible impacts on the forest, such as massive deforestation and damage to forest and wildlife resources. In addition, it would violate the Forestry and Wildlife Law and the Constitution. In spite of this, the Agrarian Commission again voted in favor of the proposal without making changes to avoid harming the Amazon. Tania García, from the Ombudsman's Office, affirmed that the changes made to the bill are more dangerous and encourage the deforestation of forests. ""With the changes made, land classification, land use change would no longer be required; it would no longer be important that you respect ecological and economic zoning. Nor would forest zoning be required,"" he said. The aforementioned zonings help determine the usefulness of each type of land. If the legislative proposal is approved as it is, it would free land owners in the Amazon from more permits. For the specialist, this legislative initiative will not solve the farmers' problems because forest and protection soils are not suitable for agricultural activities. They usually last up to five years if fertilizers and chemicals are not used, which would not be very convenient for farmers. ""There are millions of hectares in the highlands that are suitable for agriculture. Agriculture can be promoted on land that is indeed suitable for it. But what they do, instead of looking for solutions, is to deforest biodiversity. It doesn't matter if this affects indigenous territories because that is another very important human component,"" he said.

2022-11-16,"COP in Brazil stimulates deforestation reduction in the Amazon, says Carlos Nobre",469," Climatologist Carlos Nobre, one of the greatest references in global warming, praised the idea of taking the Climate Conference (COP) to the Amazon in 2025, as promised by president-elect Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (PT) in a speech on Wednesday, 16. The researcher followed the PT's speech at the Amazon governors' pavilion at COP-27, in Sharm el-Sheik, Egypt. ""(The idea of hosting the COP) is very good because it makes us look forward. With a COP in three years, we are going to fight hard to greatly reduce deforestation and then Brazil will be a great leader, maybe one of the greatest in the world,"" said Nobre, researcher at the Institute for Advanced Studies at USP and scientific director of the Institute for Climate Studies at the Federal University of Espírito Santo. Lula confirmed that he will ask the United Nations Organization (UNO) to host the event in three years - possibly in Amazonas or Pará. This request was made by the consortium of Amazonian governors, led by Helder Barbalho (MDB), head of the Pará state government. ""If Brazil manages to reduce deforestation in the Amazon and Cerrado, which are still very high, it will become the first country in the world with high emissions to reach its Paris Agreement goals (climate pact signed by 195 countries in 2015). We can reach the 2030 goal before 2030 and the 2050 goal in 2040? he said. The Brazilian goal foresees reaching carbon neutrality (offsetting all greenhouse gas emissions) by mid-century. About 50% of Brazilian emissions come from deforestation, ""almost all of it illegal"", highlights Nobre. China, on the other hand, has 80% of its emissions related to the burning of fossil fuels - which makes cutting atmospheric pollution more difficult, given the economic impacts and the costs of energy transition. Scientist defends zero deforestation in the forestIn the case of the Amazon biome, specifically, Nobre argues that it is necessary to ""zero out"" deforestation, even though the Forest Code allows landowners to clear 20% of their areas. The measure is necessary, he argues, because the Amazon is very close to the so-called tipping point (point of no return), a stage from which the biome will no longer be able to recover, which will have severe impacts on the region's biodiversity and the planet's climate. ""To save the Amazon, which is very close to the tipping point, we will need to zero deforestation - throughout the Amazon, not just in Brazil. We have more than 1 million square meters deforested and another 1 million degraded. There is no need to deforest any more, we can triple food production in the region without cutting down a single tree"", he emphasizes. In the last four years, the Jair Bolsonaro administration has been the target of criticism due to the escalating deforestation in the Amazon. The international community's expectation is that Lula will promote a change in the policy for combating environmental crimes."
2022-11-11,Deforestation brings the Amazon to a point of no return,470,"Deforestation is increasing in the Amazon forests, whose integrity may reach a point of no return, directly affecting 47 million people and aggravating the planetary climate and biodiversity crises, warned a new report by the World Wildlife Fund. According to WWF's ""Amazon Alive 2022"" report, presented at the World Climate Summit in this Egyptian city, 18% of Amazon forests have been completely lost, another 17% are degraded and data from the first half of this year show that the damage continues to grow. The loss of the Amazon biome could directly affect the livelihoods of 47 million people living in this region spread across nine nations, including 511 different indigenous groups, as well as 10% of the planet's biodiversity, WWF said. The report was presented at the 27th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which brings together representatives of most of the world's governments in this seaside resort town on the shores of the Red Sea. One of the consequences of the loss of the Amazon biome is that it would make impossible a central objective of the climate summits, that of keeping the increase in global temperature below 1.5 degrees Celsius in relation to the pre-industrial era. That goal cannot be met, according to the report, if the Amazon rainforest is lost, since its vegetation and soils store between 367 and 733 gigatons of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas that warms the atmosphere. ""At the same time, the carbon stored for centuries in the Amazon is also being released at an accelerated rate due to deforestation, fires and unsustainable productive activities,"" the text added. WWF said that, joining the clamor of Amazonian indigenous organizations, it proposes ""a global effort to protect 80% of the Amazon by 2025,"" in transition to an ecologically healthy region. A month ago, a meeting of Amazonian indigenous organizations in Lima launched the 80×25 initiative to protect in principle 244 million hectares, an area larger than Algeria and almost as large as Argentina, whose biome is at risk because it does not have adequate protection status. ""Up to 20% of the forests have been destroyed, by an oil well, illegal mining, fires, logging, introduction of monocultures and cattle ranching,"" said Gregorio Díaz Mirabal, leader of the Coordinating Committee of Indigenous Organizations of the Amazon Basin, a Venezuelan indigenous Curripaco. He added that the indigenous peoples of the Amazon ""no longer want the forest area to fall below 80%, because it would be our destruction"". According to the Amazonian Network of Geo-referenced Socio-environmental Information (Red Amazónica de Información Socioambiental Georreferenciada), they are exposed to extractive activities because they do not have the protective status of protected areas or indigenous territories. WWF therefore proposed ""securing and expanding a mosaic of protected areas and protected indigenous territories,"" which ""must be governed and managed equitably, along with integrated landscape management approaches for conservation and sustainable development."" It also requires ""high-level political commitment that directly addresses the main drivers of Amazonian loss, such as deforestation, illegal mining, corruption, indiscriminate use of wildlife and other natural resources, and infrastructure planned without ecosystem considerations."" At COP27, the President of Colombia, Gustavo Petro, proposed ""saving the Amazon rainforest as a substantial part of an agenda to solve the climate crisis"", and proposed the creation of a new multilateral fund ""capable for 20 years of financing the social, peasant and agricultural forces"" present in the area. These groups, ""in general humble people, are today agents of destruction of the forest"", so according to Petro they should be ""transformed into a positive force, which means paying them monthly for environmental services, for taking care and letting the Amazon forest grow"". For this fund Colombia will have 200 million dollars a year, and Petro said that he has the support of neighboring Venezuela and hopes to obtain it from Brazil, which occupies more than 60% of the Amazon. The 80×25 initiative proposes legal recognition, demarcation and financing of indigenous peoples' territories, and to halt the advance of deforestation, especially that which is carried out illegally and on a commercial scale, in primary forests, of high biological value or in areas that are reaching local points of no return. Also, to promote a development model that stops the drivers of deforestation and degradation; to finance a large-scale ecological restoration program; and to protect biodiversity and endangered species. ""Meeting the 80×25 target is part of a global effort to establish a transition to an ecologically healthy Amazon, a shift towards social equity, inclusive economic development and global responsibility,"" summarized Kurt Holle, director of Amazon Coordination at WWF."

Between January and October, a total of 9,994 square kilometers of the world's largest tropical rainforest was cleared, the highest rate of deforestation since record-keeping began in 2015.  Deforestation in the rainforest in the first ten months of the year has already exceeded that of all of 2021, when 8,219 square kilometers was cleared, according to the monthly information recorded by the real-time deforestation detection (DETER) system.  Based on the information collected by DETER through satellite images, the INPE issues alerts about the areas being deforested in the Amazon.  A total of 4,586 deforestation alerts were issued in October.  Under right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro's leadership in the last four years, deforestation in the Amazon rainforest has skyrocketed to levels not seen since 2008.

2022-11-14,Deforestation In Brazil's Amazon Hits Record High In October,472,"Nov 14, 2022( Latin Times: http://www.latintimes.com Delivered by Newstex)   The deforestation statistics in Brazil's Amazon rainforest reached a record high in October after 903.86 square kilometers (348.98 square miles) were cleared in the region last month.  According to the preliminary government satellite data collected by space research agency Inpe, about 903.86 square kilometers (348.98 square miles) were cleared in Brazil's Amazon region in October. This is the highest for the period since tracking began in 2015 and is up 3.1% year-on-year, Yahoo News [1]reported.  Meanwhile, from January to October of 2022, about 9,494 square kilometers were cleared in the Amazon. This is equal to an area more than 12 times the size of New York City. This also set a record for the amount of land cleared in Amazon in this period, exceeding the previous high set in 2019 by 12.7%.  Incoming leftist President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who will take over on Jan. 1 from far-right incumbent Jair Bolsonaro, has promised to curb deforestation in the Amazon by bolstering law enforcement, Al Jazeera[2] reported.  Bolsonaro reportedly rolled back environmental protections during his time in office and pushed for more mining and other development projects in the Amazon, saying they would stimulate the economy. The rainforest saw years of increased deforestation under the administration of outgoing President Jair Bolsonaro.  Annual statistics that were released last year showed that deforestation had already surged to a 15-year high under Bolsonaro.  Meanwhile, Lula, in a victory speech after defeating Bolsonaro, said that Brazil was 'ready to resume its leading role in the fight against the climate crisis.' He also has pledged to 'fight for zero deforestation', especially by protecting the Amazon.  Meanwhile, the Brazilian branch of the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) said that the increase in Amazon deforestation in October was expected. However, they added that the preliminary data for the first days of November is terrifying.'  Mariana Napolitano, WWF-Brasil's science manager, said she already expected deforestation to spike during the transition period and highlighted how fire alerts have rocketed since the election was declared in Lula's favor on Oct. 30.  ""Those who profit from illegality noticed there is still an opportunity window opened but it's about to close. Those figures are really scary,"" she said.  The burning season in the Amazon usually occurs between August and September of every year. However, fire alerts in the Amazon in the first ten days of November have nearly matched those reported in all of that month in 2021.

Ecologists warn that the rainforest is reaching the 'point of no return'. RIO DE JANEIRO. The Brazilian Amazon lost 903.8 square kilometers of rainforest in October, 3% more than the same month last year and a new record for the period, according to deforestation alerts released this November 11, 2022 by the Brazilian Institute of Special Research (INPE). In the year's accumulated, the most extensive rainforest on the planet also beat a new historical mark with 9,994 square kilometers of native vegetation devastated, the highest rate since 2015 when the measurement began, according to deforestation alerts released by the National Institute of Space Research (Inpe).

2022-10-07,Deforestation in Brazilian Amazon reaches record high in September due to fires,474,"By Gabriel Araujo SAO PAULO, Oct 7 (Reuters) - Deforestation of Brazil's Amazon rainforest was the highest for a September since records began, government data showed on Friday for last month, when fires in the region soared to a decade high. Satellite data from Brazil's space research agency INPE showed that 1,455 square kilometers were cleared in the Amazon last month, up 48% from a year ago and more than the September 2019 record for a data series dating back to 2015 Friday's preliminary figures also showed record deforestation for the first nine months of the year, according to INPE, with 8,590 square kilometers from January to September, equivalent to an area 11 times the size of New York City and a 22.6% increase over last year. Annual statistics released last year showed that deforestation had already soared to a 15-year high during President Jair Bolsonaro's administration. Experts blame the far-right leader, who is currently running for re-election, for rolling back environmental protections, opening the way for loggers and ranchers to illegally log more of the Amazon. Bolsonaro's office referred a Reuters request for comment to the Justice Ministry, which said it has been conducting a police operation since last year to combat illegal deforestation and forest fires and to protect indigenous lands. The Environment Ministry did not respond to a request for comment. The acceleration of deforestation had ""quite relevant impacts not only for the biome, but also for the region's climate and rainfall regime, as well as economic impacts for those living in the Amazon and in Brazil as a whole,"" said Mariana Napolitano, science manager for WWF-Brazil. The annual fire season in the Amazon occurs in August and September, when fires tend to increase due to less rainfall, allowing ranchers and farmers to burn areas for deforestation. Last month, INPE fire alerts reached the highest monthly level since September 2010. (Reporting by Gabriel Araujo and Peter Frontini Edited in Spanish by Javier López de Lérida)"

2022-11-30,Deforestation in the Amazon declines for the first time in Bolsonaro's administration,476,"Rio de Janeiro, Nov. 30. The Brazilian Amazon lost 11,568 kilometers of vegetation cover between August 2021 and July 2022, an extension 11.3% less than that devastated in the immediately preceding year, thus deforestation recorded its first reduction since the arrival to power of Jair Bolsonaro. According to data released Wednesday by the National Institute for Space Research (INPE), deforestation in the last year was the second highest in the last 14 years, surpassed only by that of the 2020-2021 period (13,038 square kilometers). The data disclosed are from the Amazon Deforestation Satellite Monitoring Project (Prodes), a tool that measures annual devastation by analyzing satellite images and has a much higher degree of confidence than the Deter system, which INPE uses to measure logging on a monthly basis. According to calculations by the Climate Observatory, a network that brings together several environmental groups, including international ones such as Greenpeace and WWF, the average deforestation in Bolsonaro's four-year term was 11,396 square kilometers per year, with a 59.5% jump compared to the previous four years. According to this network, despite the reduction in the last year, deforestation rates remain very high, especially at a time when scientists warn that the destruction of the Amazon is reaching a point of no return. Environmentalists attribute the increased devastation of the world's largest rainforest to the anti-environmentalist rhetoric of the far-right leader, who dismantled oversight agencies, relaxed legislation and defended the economic exploitation of the Amazon even in indigenous reserves. Deforestation fell from an average of 21,617 kilometers per year in Lula's first government (2003-2006), when the progressive leader began to adopt environmental protection measures, to 5,473 kilometers per year in Dilma Rousseff's first term (2011-2014), but grew in Michel Temer's administration (2016-2018) and skyrocketed in Bolsonaro's. The Climate Observatory stated that the international community's criticism of Bolsonaro's management of the Amazon forced INPE to postpone until Wednesday the release of the report, which was ready before the start of the COP27 climate conference, which ended on November 20 in Egypt. The executive secretary of the Climate Observatory, Márcio Astrini, warned that the data released Wednesday do not take into account the deforestation of the last five months of Bolsonaro's term, in which record rates of devastation are being recorded. ""The most recent numbers indicate that logging continues out of control. Bolsonaro will leave his successor a cursed inheritance. If he wants to reduce deforestation, Lula will need a zero-tolerance policy towards logging,"" said Astrini. EFE cm/mp/szg"
2022-11-13,Deforestation in the Amazon does not stop and in 2022 it is already higher than last year,477,"The Brazilian Institute of Special Research (INPE) reported that the Brazilian Amazon lost 903.8 square kilometers of rainforest during the month of October, 3% more than in the same period last year. According to the INPE alert, this figure sets a new negative record for October, including the 4,586 deforestation warnings sent by the satellite system that supports these analyses in real time. In the first 10 months of 2022, INPE indicates, the accumulated record was also broken with 9,994 square kilometers of native vegetation razed, the highest rate since this caption began to be measured in 2015. The devastation of the Amazon rainforest up to October already exceeds that of the entire 2021, when 8,219 square kilometers were affected, the alert adds. ""The moment is crucial for the Amazon, because the world's climate depends on it and, consequently, the economy, agriculture and the health of all the inhabitants of this planet. We need to leave the realm of promises and move on to real action,"" said André Freitas, representative of Greenpeace Brazil, in a statement on the data. In this sense, environmental organizations around the world warn that the rate of deforestation of the Brazilian Amazon will lead to the threshold of no return. Analysts have pointed out the coincidence of this dismal trend of environmental destruction with the mandate of President Jair Bolsonaro during the last four years, at unprecedented levels. In this context, Brazil's former Minister of the Environment, Marina Silva, assured this week at the Climate Summit in Egypt that,in the government of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, the preservation of the Amazon will be a priority of the administration that will begin on January 1, 2023. Brazil will protect the Amazon ""with its own efforts"" and will not make it conditional on the receipt of international funds, she affirmed this Saturday at COP27. She also announced that to define and implement policies it will work in an inter-ministerial manner. Lula's ally acknowledged that there is an urgent task in recomposing the budgets allocated to the preservation of the Amazon, cut by the Bolsonaro government, and also the teams specialized in conservation. ""It is not something difficult, it will be necessary to replace inadequate people, military men who do not know about the environment"", with ""technical teams"" capable of doing their job and that are ""threatened and besieged by the current government"", she explained."
2022-11-30,"Deforestation in the Amazon drops 11%, but remains above 10 thousand square kilometers",478,"For the fourth consecutive year, deforestation in the Amazon, in one year, exceeded 10 thousand km². The data from the Prodes program, from Inpe (National Institute for Space Research), released on Wednesday (30), show that 11,568 km² of forest were cut down from August 2021 to July 2022. The figure, however, is about 11% lower than the previous year's rate and interrupts a sequence of growth that had been going on since 2018. In any case, the numbers remain high, especially when considering the warnings that the Amazon is not far from a point of no return, in which, due to deforestation, the forest could undergo savannization, with the loss of its biodiversity and ecosystem services. The situation is even more critical if we consider the advancing climate crisis, which makes more and more explicit the extreme events that will be experienced even more frequently by the world's population. Containing deforestation, especially in the Amazon, is central to Brazil's role in the climate crisis, considering that forest clearing is the main source of greenhouse gas emissions in the country. In addition, the explosive deforestation that occurred under the government of Jair Bolsonaro (PL), has been causing problems for the Brazilian international image, which consequently leads to greater commercial difficulties and loss of partnerships - the maximum example was the paralysis of the billionaire Amazon Fund. Since before the beginning of his administration, Bolsonaro has questioned deforestation and fire data produced by Inpe, a government agency. He has also publicly criticized actions to combat deforestation. The Prodes data show that, again, the states with the highest deforestation rates were Pará, Amazonas, Mato Grosso and Rondônia, which account for almost 88% of the documented deforestation. Amazonas, thus, for the second consecutive year, occupies the second position in the devastation ranking, which until 2020 was occupied by Mato Grosso. The advance of deforestation in the state is a cause for attention and concern, considering the still large and well-conserved areas in the region. In fact, from August 2021 to July 2022, Amazonas was the only state to register an increase in deforestation in relation to the previous Prodes. The growth was about 13%. Pará and Mato Grosso, the other states that complete the top three deforestation states, had reductions of, respectively, almost 21% and about 14%. Despite only being released this Wednesday, according to Folha's research, the MCTI (Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation) had already received the data before the COP27, the UN climate conference, which ended on November 20. During the event, the reporter even asked Environment Minister Joaquim Leite about the Prodes data. His answer was: ""I have no idea"". The technical note published by Inpe on Wednesday has the date of November 3 registered, that is, even before the beginning of COP27. During the COP27, Brazil's official booth kept its distance from the Amazon and tried to spread the idea that Brazil is a green energy country - which is true, in general terms, even though the energy matrix has been a little dirtier after the boost given to coal-fired thermoelectric plants. In the midst of the climate crisis and its devastating effects, Leite used his speech at the climate conference to say that he does not believe in an ""extremely forced reduction of emissions, via taxes and costs to various economic sectors, with the risk of generating green inflation and increasing poverty. The minister was also absent from the negotiations. This is not the first time that Jair Bolsonaro's government avoids disclosing deforestation data at a COP on climate - a tradition that has been maintained since 2005 by Brazilian governments. In 2021, the Minister of the Environment, Joaquim Leite, defended during the COP26 (held in Scotland) that deforestation in the Amazon was showing a downward trend, using data from the last months of Deter (Deforestation Detection System in Real Time). Although the annual data from Prodes had been available since October 27 of that year, the government only revealed the result after a note from SindCT (the union of federal public servants in the aerospace sector) stated that the information had been available for almost a month. The Planet in Transe project is supported by the Open Society Foundations."
2022-12-09,Deforestation in the Amazon drops from the previous year,479,"SAO PAULO, Dec 1 (ANSA) - The Amazon had a deforestation of 11,568km² between August 2021 and July 2022, a drop of 11% compared to the same period between 2020 and 2021, reported the National Institute for Space Research (Inpe) on Wednesday (30).  The data are based on the Project for Monitoring Deforestation in the Legal Amazon by Satellite (Prodes) and were ready since early November, but the government of Jair Bolsonaro delayed the release. The numbers are more accurate than the Real-Time Deforestation Detection System (Deter), which uses alerts and releases them monthly.  Despite the drop, the four years of Bolsonaro's administration saw a 59.5% expansion in Amazon deforestation, according to the NGO Observatório do Clima. The current president took the annual average of destruction at 7,145km² and hands over the government with 11,396km².  ""The Bolsonaro regime has been a forest destruction machine. The only good news from the current government is its end,"" said Marcio Astrini, the NGO's executive secretary, in a statement.  The representative also points out that Deter indicates ""that devastation continues out of control. ""Jair Bolsonaro will leave his successor a cursed legacy of increasing deforestation and a conflagrated Amazon. If he wants to see forest destruction numbers decrease by 2023, Lula will have to have zero tolerance for environmental crime from the first day of his government,"" he adds.  According to the Deter data, between August and October this year - months that will only be entered via Prodes in 2023 - there is a 45% increase in the area of deforestation alerts in comparison with the previous year.  The NGO also made a table to compare the presidents and the relation of decrease or increase in the deforestation rate. In Fernando Henrique Cardoso's governments (1995-2002), there was a 42.5% increase in the rate in the first four years (19,457km² annual average) and a 3.2% decrease in the second (18,825km²).  During the governments of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (2003-2010), there was a high of 14.8% in the comparison of the first mandate with the last one of FHC (21,617km²) and a strong retraction of 54.8% in the second (9,756km²).  Dilma Rousseff maintained the downward trajectory in her first term (2011-2014), with -43.9% of deforested area, which represents 5,473km². In the two years before the impeachment (compared to the two previous years), there was a rise of 29.3% (7,050km²). In the two years of Michel Temer (2017-2018), the rise was 2.7% with an annual average of 7,241km², bringing the average in the period 2015-2018 to 7,145km².(ANSA). "
2022-11-30,"Deforestation in the Amazon falls 11% in one year, but the Bolsonaro administration has seen an increase of 59.5%.",480," Deforestation in the Amazon between August 2021 and July this year reached 11,568 km², according to data from the National Institute for Space Research (Inpe), an agency linked to the Ministry of Science and Technology. The drop is 11% compared to the same period last year. The four years of the Jair Bolsonaro (PL) administration, however, saw an increase of 59.5% in destruction, compared to the previous four years, during the Dilma Rousseff (PT) and Michel Temer (MDB) administrations, according to a calculation made by the Climate Observatory based on official data. Bolsonaro has been the target of criticism in Brazil and abroad for weakening the inspection and punishment bodies for environmental crimes. It is the highest percentage increase in a presidential term since satellite measurements began in 1988. Bolsonaro surpassed even the high seen in the first Fernando Henrique Cardoso administration, when the heating up of the economy at the beginning of the Real Plan caused the largest deforestation in the historical series, of 29,000 km², in 1995. The annual average under Bolsonaro was 11,396 km², compared to 7,145 km² in the previous period (2015-2018). The States of Pará, Amazonas, Mato Grosso and Rondônia correspond to 87.89% of the deforestation estimated by the Program for Monitoring the Brazilian Amazon Forest by Satellite (Prodes), of Inpe. The data for 2022 reveal an explosion of deforestation in Amazonas, the only state with an increase in clear cuts this year. A total of 2,607 km² were cut down, an increase of 13% in relation to 2021. Pará, even with a 21% reduction, still leads the ranking, with 4,141 km² lost in 2022. Prodes considers as deforestation the complete removal of primary forest cover by clear cutting or the final stage of a progressive degradation of the forest in which there is a complete loss of the canopy, regardless of the future use of these areas. Prodes is responsible for the official deforestation balances. According to Marcio Astrini, from the Climate Observatory, ""the only good news from the current government is its end"". At the Climate Summit held this month in Egypt, the COP-27, the president-elect Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (PT) promised zero deforestation as one of the goals of the new administration. The international community's expectation is that Brazil will turn around its environmental policy in the next few years. The technical team of the elected government is working with a list of priorities in the environmental area, in an attempt to stanch the short-term effects of measures taken by the Bolsonaro government. A crucial point of this work, according to Estadão, is to adopt measures to suspend the current rules for environmental fines, which have allowed the prescription of thousands of violations committed throughout the country."
2022-11-09,"Deforestation In The Amazon Is Accelerating The Point Of No Return, Warns WWF",481,"(TNSrpt) -- WWF Global issued the following news release: WWF's Living Amazon Report, published today, argues that threats to the integrity of the Amazon must be stopped through urgent measures to protect 80% of the rainforest by 2025 (80x25). Drawing on the latest available research, the report shows that without urgent action, the rainforest could reach a point of no return, directly affecting the livelihoods of the 47 million people living in the Amazon, 511 indigenous peoples groups, 10% of the planet's biodiversity, and aggravating the global climate and biodiversity crises. Despite the stark warnings that the Amazon faced this point of no return from the Science Panel for the Amazon (SPA) at COP 26, a year on, deforestation is accelerating rather than decreasing. The Panel's data shows that 18% of Amazon forests have been converted to other uses and an additional 17% are highly degraded. The report also warns that the vital goal of keeping global warming to 1.5 C cannot be met if the Amazon Rainforest is lost, as it stores between 367 - 733 Gt of CO2 in its vegetation and soils. At the same time, the carbon stored for centuries in the Amazon is also being released at an accelerated rate due to deforestation, fires, and unsustainable production activities. Reversing this trend, and protecting 80% of the rainforest, will require securing and extending a mosaic of protected areas and protected indigenous territories - currently half of the forest - which must be equitably governed and managed, along with integrated landscape management approaches for conservation and sustainable development, according to WWF. The report argues that saving the Amazon will also require a high-level political commitment that directly addresses the main drivers of Amazon loss such as deforestation, illegal mining, corruption, indiscriminate use of fauna and other natural resources, and infrastructure planned without ecosystem considerations. ""Meeting the 80x25 goal is part of a global effort to transition to an ecologically healthy Amazon. This requires a shift towards social equity, inclusive economic development, and global responsibility"" remarked Kurt Holle, WWF's Amazon Coordination Unit/ Peru Director. In the context of global environmental change, ""the Amazon is caught in the intersection between the climate and biodiversity crises, with the destruction of its ecosystems diminishing the possibility of limiting temperature increase to 1.5 C"" said Roberto Troya, Regional Director for WWF Latin America and the Caribbean, adding that ""urgent action is needed to avoid global repercussions and to ensure that this region can continue to regulate the planet's climate and to provide environmental and cultural benefits to the world"". During an event at COP27 launching the report, a global call for key stakeholders from diverse sectors to join the Coordinator of Indigenous Organizations of the Amazon Basin (COICA)'s 80x25 initiative to protect at least 80% of the Amazon was issued. According to the group, accomplishing this goal will require: a regional Pan-Amazonian vision with strengthened policies and institutions to implement it; 100% legal recognition, demarcation, and financing of indigenous peoples' territories; moratoria or other policies for halting deforestation, in particular, that which is carried out illegally and at a commercial scale, in primary forests, areas of high biological value, or areas that are already reaching local tipping points; foster a development model that stops the drivers of deforestation and degradation, and promotes deforestation-free supply chains; finance a large-scale ecological restoration program; protect biodiversity and threatened species, among other strategies. * * * REPORT: https://wwfint.awsassets.panda.org/img/original/lar2022_eng_digital.pdf * * * Original text here: https://wwf.panda.org/wwf_news/press_releases/?6794391/Deforestation-in-the-Amazon-is-accelerating-the-point-of-no-return-warns-WWF [Category: Environment] Copyright Targeted News Services C22-SUharpal-7993226 C22-SUharpal"
2022-11-04,Deforestation in the Amazon reaches the 3rd highest mark for the month of October,482,"As has been the case since the beginning of 2022, the Amazon saw significant deforestation in October. The 813.2 km² of forest felled is the third highest value for the recent history of Deter, a program of Inpe (National Institute for Space Research), which began in 2015. The rate of deforestation last month should still increase, however, considering that the data from Inpe only received updates until October 28. The number comes to light on the eve of COP27, the UN (United Nations) conference on climate change, in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. Once again, deforestation will be a sensitive issue for the Jair Bolsonaro (PL) government at the conference -which should try, when possible, to avoid the subject and focus on Brazil as a green energy country. Also expected soon is the release of the Prodes deforestation rate, the Inpe program that measures the annual deforestation in the biome. Last year, the Prodes data were already available during the COP26, but were only released by the Bolsonaro government after the event. The Deter does not have the objective of measuring deforestation, but rather of assisting public policies to combat deforestation. However, from its data it is possible to observe destruction trends. Since the beginning of 2022, at least, the monthly deforestation data indicated by Deter have been high and, in several cases, the highest in recent history for a given month. January, February, April, June, and September were records, for example. August was just below the record for 2019, the first year of the Bolsonaro government. It is worth mentioning that all of the highest monthly deforestation numbers recorded by Deter occurred under Bolsonaro's administration. The recent historical data starts in 2015, when there was an update in the sensors of the Deter program that makes it impossible to make a proper comparison with previous years, where there was a lower accuracy. Bolsonaro, since the beginning of his government, has minimized the importance of deforestation data and even accused Inpe of being at the service of other interests. One such instance of accusations without proof led to the exoneration of Ricardo Galvão. At the time, the president had claimed that Inpe's data did not correspond to the truth and suggested that Galvão might be at the ""service of some NGO."" Ricardo Galvão, who ran for federal deputy in the last election but was not elected, responded to the attacks. Despite previously criticizing Inpe data and claiming that most of the Amazon is untouched -which is false-, during the debates for the presidential election, Bolsonaro used such data to claim that deforestation and burning was higher during previous governments. The statement is not false, but lacks context. While other governments generally received a situation with higher deforestation, there were actions that brought down the levels of destruction. Meanwhile, during the Bolsonaro government, the country saw deforestation levels explode and exceed more than 10 thousand km² of destroyed forest per year."
2022-10-07,Deforestation in the Amazon sets a new record for the month of September,483," The deforested area in the Amazon in September was the largest since the beginning of the historical series in 2016, with a record 1,455km², 48% higher than the mark in September last year, 985km². The data are from the Deter system, of the Institute for Space Research (Inpe), released on Friday (7). The survey also shows that from January 1st to September 30th deforestation alerts were registered for 8,590km². This represents deforestation 23% above that recorded in the same period last year, 7,006km², and more than double the 2018 figure, 4,081km². In September, alerts were concentrated in the states of Pará (36%), Mato Grosso (23%), Amazonas (20%) and Rondônia (11%). The most deforested municipalities in September were União do Sul (MT), with 111km², Lábrea (AM), with 83km² and São Félix do Xingu (PA), with 72km². For Mariana Napolitano, WWF-Brazil's Science Manager, deforestation in the Amazon is growing at an exponential rate, with ""serious consequences"" for the country, since environmental destruction impacts on aspects such as rainfall and food production. ""The deforestation rate in the first nine months of 2022 doubled between 2018 and 2020, going from 4,000 km² to more than 8,000 km² - it is an unprecedented growth,"" he said. Cristiane Mazzetti, Greenpeace Brazil's Amazon spokesperson, defends better proposals for the environmental agenda, since, according to her, the government has acted improperly in protecting the Amazon. ""This has resulted in an increase in CO2 emissions and many losses for our country: in three years, an area equivalent to one and a half times the state of Sergipe, was deforested in the Amazon. In addition, many indigenous lives have been lost as a result of increased invasions on their lands. This project of destruction cannot continue,"" said Mazzetti. ""If government policy continues to allow and encourage the rapid deforestation of the forest, we will seriously compromise our future. Therefore, Brazilians should think deeply about their choice in the second round and vote for the climate, for the forests, and for the future of Brazil. To continue with the current policy is to accelerate the collapse of the Amazon instead of using the little time we have to avoid it. If it continues like this, the Amazon has no chance"", he added. Cerrado In September, 262km² were devastated. It is the lowest value since 2020, but even so the accumulated deforestation in the year already reaches 4,837km², a value 24% higher than the one registered in 2021, according to the Deter System. From a regional perspective, deforestation in the Cerrado was once again concentrated in the MATOPIBA states in 2021: Bahia, with 1,228km², Maranhão with 1,166km², and Tocantins, 752km².

2022-10-06,Deforestation in the Amazon under Bolsonaro's administration is equivalent to the area of the state of RJ,484,"President Jair Bolsonaro (PL), who is seeking reelection, is expected to end his four years in office with a total of 47,000 km² of deforestation in the Amazon. The number represents the total area destroyed according to estimates by the National Institute for Space Research (Inpe) between 2019 and 2022 and is 60% greater than that recorded in the previous four years in the Dilma Rousseff (PT) and Michel Temer (MDB) governments. The area deforested in the Bolsonaro administration is larger than the entire state of Rio de Janeiro, for example, with its 43 thousand km². If this damage is compared with the extension of the city of São Paulo, it is equivalent to saying that, during the government of the current president, an area of forest equivalent to the São Paulo capital was deforested every 45 days. . This year, according to the specialists, an extremely conservative projection indicates at least another 12 thousand km² of cuttings, but the indications are that this volume for 2022 should be close to 15 thousand km². These numbers are outside the historical curve. Inpe data indicate that in the previous four years, from 2015 to 2018, the total volume of deforestation in the Amazon reached 28,583 km². The report questioned the Ministry of Environment (MMA) about the deforestation data, but the portfolio said it would not comment because the question must be answered by the Justice portfolio. Federal agencies for combating deforestation, such as Ibama and the Chico Mendes Institute (ICMBio), are directly linked to the Ministry of Environment. Operation Guardians of the Biome, which combats environmental crimes, is coordinated by the Ministry of Justice. The action - which brings together agents of the National Force, Ibama and ICMBio - was only launched in July 2021, two and a half years after Bolsonaro reached the Planalto Palace. Also questioned by the report, the Ministry of Justice did not respond. The legal consultant of the Socio-environmental Institute (ISA), Mauricio Guetta, says that the data expose the way the Bolsonaro administration has always faced the environmental area. ""Since the first day of 2019, the government has systematically encouraged environmental crime and dismantled all public policies and institutions for environmental protection. The result is the uncontrolled deforestation and other illegal activities, such as mining on indigenous lands, in addition to the failure to meet climate targets,"" he says. Professor of Environmental Law, Guetta also calls attention to the external damage that these numbers produce to the economy and image of Brazil. ""The damage is irreparable, not only in the environmental and social spheres, but also in the economic sphere, with loss of investment and international credibility. For Marcio Astrini, executive secretary of the Climate Observatory, there is a possibility that the ""tragedy will increase even more"" since Bolsonaro, if re-elected, has not signaled for a change in forest preservation policies. The network is formed by 68 Brazilian civil society organizations that work on the socio-environmental and climate agenda. Carbon emissions have doubled in the Amazon A study conducted by 30 Brazilian scientists and released on Wednesday, 5 by the Climate Observatory shows that record deforestation and fires in the first two years of the Bolsonaro government caused an 89% increase in carbon gas emissions in 2019 and 122% in 2020, compared to the annual average recorded between 2010 and 2018. The study, coordinated by Inpe researcher Luciana Gatti, points out that in 2019 the increase in emissions was the result of the 79% increase in deforestation and 14% increase in the area burned in the Amazon, compared to the average of the nine years preceding the current government. In the first year of Bolsonaro's administration, the environmental fines levied fell by 30%. The drop in the fines paid was even greater, 74%. In 2020, when CO2 emissions more than doubled, deforestation rose 74% and the area burned increased 42%. The fines levied dropped 54%, while the fines paid dropped 89%.

2022-10-08,Deforestation In The Amazon Worse Than Ever For September Ahead Of Brazilian Elections,485,"Greenpeace UK posted the following news release: An area of the Amazon almost twice the size of New York City was deforested in September, according to alerts from the Brazilian Space Research Institute (INPE)'s system DETER. 1,455 km2 is the largest area ever recorded for the month of September. The data shows an increase of 48% compared to the same month last year. 2022 has seen record-breaking numbers of fires and deforestation. From January to September, 8,590 km(2) of the Amazon was deforested (11 times the size of NYC). And in the past three years, an area larger than Belgium was deforested in the Amazon according to the official government database PRODES. Cristiane Mazzetti, spokesperson for Greenpeace Brazil, said: ""In recent years, the Bolsonaro government has shown complete disregard for a safe climate and for the Amazon rainforest, Indigenous Peoples and traditional communities. His administration has actively promoted an anti-environment, anti-Indigenous and anti-democratic agenda that has resulted in a severe increase in carbon emissions and that paints a grave scenario in Brazil. This destructive project cannot continue."" Paul Morozzo, senior food and forests campaigner at Greenpeace UK, said: ""Bolsonaro has allowed and in fact encouraged catastrophic levels of deforestation in the Amazon and other climate-critical Brazilian forests. His administration has also lobbied the UK and EU to try and block crucial legislation that could stop deforestation-linked products entering our markets. ""The Brazilian elections are not just about the future of Brazil, the result will have an impact on all of humanity. If we lose the Amazon, we lose the fight against the climate crisis."" By emboldening forest destruction, the Brazilian government's actions have also caused an increase in violence in the field against Indigeneous Peoples and environmental defenders. According to a report published by NGO CIMI, 176 Indigenous People were murdered in 2021. Brazil is one of the most dangerous countries for environmentalists, according to a report by Global Witness. Over 17% of the entire Amazon Basin has already been deforested, and this massive destruction is pushing the forest closer to a tipping point. If 20 to 25% of the Amazon is lost, it would fail as an ecosystem, according to a research by scientists Carlos Nobre and Thomas Lovejoy. The high deforestation rate in Brazil has caused the country's carbon emissions to increase. Some 46% of the country's emissions come from deforestation. * * * Original text here: https://www.greenpeace.org.uk/news/deforestation-in-the-amazon-worse-than-ever-for-september-ahead-of-brazilian-elections/ [Category: Environment] Copyright Targeted News Services MSTRUCK-7966982 MSTRUCK"
2022-11-12,Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon breaks record in October and exceeds all of 2021,486,"The Brazilian Amazon lost 903.8 square kilometers of rainforest in October, 3% more than the same month last year and a new record for the period, according to deforestation alerts released Friday by the Brazilian Institute of Special Research (INPE). In the accumulated of the year, the most extensive rainforest on the planet also beat a new historical mark with 9,994 square kilometers of native vegetation devastated, the highest rate since 2015 when the measurement began, according to deforestation alerts released by the National Institute of Space Research (Inpe). According to the information recorded monthly by the Real-Time Legal Amazon Deforestation Detection System (Deter), the devastation of the rainforest in the first ten months of the year already exceeded that of the entire 2021, when 8,219 square kilometers of vegetation were razed. The methodology used in Deter is based on satellite images and INPE uses it to provide early warnings about areas being deforested in the Amazon. In October, 4,586 deforestation warnings were sent by the system. In the last four years, coinciding with the arrival of President Jair Bolsonar to power, deforestation in the Amazon rainforest has soared to levels not seen since 2008. Environmental organizations have warned that rampant deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon is pushing the rainforest to a point of no return. ""The moment is crucial for the Amazon, because the world's climate depends on it and, consequently, the economy, agriculture and the health of all the inhabitants of this planet. We need to get out of the realm of promises and move on to real action,"" said André Freitas, of Greenpeace Brazil, in a statement."
2022-10-07,Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon reaches record high for September,487,"Deforestation in Brazil's Amazon was the highest for a September since records began, government data from last month showed Friday, as fires in the region soared to a decade high. Satellite data from Brazil's space research agency INPE showed that 1,455 square kilometers were cleared in the Amazon last month.  Bolsonaro's responsibility  The area cleared last month in the planet's largest rainforest is 48% larger than it was in September 2021, according to data from the DETER satellite monitoring system, from the National Institute for Space Research (INPE), whose series begins in 2015. And it narrowly beats the previous record for the month of September (1,454 km2), recorded in 2019. Friday's preliminary figures also showed record deforestation for the first nine months of the year, according to INPE, with 8,590 square kilometers from January to September, equivalent to an area 11 times the size of New York City and a 22.6% increase over last year. ""The area of deforestation alerts is already 4.5% higher than that verified in all of 2021 and may equal or surpass in the three remaining months the historical record of 2019 (9,178 km2),"" the NGO Observatório do Clima said in a statement. Annual statistics released last year showed that deforestation had already soared to a 15-year high during President Jair Bolsonaro's administration. Experts blame the far-right leader, who is currently running for re-election, for rolling back environmental protections, opening the way for loggers and ranchers to illegally log more of the Amazon. During the tenure of Bolsonaro, a former Army captain, average annual deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon increased 75% compared to the previous decade. Brazil's Justice Ministry told Reuters that it has been running a police operation since last year to combat illegal deforestation and forest fires and to protect indigenous lands. ""Anyone who cares about the future of the rainforest, the lives of indigenous peoples and the possibility of having a livable planet should vote to remove Bolsonaro from the presidency on Oct. 30,"" the Observatory's executive secretary, Marcio Astrini, said in a statement. The leftist Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva won in the first round of the elections with 48% of the votes, against 43% obtained by Bolsonaro, a result that forced a runoff election. Former president Lula (2003-2010), whose environmental record is also a target of criticism, promised to increase the greenhouse gas reduction targets agreed by Brazil in the Paris Agreement, reactivate the Amazon Fund for international financing to protect the rainforest and combat deforestation, among other measures. Bolsonaro's campaign defends the legacy of the current head of state, claiming that it ""balances environmental protection with fair and sustainable economic growth.""   Impacts of deforestation The acceleration of deforestation had ""quite relevant impacts not only for the biome, but also for the region's climate and rainfall regime, as well as economic impacts for those who live in the Amazon and in Brazil as a whole,"" said Mariana Napolitano, scientific manager of WWF-Brazil. The annual fire season in the Amazon occurs in August and September, when fires tend to increase due to less rainfall, allowing ranchers and farmers to burn areas for deforestation. Last month, INPE fire alerts reached the highest monthly level since September 2010. With information from AFP and Reuters "
2022-11-11,Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon reaches record high in October ahead of government changeover,488,"By Gabriel Araujo SAO PAULO, Nov 11 (Reuters) - Deforestation in Brazil's Amazon rainforest hit a record high in October, according to data released on Friday, with land clearing in the region accelerating as the country awaits the inauguration of a more conservation-friendly government. Preliminary government data collected by space research agency Inpe showed 903.86 square kilometers were cleared in the region last month, the highest for the period since tracking began in 2015 and an increase of 3.1% year-on-year. From January to October, 9,494 square kilometers were cleared, equivalent to an area more than 12 times the size of New York City and also a record for the period, surpassing the previous high set in 2019 by 12.7%. Incoming President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has vowed to curb deforestation in the Amazon by strengthening law enforcement. He will take office on January 1 from Jair Bolsonaro, the far-right leader who has scaled back environmental protection during his term in office. Annual statistics released last year showed that deforestation had already increased to a 15-year high during Bolsonaro's term. His office and the Environment Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Mariana Napolitano, WWF-Brazil's science manager, said she expected deforestation to skyrocket during the transition period, noting how fire alerts have risen since Lula's Oct. 30 win. ""Those who profit from illegality realized that there is still a window of opportunity open, but it is about to close. Those figures are really frightening,"" he said. Fire alerts in the first 10 days of November have nearly equaled those reported for that entire month in 2021, Inpe data showed. Fire season in the Amazon, when rainfall decreases, usually occurs between August and September. (Report by Gabriel Araujo; Edited in Spanish by Javier Leira)"
2022-11-30,Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon recedes from a 15-year high,489,"By Jake Spring SAO PAULO, Nov 30 (Reuters) - Deforestation in Brazil's Amazon rainforest declined in the 12 months to July, according to government data released on Wednesday, retreating from a 15-year high it reached under outgoing President Jair Bolsonaro. Destruction was down 11% from a year earlier to 11,568 square kilometers, according to annual data from Brazilian space research agency Inpe. However, the figure is still higher than any year from 2009 to 2020. ""It's better to have a lower figure than a higher one, but it's still a very high figure, the second highest in 13 years,"" said Marcio Astrini, director of the environmental advocacy group Climate Observatory. The Amazon, the world's largest rainforest, absorbs large amounts of carbon dioxide, a gas that contributes to global warming and is released into the atmosphere through deforestation. Ane Alencar, scientific director of the Amazon Environmental Research Institute, said there has been no change in Bolsonaro's policy of weakening environmental agencies to explain the drop in deforestation. Alencar and Astrini said it was impossible to immediately know why deforestation fell, commenting that perhaps climate or economic cycles could be a factor. The annual measurement of deforestation produced by Inpe's PRODES satellite monitoring program is much more accurate than its DETER early warning system, which publishes weekly data. Forest destruction is Brazil's largest source of greenhouse gas emissions. The PRODES report, released Wednesday, is the benchmark for measuring whether Brazil is meeting its environmental and climate commitments. Average deforestation in Bolsonaro's last four years is about 60% higher than in the previous four years. Bolsonaro's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. ""We are already seeing the consequences of deforestation. There's more drought, shorter rainy seasons, an increase in fires, an increase in temperatures,"" said Mariana Napolitano, scientific director of the nonprofit WWF-Brazil.

Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon, in just over nine months, already exceeded by 12.9% that of the entire 2021 and, without ending the year, is a new record for the country, the second under the government of the far-right Jair Bolsonaro, according to official data released Friday. Until October 21 this year, the most extensive rainforest on the planet had lost 9,277 square kilometers of native vegetation, the highest rate since 2015 when the measurement began, according to deforestation alerts released by the National Institute of Space Research (Inpe). The highest number of alerts so far had been recorded in 2019, during Bolsonaro's first year in office, when 9,178 square kilometers of forest were devastated. The data correspond to the Real-Time Legal Amazon Deforestation Detection System (Deter) which, based on satellite images, provides early warnings about areas being deforested in the Amazon. This system captures monthly deforestation alarms in Brazil and differs from Prodes, which, with a more sophisticated technique, obtains more detailed information, but only issues it annually, between August and July of the following year, considered the reference period for measuring devastation in the country. DEVASTATION ""OUT OF CONTROL For environmentalists, the issue is nothing new, since under the current government deforestation ""is absolutely out of control in the Amazon"", according to Marcio Astrini, executive secretary of the Climate Observatory, a network that brings together about 80 environmental NGOs in Brazil, including Greenpeace and WWF. ""There is no action by the federal government to curb deforestation in the Amazon. It is not a concern of the Bolsonaro government to reduce it,"" he said. For the expert, the problem is that environmental crimes in the rainforest have never had such a favorable scenario as the current one where there is ""much comfort"" for criminals. The Brazilian president defends the exploitation of natural resources in the Amazon, even in indigenous reserves, where it is prohibited by law, and since he came to power, the rates of devastation in the jungle have increased by 73%. NEGATIVE LEGACY The situation in which the Brazilian Amazon is immersed cannot be reversed in the short term and the governor who takes office in 2023 will have a ""very high"" negative legacy, according to Astrini, since he will inherit five months with very high deforestation rates (the reference year for measuring deforestation begins in August). ""In August we had an increase in alerts of 81%, in September of 48% and everything indicates that in October we are going to have the highest number in the historical series,"" Astrini indicated. Bolsonaro aspires to be reelected this Sunday in the second round, but former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is the favorite with 49 % of the voting intention, against 44 % of the ultra-right leader, according to the polls."
2022-11-30,"Deforestation in the Legal Amazon dropped 11% last year, says Inpe",493,"The Project for Monitoring Deforestation in the Legal Amazon by Satellite (Prodes), from the National Institute for Space Research (Inpe), which monitors annual deforestation rates in the Legal Amazon, indicated on Wednesday (30/11), that between 2021 and 2022 deforestation in the region fell 11%. The destruction in the area that includes the states of Acre, Amapá, Amazonas, Mato Grosso, Pará, Rondônia, Roraima, Tocantins and part of Maranhão went from 13038 km² last year to 11568 km². Among the states with the highest rate of felled forest this year, Pará has 4,141.00 km² of area with this profile, in the accumulated, since the beginning of monitoring, in 1988, this meant 34.61%. However, the deforestation rate in one year also registered a drop of 21%. Other locations also registered drops, the largest of which was in Amapá, which went from 17km² to six km² of area. In Tocantins the register went from 37km² to 27 km² of deforested area, the equivalent to a 27% decrease. In Roraima, the area went from 315 km² to 240 km², a reduction of 24%. Amazonas, the second federative unit of the Legal Amazon with the largest deforested area, from 2,607 km² in total in 2020, increased by 13% - the only state that registered growth. The rates are made available annually, with the first (about 50% of the processing) delivered in December, from the increments of satellite images that identify deforestation in the eight Brazilian states. In 2009, Brazil's National Plan on Climate Change stipulated a deforestation reduction target for 2020 of 3,925 km². However, the reality is that today deforestation is three times greater than what was agreed upon in the plan. Commitment to reduction  The area devastated in 2022 in the Amazon is 48.2% higher than the average observed in the last 10 years in the biome. Raul do Valle, Public Policy specialist at the World Wide Fund for Nature Brazil (WWF Brazil) calls attention to the dismantling of the environmental protection system that occurred under the administration of Jair Bolsonaro (PL) and how this could lead to the approach of a point of no return - that in which the forest loses the ability to provide ecosystem services. ""The new government needs to send a clear signal that no deforestation will be tolerated and to rebuild the entire framework of protection that has been destroyed. This path is vital for Brazil to guarantee its climate security and resume its leadership role in environmental issues on the international stage"", Valle evaluated. Marcelo Furtado, member of the Brazilian Coalition for Climate, Forests and Agriculture, reminds that this fight doesn't need to be invented, since there are already public policies that, when implemented, can significantly contain deforestation. He points out that besides the president, attention should also focus on the decisions that will come out of the National Congress. ""It's a shot in the foot. Who suffers most from this lack of responsibility is, on the one hand, the Brazilian citizen, who loses his environmental assets. Also the environment, which loses its capacity to generate water and climate control. And, obviously, the economy, because of the impact caused to agricultural production and energy generation,"" said the specialist."
2022-11-30,"Deforestation in the Legal Amazon fell last year, but rose 60% under Bolsonaro",494,"The deforested area in the Legal Amazon decreased 11% in 12 months, until July, according to official data released on Wednesday (30), which show, however, a total advance of 60% during the government of Jair Bolsonaro. Between August 2021 and July 2022, 11,568 km² of the rainforest were deforested, an area equivalent to the territory of Qatar, according to the Project for Monitoring Deforestation in the Legal Amazon by Satellite (Prodes), of the National Institute for Space Research (Inpe). This represents a drop of 11.3% with respect to the period from August 2020 to July 2021, when Inpe detected 13,083 km² deforested, a record in 15 years. But when considering the last four years, the data reveal that during Bolsonaro's government the average annual deforestation rose 59.5% compared to the previous four years. It also advanced 75.5 percent compared to the previous decade. ""The Bolsonaro regime has been a forest destruction machine (...) The only good news from the current government is its end,"" Marcio Astrini, executive secretary of the Climate Observatory, said in a statement. President-elect Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who beat Bolsonaro in the October elections, has promised to work to eliminate the destruction of the Amazon. ""The devastation continues out of control. Jair Bolsonaro will leave his successor a cursed legacy of rising deforestation and a conflagrated Amazon,"" Astrini added. The environmentalist called on Lula - whose legacy on the environment between 2003 and 2010 has been subject to criticism - to adopt a policy of ""zero tolerance"" for environmental crimes. Lula, who attended the UN climate conference in Egypt (COP27), promised to increase the greenhouse gas reduction targets agreed to by Brazil in the Paris Agreement, and to reactivate the internationally funded Amazon Fund, among other environmental measures. Experts attribute the deforestation mainly to the felling of trees to make room for pastures for cattle or agricultural crops. Bolsonaro is accused by environmentalists of having weakened protection programs and promoted destruction, with his defense of mining and economic exploitation of protected areas. The Amazon corresponds to 59% of Brazilian territory, divided among nine states. Its preservation is considered vital in the fight against climate change. ""The Amazon [is] getting closer and closer to its point of no return,"" Mariana Napolitano, Science Manager at WWF-Brazil, said in a statement. ""It is essential and feasible to significantly reduce deforestation rates until they are completely eliminated by 2030. This is a humanitarian imperative in the face of the dual climate crisis and the massive loss of global biodiversity that humanity is facing,"" she said."
2022-11-09,Deforestation is pushing Amazon to 'point of no return': WWF report,495,"Nov 09, 2022( Mongabay News: http://news.mongabay.com Delivered by Newstex)   A new report from the World Wildlife Fund, called the Living Amazon Report, warns that threats to the Amazon have gotten worse in recent years, and could result in the disappearance of the biome if more drastic action isn't taken.Around 18% of Amazon forests are lost and another 17% are highly degraded, the report said.If more drastic action isn't taken, the report said the biome could transition from forest to savanna and push global warming above the safe threshold of 1.5C. Deforestation is pushing the Amazon rainforest dangerously close to its tipping point, and the effects could soon be felt across the globe.  A new report[1] from the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), called the Living Amazon Report, warns that threats to the Amazon have worsened in recent years, and could result in the disappearance of the biome altogether if more drastic action isn't taken soon.  'The situation has begun to show signs of nearing a point of no return: seasons are changing, surface water is being lost, rivers are becoming increasingly disconnected and polluted, and forests are under immense pressure from increasingly devastating waves of deforestation and fire,' the report said. 'This could lead to irreversible change in the near future.'  The report was presented at COP27 in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, where the international community is discussing the implementation of policies to prevent climate change.  Cattle ranching, agriculture, land grabbing, fires and speculation have contributed to the loss of 18% of Amazon forests and the high degradation of another 17%, the report said. At the same time, pollution from mining and agriculture, and the introduction of non-native species are increasingly destabilizing the region's freshwater ecosystems.  There are currently more than 600 infrastructure projects operating along rivers in the Amazon, the report said, with twenty road projects being planned and over 400 dams operating or in the planning stage. Meanwhile, mining operations continue to clear forest and dump harmful chemicals like mercury into the water, the report said.  Around 12.2 million square kilometers (4.7 million square miles) of the rainforest were cleared last year, according to PRODES, a satellite project monitoring deforestation.  More frequent and intense fires in the Amazon threaten the stability of this key ecosystem for people, wildlife, and climate. Image by Christian Braga/ Greenpeace.  As a result, the biome is nearing its 'tipping point,' meaning it could soon transition from wet rainforest to dry savanna, and would become unable to sustain its current biodiversity. The Amazon region in Brazil and Bolivia is already showing clear signs of savannization, another recent report showed[2], with Colombia, Ecuador and Peru going in the same direction. Some studies say[3] the tipping point lies somewhere around 25% forest cover loss. But according to the WWF report, it could also be less than that.  'There is no scientific consensus on the exact probability of reaching a point of no return because we do not know enough about some complex ecosystem factors,' the report said. 'It is known, however, that the probability increases with greater deforestation, degradation and climate change.'  Reaching the tipping point could drastically alter the lives of the 47 million people who live and work in the Amazon region, the report said, among them more than 500 Indigenous groups. It would also have regional and even global implications, since the rainforest would be unable to serve its ecological function as a recycler of water and air pollution.  The Amazon recycles up to 75% of moisture. But if deforestation continues, there won't be enough forest left to carry out that function, leading to a drop in precipitation, an extended dry season and a water deficit.  That dryness would mean an increase in fires and even more forest loss.. The Amazon stores as much as 733 Gt of carbon dioxide, and releasing much of it into the atmosphere would likely contribute to pushing global temperature increase above the 1.5C safety threshold, the report explained.  'Urgent action is needed to avoid global repercussions and to ensure that this region can continue to regulate the planet's climate and to provide environmental and cultural benefits to the world,' said Roberto Troya, Regional Director for WWF Latin America and the Caribbean.  Drastic times, drastic measures  According to the WWF report, it's not too late to stop deforestation from pushing the Amazon past its tipping point. But it's going to take massive collaboration from governments, civil society, the private sector and Indigenous communities, among other important stakeholders to make it happen.  The report advocated for the COICA-led 'Amazon for Life' initiative to conserve at least 80% of Amazon forests by 2025.  Aerial view of Amazon rainforest landscape scarred by open pit gold mines. Image by Rhett A. Butler.  The forestry and agricultural industry, banks and governments must work together, the report said, to monitor whether supply chains are contributing to deforestation. Beef, soy and other agricultural products have been found to clear primary forest without punishment because traceability systems aren't always rigorous enough.  'Some companies are working harder than others to follow their own money,' said Kelly McNamara, a senior research and policy analyst in the International Climate and Agriculture Finance Program.  Existing protected areas, many of which are under threat of being downgraded to allow for infrastructure development, will require complex management plans that involve better monitoring and reporting by local communities and officials.  A strong sustainable forest management, in which forestry products are harvested without contributing to forest degradation, will also ensure the long-term health of forests while helping to combat illegal logging, the WWF report said.  The report stressed that Indigenous peoples are key to carrying out virtually all of these initiatives, as their livelihoods are often connected to their territories' ecosystems. Fishing, ancestral agricultural systems, tourism and other cultural practices, it said, make Indigenous people critical players in protecting the Amazon in the future.  'Indigenous communities have been stewards of the land for hundreds of years, thousands of years,' McNamara said about the importance the report places on Indigenous communities. 'They certainly have a critical role to play in preserving the native vegetation and keeping the biodiversity across the Amazon and cerrado in check.'

2022-12-13,"Deforestation Of Amazon Rainforest Increased Even After Lula Election, COP27 Climate Talks",496,"Dec 13, 2022( Latin Times: http://www.latintimes.com Delivered by Newstex)   Despite the election of Luiz Incio Lula da Silva, who has made his pro-environmental policies clear during the U.N. climate talks in Egypt last month, the deforestation of the Amazon rainforest is reported to have increased sharply during the month of November.  Surveillance from Brazil's national space institute showed that over 214 square miles were cleared during the month of November, said to be 60% above the month's average deforestation and more than double the amount that occurred the November of last year, according to Mongbay[1].  Most concerning during this time period are aerial photographs of what environmentalists are calling the 'Road to Chaos,' a 75-mile road carved in the middle of an indigenous territory in Brazil's Amazon that's reportedly focused on smuggling excavators to the protected lands of the Yanomami, The Guardian[2] reported.  The size of the destruction was described by Greenpeace environmentalist Danicley de Aguiar as the group shows the havoc to journalists, which include four excavators working on digging through the Yanomami's lands for gold.  Indigenous leader Sônia Guajajara claimedthat these politically-connected mining gangs had used everyone's focus on the recent Presidential elections to smuggle the excavators in, which was seen destroying nearby territory during the reconnaissance mission of the environmentalists.  The wildcat prospectors of gold, called the garimpeiros, were initially encouraged to mine on the lands of the Yanomami before international pressure forced the government to convert it to protected lands. But as lax enforcement and soaring gold prices continued during the past decade, many were enticed to return to the protected lands to dig for gold.  'It's astonishing. You're in the lap of this great forest and it's almost as if you're in one those old films about ancient EgyptAll those monstrous machines destroying the earth to make money,' photographer Joo Laet said.  The overall deforestation happening in the Amazon appeared to have increased this year to 10,049 square kilometers in the past 11months, considered the largest amount of loss in the Amazon since at least 2008.  Many are hoping to reverse course on the Amazon's destruction now that Lula da Silva has been elected president. His first two terms in office presided over a significant decline in the destruction of the rainforest,and he has made promises during the campaign and during the COP27 climate talks in Egypt to lessen the deforestation and help take care of the Amazon.

2022-11-30,"Deforestation of the Amazon increased 59% under Bolsonaro, says Inpe",497,"In one year, the Brazilian Amazon registered 11,568 km² of deforestation, a rate that puts measurements during the government of Jair Bolsonaro (PL) with a negative record: a 59.5% increase in the deforestation rate in the Amazon compared to the previous four years. The data are from Prodes, which is part of Inpe (National Institute for Space Research), and are part of a monitoring of 108 satellite images of clear cut deforestation in the Legal Amazon between August 1, 2021 and July 31, 2022. In relation to the values for the same period in the 2020-2021 biennium, there was a reduction of 11.27%. Even so, the index is the highest, excluding the previous year, since 2008. Among the states of the Legal Amazon, Pará was the state most responsible for the negative result - 4,141 km² were deforested in 2022, 21% less than in the previous year. However, the highlight was the state of Amazonas, the only one to register an increase in destruction: the satellites captured 2,607 km² of deforestation, an increase of 13%. For the Climate Observatory, a group that brings together environmental organizations in Brazil, one of the justifications is the ""expected paving of the BR-319 highway (Manaus-Porto Velho), a highway that cuts through the largest block of intact Amazon forest"", in addition to the reduction of Ibama's effective work in the field. See deforestation rates by state for the 2021-2022 biennium: Acre: 847 km² Amazonas: 2,607 km² Amapá: 6 km² Maranhão: 282 km². Mato Grosso: 1,906 km². Pará: 4,141 km² Rondônia: 1,512 km² Roraima: 240 km² Tocantins: 27 km² Total deforestation in 2021-2022: 11,568 km². Inheritance of Bolsonaro. With the near end of the Bolsonaro government, the president's legacy regarding deforestation is historical, but by the negative sense. The president became the leader with the largest increase in deforestation recorded since 1988, when the historical series of Prodes begins. ""If he wants to see forest destruction numbers decrease by 2023, Lula will have to have zero tolerance for environmental crime from the first day of his administration. And that includes holding those who sabotaged environmental governance in the country while in government over the past four years accountable,"" said Márcio Astrini, executive secretary of the Climate Observatory."
2022-12-02,"Despite 11% drop in 2022, Amazon deforestation rate has soared under Bolsonaro",498,"Dec 02, 2022( Mongabay News: http://news.mongabay.com Delivered by Newstex)   An area equivalent to the size of Qatar was cleared in the Brazilian Amazon between Aug. 1, 2021, and July 31, 2022, according to data from the country's National Space Research Institute (INPE).Although the figure represents an 11.27% decrease in the Amazon annual deforestation rate compared with the prior year, the government of President Bolsonaro still accounts for the most Amazon destruction in the last 34 years, environmentalists say.Bolsonaro's four-year term ends with a 59.5% boom in Amazon deforestation rates, the highest in a presidential term since 1988, when measurements by satellite imagery began.INPE's report, dated Nov. 3 but only released 27 days later, also triggered criticism among environmentalists, who accused the Bolsonaro's administration of omitting the annual deforestation data until the end of the UN conference on climate change, COP27, held Nov. 6-20 in Egypt. Annual deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon dropped 11.27% compared with the prior year, official data show. But the government of President Bolsonaro still accounts for the most Amazon destruction in the last 34 years, environmentalists say.  Between Aug. 1, 2021, and July 31, 2022, an area of 11,568 square kilometers (4,466 square miles) — equivalent to the size of Qatar — was cleared, according to preliminary analysis of satellite imagery[1] released Nov. 30 by the country's National Space Research Institute (INPE). The deforestation for the prior period (Aug. 1, 2020, to July 31, 2021) was 13,038 km2 (5,034 mi2), the highest since 2006[2].  Since Bolsonaro took office in January 2019, he has dismantled environmental agencies and slashed budgets for operations to fight environmental crimes. He also has pushed an anti-environmental and anti-Indigenous agenda in Congress, dubbed the 'death package[3].'  As a result, his four-year term ends with a 59.5% boom in Amazon deforestation rates, the highest in a presidential term since 1988, when measurements by satellite imagery began, according to the Observatório do Clima, or the Climate Observatory, a network of Brazilian civil society organizations advocating for climate action.  'The Bolsonaro regime was a forest-burning machine. The outgoing President was sworn in with deforestation at 7,500 km2 and is stepping out with 11,500 km2. The only good news here is precisely that he is stepping out,' Marcio Astrini, executive secretary of the Climate Observatory said[4] in a news release.  The state of Amazonas was the only one that showed an increase in deforestation rates (2,607 km2 or 13.05%), INPE data show, while Amap state accounted for the highest percentage of deforestation rate reduction (6 km2 or 64.71%). On the other hand, although Par recorded a 20.94% decrease in its deforestation rate, the state remains the largest absolute contributor to Amazon deforestation with 4,141 km2 (1,599 mi2) alone in 2022, INPE noted.  INPE's report, dated Nov. 3 but only released 27 days later, also triggered criticism among environmentalists. 'As in 2021, Jair Bolsonaro's administration continued opting to omit the annual deforestation data until the end of the UN conference on climate change, COP27, held between November 6 and 20, in Egypt,' Greenpeace said in a news release. 'The attitude is one more of the actions of the federal government that seek to camouflage its vexatious legacy of much destruction.'  NGOs urge recently elected President Lula to take immediate measures to tackle deforestation in the Amazon. 'If Lula wants to see the numbers of forest destruction decrease in 2023, he will have to have zero tolerance with environmental crime since day one in office. And that includes bringing to justice those who sabotaged environmental governance in the country while occupying the government in the last four years,' said Astrini.

2022-10-31,"During Bolsonaro's presidency, 73% of deforestation in the Amazon occurred.",499,"Alt On October 30, 2022, the second round of presidentialelections was held in Brazil, in order to choose between the current president JairBolsonaro or the former president LuizLula da Silva. These elections, in which Lula won, are also relevant for the rest of the world because, during Bolsonaro's presidential term, Greenpeace mentioned that Brazil had an environmental dismantling. According to Greenpeace Brazil's article The truth about the Amazon under Bolsonaro's government: ""Bolsonaro's administration has made a daily effort to destroy the natural heritage of Brazilians"". For the average deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon in the first three years of his government (2019-2021) compared to the previous three years (2016 -2018), increased 52.9 percent. Amazonia is the largest tropical rainforest in the world, according to the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) this region is home to 10% of known biodiversity. In addition, its rivers represent between 15 and 16% of the total riverdischarge to the world's oceans. WWF declares the Amazon Biome as ""virtually unparalleled"", considering that the Amazon River flows for more than 6,600 km. The river is home to about 85% of the fish species in South America. Moreover, the Amazon contains between 90 and 140 billion metric tons of carbon, according to WWF. While the Brazilian Forestry Institute stated that 30 million animal species live in the Amazon, including more than a thousand types of birds. However, the largest rainforest in the world was affected during 2019 and 2021 by the deforestation of 13,235 km² in the biome. In the article published by Greenpeace, on October 28, 2022 manifests some actions, which increased the lack of care for the environment. The first is the favoring of the Ministry of the Environment, headed by RicardoSalles, towards the logging, mining and civil construction sectors. The above with the creation of norms that did not need to pass through Congress, which made them unlawful, according to the civil organization. Among these norms are: Allowing the sale of timber without proof of origin. Construction on mangroves and sandbanks Amnesty for deforesters  Ricardo Salles on June 23, 2021, left as a legacy ""two years of high deforestation, two successive records of fires in the Amazon"". As well as ""26% of the Pantanal burned and the international image of the country in mud"", declares Greenpeace Brazil. Despite the fact that, during his campaign, Bolsonaro promisednot todemarcate ""one centimeter"" of indigenous land, Greenpeace exposes the alliances of the Brazilian president with the ruralists in Congress and the attempt to do away with indigenous lands. By 2020 he sent to Congress Bill 191/2020, which opened up indigenous lands for mineral and energy exploration. And with what is mentioned in the article, with data from MapBiomas, between 2019 and 2020 in these territories were opened the largest miningareas since the 1980s, multiplying tenfold in the period the destruction of forests for illegalmining. Bolsonaro's government ""censored the investigations of officials in the environmental area and discredited the scientists responsible for the deforestation data"", indicates the civil association. It also speaks of the 2021 budget allocated to the environment as the lowest in the last 21 years . In addition, it handed over to the ArmedForces the actions against deforestation, resulting in 73% of damage in the Amazon. Norway and Germanysuspended donations to the Amazon Fund, following the Brazilian president's proposal to use this money as compensation to occupants of public lands. Meanwhile, the Minister of Economy, PauloGuedes, defended at the World Economic Forum a backward, toxic and exclusionary model of agriculture, according to Greenpeace. Moreover, Brazil opposed a global agreement for the protection of biodiversity in the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity. Bolsonaro's campaign plans regarding the environmental issue did not change, as he proposed to continue with the allocation of budget to the Armed Forces to safeguard the environment. This action brought him criticism from environmentalists, who complained about the lack of positive results in his current governorship. Luiz Inácio Lula Da Silva, during his campaign, declared to fight illegalmining, fires and deforestation in the Amazon rainforest. In addition to strengthening the preservation and control organs, weakened during Bolsonaro's administration. During his administration, he intends to recover the resources of the Amazon Fund and reduce the greenhouse gas emissions assumed in the Paris Agreement."
2022-11-18,Ending Amazon deforestation: 4 essential reads about the future of the world's largest rainforest,500,"Brazil's president-elect, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, was greeted with applause and cheers when he addressed the U.N. climate conference in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, on Nov. 16, 2022. As he had in his campaign, Lula pledged to stop rampant deforestation in the Amazon, which his predecessor, Jair Bolsanaro, had encouraged.  Forests play a critical role in slowing climate change by taking up carbon dioxide, and the Amazon rainforest absorbs one-fourth of the CO2 absorbed by all the land on Earth. These articles from The Conversation's archive examine stresses on the Amazon and the Indigenous groups who live there. 1. Massive losses The Amazon rainforest is vast, covering some 2.3 million square miles (6 million square kilometers). It extends over eight countries, with about 60% of it in Brazil. And the destruction occurring there is also enormous.  From 2010 to 2019, the Amazon lost 24,000 square miles (62,000 square kilometers) of forest - the equivalent of about 10.3 million U.S. football fields. Much of this land was turned into cattle ranches, farms and palm oil plantations. ""There are a number of reasons why this deforestation matters - financial, environmental and social,"" wrote Washington University in St. Louis data scientist Liberty Vittert, explaining why she and other judges chose Amazon deforestation as the Royal Statistical Society's International Statistic of the Decade.  Forest clearance in the region threatens people, wild species and freshwater supplies along with the climate. ""The farmers, commercial interest groups and others looking for cheap land all have a clear vested interest in deforestation going ahead, but any possible short-term gain is clearly outweighed by long-term loss,"" Vittert concluded. À lire aussi : Statistic of the decade: The massive deforestation of the Amazon 2. Legalizing land grabs Much of the Amazon has been under state control for decades. In the 1970s, Brazil's military government started encouraging farmers and miners to move into the region to spur economic development, while also setting some zones aside for conservation. More recently, however, Brazil's government has made it easier for wealthy interests to seize large swaths of land - including in conservation areas and Indigenous territories. Reviewing national laws and land holdings, University of Florida geographers Gabriel Cardoso Carrero, Cynthia S. Simmons and Robert T. Walker found that Brazil's National Congress was expanding the legal size of private holdings in the Amazon even before Bolsonaro was elected in 2019.  In southern Amazonas state, Amazonia's most active deforestation frontier, rates of deforestation started to rise in 2012 because of loosened regulatory oversight. The number and size of clearings that the researchers identified using satellite data increased after Bolsonaro took office. ""Because of policy interventions and the greening of agricultural supply chains, deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon fell after 2005, reaching a low point in 2012, when it began trending up again because of weakening environmental governance and reduced surveillance,"" they observed. ""In our view, the global community can help by insisting that supply chains for Amazonian beef and soybean products originate on lands deforested long ago and whose legality is long-standing.""

Indigenous resistance Road building in the Amazon, which increased dramatically during Bolsonaro's tenure, brings development and related threats like wildfires into wild areas. University of Richmond geographer David Salisbury also saw it as an existential threat to Indigenous communities.  Indigenous residents of the Brazilian-Peruvian borderlands where Salisbury worked ""understand that the loggers and their tractors and chainsaws are the sharp point of a road allowing coca growers, land traffickers and others access to traditional Indigenous territories and resources,"" Salisbury reported. ""They also realize that their Indigenous communities may be all that stands in defense of the forest and stops invaders and road builders."" Several Indigenous women won office as federal deputies in Brazil's recent elections, and Lula has pledged to protect Indigenous people's rights. Salisbury saw it as crucial to ensure that Indigenous defenders of the Amazon receive ""the support and educational opportunities needed to be safe, prosperous and empowered to protect their rainforest home.""

Five global deforestation drivers: Beef, soy, palm oil, wood - and crime A small handful of highly lucrative commodities are the main causes of deforestation in the Amazon and other tropical regions around the world. In Brazil, much of the land is cleared for raising beef cattle or cultivating soy. In Indonesia and Malaysia, palm oil production is spurring large-scale rainforest destruction. Wood production, for pulp and paper products as well as fuel, is also a major driver in Asia and Africa. ""Making the supply chains for these four commodities more sustainable is an important strategy for reducing deforestation,"" wrote Texas State University geographer Jennifer Devine. But Devine also found a fifth factor interwoven with these four industries: organized crime. ""Large, lucrative industries offer opportunities to move and launder money; as a result, in many parts of the world, deforestation is driven by the drug trade,"" she reported. In the Amazon, for example, drug traffickers are illegally logging forests and hiding cocaine in timber shipments to Europe.  ""Promoting sustainable production and consumption are critical to halting deforestation worldwide. But in my view, national and industry leaders also have to root organized crime and illicit markets out of these commodity chains,"" Devine concluded.

2022-11-30,ENVIRONMENT - French banks accused of 'massively' fuelling Amazon deforestation,501,"French banks are ""massively"" financing deforestation in the Amazon rainforest and tropical Cerrado savanna – providing hundreds of millions of euros to Brazilian agribusiness giants responsible for driving forest loss over the past decade, a coalition of NGOs and media outlets has warned. BNP Paribas, Société Générale, Crédit Agricole and the Banque Populaire et Caisse d'Epargne group are accused of contributing to the razing of 9,500 square metres of vegetation cleared to create land for soy, palm oil and beef farming. A report published Monday by investigative news sites Disclose and Reporter Brasil – in partnership with the NGOs Sherpa, Harvest and the Centre for Climate Crime Analysis – found the banks had invested more than 743 million euros in ventures linked to deforestation between 2013 and 2022. BNP Paribas singled out At the top of that list was BNP Paribas, singled out as the largest French financial supporter of the sector – and the country's ""leading bank for deforestation"". ""Between January 2021 and September 2022 alone, BNP Paribas invested nearly 117 million euros in the activities of several agribusiness giants directly involved in the deforestation of the Amazon and the Cerrado,"" the report said. ""This financing is carried out despite promises and commitments made in favour of the environment."" In February 2021, BNP pledged to stop investing in firms contributing to clearing tropical forest for beef or soybean production in the Amazon and Cerrado, and to only fund companies with zero deforestation strategies by 2025. The report alleges this promise was not met. French supermarket giant Casino sued over links to Amazon deforestation As part of its investigation, the coalition analysed thousands of financial transactions – corporate loans, bonds, equity investments and share issues – tracked by the Forest and Finance platform, which assesses the finance received by hundreds of companies involved in the beef, soy, palm oil, pulp, paper, rubber and timber supply chains. Agribusiness giants named in the report include Bunge and Cargill, both American, and Brazilian companies Minerva, Marfrig and JBS. The latter, the world's top beef producer, is accused of illegally shipping meat from farms that have been banned by both Brazil and the European Union. Duty of vigilance law Since February 2017, a corporate ""duty of vigilance"" law opens French businesses up to potential legal action for human rights violations and environmental damage linked to their supply chains. ""BNP Paribas is the first bank to invest in the Amazon,"" said Jean-Philippe Foegle, a lawyer and advocacy officer at Sherpa, adding French companies were bound by law to monitor their foreign activities. Cop27 climate summit charts small path for global food justice ""What the duty of vigilance and anti-money laundering legislation provides for is that when you have a suspicion that the actor you are financing is involved in illegal activities, you must ensure that you do not finance that actor,"" he said. In response, BNP Paribas told RFI it had made strict commitments to protect the environment and it would take time for those practices to be implemented on the ground. Sherpa says it is considering legal action to force banks to follow through on their commitments. Radio France Internationale - All rights of reproduction and distribution reserved. "
2023-01-07,Every year 10 million hectares of forest are destroyed worldwide,502," In 2022, some 786,000 hectares of forest were burned in the EU and 28 million tons of CO? were released into the atmosphere. Photo: (EPA) EFE - Raphael AlvesEvery year some 10 million hectares of forests are destroyed, an area larger than the size of Portugal and equivalent to that of Iceland, according to the UN, which points to this ""alarming"" global deforestation, along with agriculture and other land use changes, as responsible for 25% of global greenhouse gas emissions. (See: Infographic: How has biodiversity changed over time?) According to the latest report from the UN-REDD Programme, the United Nations Environment Programme World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC) and the Green Gigaton Challenge (GGC) initiative, the world is not on track to achieve the forest goals of ending and reversing deforestation by 2030, a key aspiration for progress towards the Paris Agreement target of 1.5° Celsius . The report concludes that, for the 2030 targets to be achievable, the milestone of one gigatonne equivalent in emissions reversed by forests must be reached by 2025 at the latest. Deforestation of the AmazonPrecisely climate defense in general and reversing the deforestation of the Amazon in particular was one of the banners of the campaign that brought to power the new president of Brazil, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who plans to convene a summit this year with the presidents of the eleven countries that share the planet's largest plant lung . His commitment is to reestablish measures to combat deforestation in the Amazon abandoned by his predecessor in office, Jair Bolsonaro, during whose mandate forest destruction increased by almost 60%, with an average area devastated of 11,396 square kilometers per year. (Read: Marina Silva, defender of the Brazilian Amazon who repeats as Minister of the Environment) Forest firesForest fires are among the causes of deforestation, which, in addition to destroying forests and biodiversity, release large quantities of CO? into the atmosphere . By way of example, in 2022 some 786,000 hectares of forest were burned in the EU, 39% of them in Spain, and 28 million tons of CO? were released into the atmosphere. Figures similar to those in other parts of the world in a particularly virulent year: the outbreaks of fires at the beginning of 2022 in the northeastern Argentine province of Corrientes devastated 785,000 hectares, and in Bolivia 854,724 hectares burned up to September alone. Global greenhouse gas emissionsWith this scenario, the UN believes that limiting the average global temperature increase to 1.5°C will be impossible without forests playing a major role, both in terms of the massive emissions reductions that can be achieved by halting deforestation and the additional carbon that can be sequestered through improved forest management and reforestation . Their calculations indicate that eliminating emissions from deforestation and increasing carbon removals by promoting forest regeneration and landscape restoration could reduce global net emissions by up to 30% and, over the next decade, forests could provide up to 50% of the cost-effective mitigation available. That target is a long way off, however, considering that between about 10 million hectares of forests are destroyed each year, deforestation that is responsible for about 25% of global greenhouse gas emissions, along with agriculture and other land-use changes. ""Deforestation and land degradation also undermine efforts to build resilience to climate impacts and threaten forest-dwelling communities,"" the UN laments. (You may be interested in: They went in search of an extinct parakeet in Colombia and discovered the first eagle's nest) About 70% of tropical forest destruction is generated by the production of agricultural commodities, including palm oil, beef, soy, timber, and pulp and paper, says the UN, whose opinion is that halting this trend requires decoupling the production of raw materials from deforestation .???? ????

2023-01-17,Former director of Inpe is the new president of CNPq,503,"The scientist Ricardo Galvão will be the new president of the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq). The appointment was made this Tuesday (17) by the Minister of Science, Technology and Innovation, Luciana Santos, in a ceremony in Brasília (DF). The researcher will be responsible for coordinating the area of funding research grants for undergraduate and graduate students. Galvão was director of the National Institute for Space Research (Inpe) from 2016 to 2019. The scientist was exonerated by former president Jair Bolsonaro (PL) after releasing data on deforestation in the Amazon. At the time, Bolsonaro's government criticized information from the institute that showed increased deforestation in July 2019. Bolsonaro and members of the government claimed that the data was wrong and its release damaged Brazil's image and affected trade agreements. Ricardo Galvão is a full professor at the Institute of Physics at the University of São Paulo (USP). He was designated as one of the ten most important people for science by Nature Magazine in 2019. In 2021, Galvão received the Scientific Freedom and Responsibility Award from the American Association for the Advancement of Science.

2023-02-27,French bank BNP Paribas accused of financing deforestation in Brazil,504,"Several NGOs have filed a lawsuit against French bank BNP Paribas, denouncing it for financing Marfrig, a Brazilian agribusiness giant, accused of contributing to deforestation, land grabbing and forced labor - the plaintiffs announced on Monday (27). Filed by Brazilian NGO Comissão Pastoral da Terra (CPT) and French association Notre Affaire À Tous in a Paris court, the complaint was unveiled four days after BNP Paribas was sued by three other environmental defense associations for its ""significant contribution"" to global warming by its oil and gas clients. It follows a formal notice issued in late October by CPT and Notre Affaire à Tous, requesting that BNP Paribas end its financial support for Marfrig, Brazil's second largest meatpacker. According to both organizations, the company ""would have been responsible for more than 120,000 hectares of illegal deforestation in the Amazon forest and the Cerrado savannah"" between 2009 and 2020. The associations accuse BNP Paribas of having violated the French law on duty of vigilance. The law requires multinationals headquartered in France to establish a plan, ""including reasonable surveillance measures to identify risks and prevent serious violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms, people's health and safety, and the environment, resulting from the activities of the company and the companies it controls"" in France and abroad. ""Despite its commitments and its communications (...), the accumulating evidence of BNP's support for Marfrig and Marfrig's lack of vigilance towards its suppliers reveal the inadequacy of the measures taken by BNP. We cannot close our eyes to deforestation and forced labor and pretend to be an actor of change and carbon neutrality,"" argued Jérémie Suissa, the general delegate of Notre Affaire à Tous, in a statement released on Monday. Contacted by AFP, the BNP said it ""regrets"" that the NGOs seek ""the path of litigation rather than dialogue. The bank also said it demands that ""by 2025 its clients have a 'zero deforestation' strategy in their production and supply chains, as well as full traceability of supply chains (direct and indirect) in beef and soy from the Brazilian Amazon and Cerrado,"" adding that it ""will no longer provide products, or financial services, to companies that are not aligned with this policy.""

2022-11-29,French banks accused of financing deforestation of the Amazon and Cerrado,505,"A partnership between two media platforms and three NGOs released a report on Monday (28) accusing several French banks of financing agribusiness giants operating in Brazil, disregarding their environmental commitments and financing the deforestation of the Amazon and Cerrado. The destruction of the Amazon forest broke all records in 2022, with about 9,500 km² of forest devastated. In the Cerrado, the destruction registered an increase of more than 28% in the first seven months of this year, according to data released in August by the National Institute for Space Research (Inpe), compared with the same period in 2021. In most cases, the devastation of these two of the largest Brazilian biomes occurs due to intensive agriculture, destined to the cultivation of soy, palm oil, and cattle breeding. An investigation carried out by the information platforms Disclose and Repórter Brasil, in partnership with the NGOs Sherpa, Harvest, and Center Climate Crime Analysis, pointed out that this environmental catastrophe has been supported by four French banks for almost ten years: BNP Paribas, the Banque Populaire et Caisse d'Épargne group (BPCPE), Société Générale, and Crédit Agricole. The report found that these four institutions financed companies linked to the deforestation of the Amazon and Cerrado with more than 743 million euros (almost R$4.2 billion) between 2013 and 2022. In total, the report highlights more than 12,000 financial transactions, compiled by NGO Forest & Finance, between these four French banks and agribusiness giants. The document cites the Americans Bunge and Cargill, as well as the Brazilians Minerva, Marfrig, and JBS, the world's top beef producer. BNP Paribas, the main bank involved According to Disclose, the main bank involved in the transactions is BNP Paribas, France's largest, which is said to have disbursed more than 456 million euros (more than R$2.5 billion) in investments in soy, beef and palm oil in about ten years. ""Between January 2021 and September 2022 alone, BNP invested some 117 million euros in the activities of several agribusiness giants involved in the deforestation of the Amazon and Cerrado,"" says the platform's website. On its website, Repórter Brasil says that in 2021, BNP Paribas had already committed to no longer finance companies involved in the destruction of Brazilian forests by adopting new criteria. ""However, data from the Forests & Finance coalition show the opposite: this was precisely the year of BNP Paribas' highest financing to the company Marfrig, one of the three large Brazilian meatpacking plants,"" the platform says. Jean-Philippe Foegle, lawyer at Sherpa, one of the NGOs partnered by Disclose and Repórter Brasil in the investigative report, says that the financing by French banks does not have the precise objective of destroying Brazilian forests, ""but they make investments in companies that are known to practice deforestation. Foegle recalls that French law obliges institutions to be prudent in their activities abroad. ""What the duty of vigilance and anti-money laundering legislation provides for is that when you have a suspicion that the actor you finance is involved in illegal activities, you must stop financing him,"" he explains. Policy ""in transition"" Contacted by RFI, BNP Paribas assures that it has put in place a strict policy to stop supporting companies involved in the deforestation of Brazilian biomes. This project, for which the bank claims it needs more time to implement, would be in transition. However, for Sherpa's lawyer, this justification is not enough. ""French banks have been committed to these engagements for years. If we wait for companies that operate in the Amazon and Cerrado to regularize their activities, it is absolutely possible that the banks that finance them, such as BNP Paribas, will suspend their investments in them. According to Foegle, Sherpa plans to take legal action in France to force the French banks cited in the report to comply with their commitments."
2023-02-08,"French Foreign Minister to meet with Lula to ""relaunch"" the relationship, with the Amazon on the agenda",506,"French Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna will begin a two-day visit to Brazil on Wednesday with the aim of ""relaunching"" a political relationship degraded during the mandate of Jair Bolsonaro, with the Amazon on the agenda, a diplomatic source said. ""The main objective is to relaunch our relationship at the political level. These last four years were not at the height of the relations we should have,"" the consulted source told the press. Colonna will meet this Wednesday in Brasilia with Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, with Foreign Minister Mauro Vieira and with Environment Minister Marina Silva, among other meetings on the Amazon and democracy, said the same source. On Thursday, the head of French diplomacy will travel to Sao Paulo - Brazil's economic capital - to meet with the governor, Tarcísio de Freitas, with French companies present in Brazil and with the expatriate community, and to visit a center to help battered women. Paris seeks to launch a roadmap to ""update"" the strategic partnership signed in 2008 between Lula and the then French president, Jacques Chirac, to reinforce ""now central"" themes such as environmental ""challenges"", global governance, etc. Cross-border cooperation - France has with Brazil its largest land border with French Guiana - will also be on the agenda. The goal is for the Brazilian president, who began his third term in office in January, and his French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron, to seal this update during a meeting between the two later this year, although no date has yet been set, the diplomatic source said. The meeting could take place around the Amazon summit - planned for 2023 but without date - promoted by Lula and his Colombian counterpart, Gustavo Petro, and to which Macron was invited, the French Foreign Ministry said. Lula's return to power in the Latin American giant, which he had already governed between 2003 and 2010, was a balm for the relations between both economic powers, degraded during the mandate of the far-right Bolsonaro. Symbolic of that bad relationship occurred during the last visit of a French foreign minister to Brazil, Jean-Yves Le Drian, in 2019. Bolsonaro canceled a meeting with him citing other obligations. At the time of the appointment, he appeared live on social networks cutting his hair. The resumption of the Franco-Brazilian relationship focuses, above all, on issues of tension with the previous administration: management of the Amazon, protection of democracy, defense of human rights and global governance. During a telephone conversation last January 26, Macron expressed to Lula his support after ""the attacks on Brazilian democracy"" in early January, when radical Bolsonaro supporters ransacked the headquarters of the public authorities in Brasilia. Interest in the Amazon During Jair Bolsonaro's government, the Brazilian Amazon reached a deforestation record. During his last year alone in the Planalto Palace, 10,267 kilometers of vegetation cover were lost, equivalent to a country like Lebanon. This figure, in turn, shows an increase of 24.9% over the area of forest damaged the previous year, when it was 8,219 square kilometers. Thus, 2022 recorded the highest number since the National Institute of Special Studies (INPE) began measuring so-called deforestation alerts in 2015. Prior to the latest report released, the year with the highest deforestation recorded was 2019, when Bolsonaro became president of Brazil, and 9,178 square kilometers were lost. For these estimates, the agency uses satellite images disseminated by Deter, a mechanism that alerts monthly and in real time about threatened areas in the Amazon. However, its data are less precise than those of Prodes, another tool used by INPE to calculate deforestation each year. Prodes released its latest bulletin in November and reported that, between August 2021 and July 2022, the Amazon lost 11,568 kilometers of vegetation, an extension 11.3% less than that recorded in the same period of the previous year, when it was 13,038 square kilometers. This was, however, the highest in the last 14 years. The report also informed that between August and December 2022 alone, 4,793 kilometers of forest were logged there, a record for the period. In addition, in December alone, deforestation extended over 218.4 square kilometers, which represents a 150% jump compared to the same month in 2021, when it was only 87 square kilometers. Again the highest number for this month since the beginning of the previous government. These figures are not surprising since, from the very beginning, Bolsonaro stated that forest conservation was not one of his priorities. On the contrary, he decimated the offices in charge of its preservation and defended mining even in the reserves. This caused multiple criticisms from environmental groups, who hold him responsible for the current crisis in the Amazon. In view of this delicate context and in order to fulfill one of his main campaign promises, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva assured that one of the priorities of his administration will be to reduce deforestation in the Amazon to a minimum. To this he added a relentless fight against illegal logging and mining, also major causes of environmental disasters. In this sense, his Minister of the Environment, the environmentalist Marina Silva, moved forward with the creation of a secretariat dedicated exclusively to combating deforestation.

2023-01-30,Germany announces fund for environmental policies in Brazil,507,"SAO PAULO (AP) - German Development Minister Svenja Schulze announced Monday that her government will make 204 million euros ($222 million) available for environmental policies in Brazil. Of this total, US$ 38 million is a donation to the Amazon Fund, Schulze told journalists in the capital, Brasilia. This is the most important international cooperation effort to preserve the Amazon rainforest and is financed mainly by Norway. In 2019, former far-right president Jair Bolsonaro, who considered the Amazon a national issue, dissolved the steering committee that selects sustainable projects to fund. In reaction, Germany and Norway froze their donations. ""With the new government and the team of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and (Environment) Minister Marina Silva, we have a great opportunity to protect the forest and offer a new perspective to the people who live there,"" Schulze said. Under Bolsonaro, deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon reached a 15-year high with the disappearance of environmental protection policies in favor of agribusiness expansion. Germany also pledged to provide $87 million in low-interest loans for farmers to restore degraded areas and $34 million for Amazonian state authorities to protect the rainforest. ""Despite all the difficulties, the increase in deforestation, land grabbing, fires, the precarious situation of indigenous peoples, we see this as an opportunity to reverse this whole situation,"" Silva said during the press conference. Lula, who took office in January, pledged to end all deforestation by 2030. His four-year term ends in December 2026. The Amazon, which covers an area twice the size of India, acts as a buffer against climate change because its trees absorb large amounts of carbon dioxide and about two-thirds of the Amazon rainforest is in Brazil.

2023-01-02,Germany to resume investments in the Amazon Fund,509,"Traveling to Brazil, the president of Germany, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, visited the state of Amazonas today (2). In Manaus, he met with governor Wilson Lima, reappointed yesterday (1), with whom he talked about the Amazon. Steinmeier came to Brazil to honor the new president of the Republic, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, in his inauguration, yesterday (1°). During the meeting with Wilson Lima, the German representative spoke about his country's intentions to resume investments in the region through the Amazon Fund. Related news: Supreme Court determines reactivation of the Amazon Fund. Norway and Germany donated R$ 3.4 billion to the Amazon Fund. The Amazon Fund aims to finance projects to reduce deforestation and control the biome. The financing mechanism had been deactivated by the last government and has been reactivated now, after determination of the Supreme Court (STF). According to the German president, the investments planned are around 35 million euros. Created in 2008, the fund receives donations from international institutions and governments to finance actions to prevent and combat deforestation in the Legal Amazon. In 2019, Germany and Norway suspended transfers to new projects after the Brazilian government suggested changes in the application of resources and abolished the fund's management collegiate. Visit to Manaus Steinmeier went to the state of Amazonas to learn about projects and actions financed with funds from the German government. Among them is the Atto Tower, in São Sebastião do Uatumã, about 240 kilometers from Manaus. This tower monitors the climatic conditions of the region and the greenhouse effect issues, coordinated by Brazilian and German researchers.

2022-11-04,Growing soy on cattle pasture can eliminate Amazon deforestation in Brazil,510,"Nov 04, 2022( Mongabay News: http://news.mongabay.com Delivered by Newstex)   Expanding soy cultivation into underutilized cattle pastureland would help prevent massive deforestation and carbon emissions compared to the current practice of clearing new forest for farmland, a new study says.Experts say that Brazil, the world's No. 1 soy producer and beef exporter, has enough pastureland lying unused that would allow soy production to increase by more than a third without any further deforestation.Researchers warn that if Brazil continues with its current method of soy cultivation, it would end up clearing 5.7 million hectares (14 million acres) of Amazon rainforest and Cerrado savanna into cropland over the next 15 years.Environmentalists have welcomed intensifying agriculture as a solution to deforestation, but have raised concerns about the potential for increased pesticide use, biodiversity loss, and the expansion of cattle ranching into forested areas. Soy cultivation and cattle ranching are two of the biggest drivers of deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon. But instead of clearing more forest area for farmland, what if soy was grown on unused pastureland?  That's what a recently published study[1] sought to model. It found that deforestation could be eliminated and carbon emissions slashed if Brazil intensified its agricultural sector this way — a win-win for both the economy and the rainforest.  The study, published in Nature Sustainability, found that intensifying crop and livestock systems would stop soybean production expanding into forested areas, allowing Brazil to produce 162 million tons of soybeans over the next 15 years, boosting soy production in the Amazon and Cerrado biomes by 35% without any further deforestation.  'We have areas with a low number of cattle per hectare. If we improve agricultural practices and work with better management practices, we will be able to increase the capacity in the same area,' study co-author Alencar Zanon, an adjunct professor of biology at the Federal University of Santa Maria, told Mongabay by phone.  The Amazon rainforest and Cerrado grasslands, the key areas for soybean production in Brazil, the world's No. 1 producer of the grain, have swaths of little-used pasturelands that are prime for intensification.  'Cattle ranching in the Amazon is done inefficiently and extensively,' Sonaira Souza da Silva, an agronomist and professor at the Federal University of Acre, who was not involved in the study, told Mongabay by email. 'The stocking rate is less than one head of cattle per hectare, but with the application of effective and already known technical practices, it could rise to 2.5 or higher.'  Illegal deforestation and cattle ranching in the Amazon forest, which sometimes occurs in protected Indigenous reserves, such as here in the state of Maranho. Image Victor Moriyama/Greenpeace.  Those technical practices include increasing soybean yields by improving degraded pastures, harvesting two crops in a calendar year, and raising cattle within smaller pastures to free up space for more soy planted area.  The study says that if these changes aren't made, it will lead to 'massive encroachment on the Amazon rainforest, biodiversity loss, and increased global warming.' Under the business-as-usual scenario, up to 5.7 million hectares (14 million acres) of Amazon and Cerrado land would be cleared for cropland over the next 15 years, leading to 1,955 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions.  'If we intensify our agriculture, we can certainly eliminate deforestation,' Zanon said. 'The only way we have to protect the Amazon rainforest and to reduce global warming is through the intensification of agriculture.'  Most cattle ranchers in Brazil have small herds that graze on vast areas of pasture — the ideal starting point for expanding intensive farming in the country, Zanon said.  'We have enough open land in Brazil that, with sustainable intensification of livestock, we can recover degraded pasture area and so reduce legal deforestation,' Luiza Bruscato, executive manager of the nonprofit Sustainable Livestock Working Group (GTPS), who was not involved in the study, told Mongabay by phone.  Implementing such intensive agricultural techniques and eliminating deforestation could 'happen in just a few years,' Marcelo Stabile, a researcher at the Amazon Environmental Research Institute (IPAM) who was not involved in the study, told Mongabay by video call. 'We can prompt these changes through policies relating to credit, land tenure and environmental licensing, so that intensification can optimize the use of existing agricultural infrastructure.'

Image Fernando Frazo/Agncia Brasil. Soy farms driving deforestation  As the world's largest soy exporter[2], accounting for 40% of global exports[1] from 2017 to 2019, Brazil is economically reliant on the commodity. But soy production has historically happened at the expense of the environment, turning vast expanses of rainforest and savanna into farmland.  'Much of the increase in agricultural output has occurred from cropland expansion rather than cropland productivity,' the researchers say in the study.  From 2007 to 2019, the total area for soybean production in Brazil expanded[1] by 1.4 million hectares (3.5 million acres) per year — or 3,836 hectares (9,479 acres) per day, three times the size of London's Heathrow airport. Pastures and croplands have replaced nearly 65 million hectares (160.6 million acres) of forest and savanna in the Brazilian Amazon since 1985, a 2020 study found[3], with soy production in particular driving massive deforestation rates during the 1990s and early 2000s.  Under Brazil's Forest Code, farmers must set aside between 20 and 80% of native vegetation on their rural properties as 'legal reserves,' allowing a limited amount of legal deforestation for agricultural expansion. However, up to 90% of deforestation[4] is suspected to be illegal, carried out by ranchers, loggers, miners and land grabbers, who seek to profit from the occupation and exploitation of public lands.  'People don't deforest these lands to produce more beef or soy,' Stabile said. 'They do it because they can steal public lands and expect to claim the land titles and resell the land at a higher price.'  Other drivers of deforestation are infrastructure works (such as hydroelectric plants), road construction, mining projects, and forest fires, a 2018 study[5] found.  'Deforestation is complex and has a lot of aspects involved,' Miguel Scarcello, general secretary of the nonprofit conservation group SOS Amazonia, told Mongabay by phone. 'However, intensifying production is a good agricultural practice that, without a doubt, will help the Amazon a lot if it's adopted. I believe it will help reduce the pressure on forest areas.'  The border region between the states of Maranho, Tocantins, Piau and Bahia, known by the portmanteau Matopiba, is known for its high production of soy and corn, which have expanded rapidly in the last few decades at the expanse of the Cerrado and Amazon landscapes. Image Marizilda Cruppe/Greenpeace. Unintended drawbacks  Despite the positive impact that intensification could have on reducing deforestation, critics say it could lead to large monocultures, which bring their own set of environmental hazards.  'One of the big issues of monocultures is the huge use of chemical fertilizers and that their natural reserves are finite,' Silva said. 'This will generate instability in the production chain and in the exploitation of natural resources.'  Earlier this year[6], Brazil's lower house of Congress cited the shortage of fertilizers, caused by the Ukraine war, to push through a bill that would allow mining for potassium, a key element in fertilizers, on Indigenous territories — even though almost all of Brazil's potassium reserves lie outside Indigenous lands.  Soy production is also associated with pesticide use, raising concerns that an increase in cultivation would have further devastating effects on the environment.  'If farmers don't use the techniques correctly and it leads to an excessive use of pesticides, that could be a problem,' Scarcello said.  The long-term impact of pesticide use on soy crops, including the effects on human health and freshwater quality, are little understood, according to a 2020 paper[7]. It found that the herbicides and insecticides used in soy cultivation can be 'very toxic to aquatic ecosystems,' including pollinator populations.  As well as being detrimental to the environment, monocultures can also cause or exacerbate social conflicts.  A soy field stretches across the landscape in Mato Grosso, a state that's home to three of Brazil's most biodiverse biomes: the Amazon rainforest, the Cerrado grasslands, and the Pantanal wetlands. Image Marcelo Camargo/Agncia Brasil.  'Monocultures have a more mechanized workforce, which generates fewer jobs in some cases, and they are owned by the same owner who has a concentration of the income,' Bruscato said. 'I think these are things that need to be looked at and studied.'  Experts say that while using existing cattle pastures could eliminate the tree loss associated with soy cultivation, it could end up causing an increase in deforestation for more pasture. 'We need to monitor if the replacement of pasture with soy isn't simply pushing pastures into other areas and causing more deforestation for livestock,' Silva said.

2023-01-29,Human activity has degraded almost 40% of the Amazon in less than twenty years.,511," The Amazon rainforest is dying. Land conversion for agricultural and livestock land and climate change are 'killing' one of the 'lungs' of the planet, a critical point for global biodiversity.  A scientific study has revealed that human activity has degraded more than a third of the forests in the Amazon basin, an area five times the size of Spain. The authors have launched a dramatic call to prevent and contain illegal logging and the use of fire.  The research, carried out by an international team of 35 scientists and researchers from Brazil and the UK, has revealed that anthropogenic changes are occurring ""much faster"" than previously thought, and much more so than natural environmental changes in the past.  ""Degradation is having a major impact on biodiversity and carbon storage,"" warn the authors of the study, published in the journal 'Science'.  The report describes changes in the Amazon region between 2001 and 2018, and shows that much of the Amazon rainforest has been affected during that time period by some form of human disturbance, leading to ""carbon emissions equivalent to or greater than those from deforestation.""  The results of the study are troubling:""Approximately 2.5 million square kilometers of Amazon rainforest are currently degraded by fire, edge effects, timber extraction or extreme drought, representing 38% of all forests in the region,"" the authors warn.  Biodiversity loss  The researchers distinguish between deforestation and degradation. They define the former as ""the removal of the forest completely to establish a new land use, for example agriculture"", and the latter as the result of ""transient or long-term changes in forest conditions caused by humans"". Thus, although heavily degraded forests may lose almost all trees, the land use itself does not change, they explain.  Photo taken in 2019, four years after a fire affected this forest fragment, which was also previously affected by multiple anthropogenic disturbances, including selective logging, edge effects, and fires. Marizilda Cruppe / Rede Amazônia Sustentável  ""Most analyses of land-use change in the Amazon rainforest have focused on the causes and effects of deforestation. However, anthropogenic disturbances also cause degradation of the Amazon rainforest and threaten its future,"" they say.  Among these disturbances, the four most important are: edge effects (due to deforestation and consequent habitat fragmentation), timber extraction (in many cases illegal), fires (the vast majority caused by arson) and extreme droughts (intensified by human-induced climate change).  ""Despite uncertainty about the full effect of these disturbances, it is clear that their cumulative effect may be as important as deforestation through carbon emissions and biodiversity loss,"" highlights Jos Barlow, professor of conservation science at Lancaster University (UK) and co-author of the paper.  ""While some disturbances, such as edge effects, can be addressed by slowing deforestation, others, such as limiting the increase in extreme droughts, require additional measures, including global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,"" the researchers note.  Carbon emissions  ""Curbing degradation will also require engaging with the diverse set of actors that drive it,"" knowing in depth all the perturbations and ""providing a solid platform on which to build appropriate policies and programs to curb it,"" they add.  ""Carbon emissions from this degradation total up to 0.2 petagrams (200 million tons) per year, which is equivalent, if not greater, to the emissions from deforestation in the Amazon,"" they stress.  ""Degradation of the Amazon rainforest can reduce evapotranspiration during the dry season by up to 34% and cause as great a loss of biodiversity as deforestation in human-modified landscapes, generating unequal socioeconomic burdens, mainly for forest dwellers,"" they detail.  Figure summarizes the causes of degradation in the Amazon. Alex Argozino / Studio Argozino / Science Magazine  What is most worrying, according to the scientists, is that projections indicate that degradation will continue to be ""a dominant source of carbon emissions,"". In a projection made for 2050, the study reveals that the four factors already noted for degradation will continue to be the main sources of carbon emissions to the atmosphere, regardless of the growth or suppression of forest deforestation.  ""Even in an optimistic scenario, if there were no deforestation, the effects of climate change would cause forest degradation to continue, which would generate more carbon emissions,"" warns David Lapola, leader of the study.  ""Preventing the advance of deforestation remains vital, but efforts to slow deforestation must be integrated with policies to address degradation, and complemented by innovative measures to address the disturbances that degrade the Amazon rainforest,"" the scientists say.  They suggest delving into the concept of""smart forests"" which, like the idea of ""smart cities,"" would use different types of technologies and sensors to collect useful data to improve the quality of the environment. ""There is a need to invest in innovative strategies,"" Lapona concludes.  Reference study: https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abp8622  ......

The announcement of the international financial organization was made during the bilateral meeting of the Colombian President with the president of the IDB, Ilan Goldfajn, which took place this Wednesday in the framework of the World Economic Forum being held in Davos (Switzerland).According to official information, it was established that 70 million dollars from the IDB will be directed to the strengthening of the energy transition policy, one of the pillars of the Government of Change. The remaining 3.5 million dollars, donated by the multilateral bank, will be directed to the Amazon basin for the design and structuring of financial mechanisms and a regulatory framework to implement Payment for Environmental Services (PES) and mechanisms to reduce Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+).These are direct transfers for environmental conservation services that help contain and halt deforestation, in coordination with local communities and under the leadership of the Ministry of Environment.Additionally, the IDB president indicated that the IDB could support the financing of the logistics of the Amazon Summit and its technical tables.It should be noted that the IDB had approved a technical cooperation of US$450.The Presidency of the Republic also informed that the World Health Organization (WHO) will send a commission of experts to Colombia in the next few days to accompany the discussion of the health reform, announced this Wednesday the director of the international organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, in a meeting with President Gustavo Petro.At the meeting, held within the framework of the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos (Switzerland), President Petro asked to discuss the issue of patents and technology transfer in health matters.The WHO director, who was accompanied by the WHO director of Health and Multilateral Partnerships, Gaudenz Silberschmidt, invited the Colombian head of state to participate in the 76th World Health Assembly in Davos (Switzerland ) .

2023-01-18,"In 2022, the Amazon had the highest deforestation in 15 years",513,"Deforestation in the Amazon hit a new record in 2022, year in which the vegetation cover of the forest lost 10,573 km², equivalent to almost 3 thousand soccer fields, according to a report released today by the Institute of Man and Environment of the Amazon (Imazon). According to the satellite monitoring, 2022, which reached its highest level since 2008, when Imazon started monitoring the Amazon Region. In the last four years, forest loss in the Amazon was 35,193 km², according to Imazon. The area exceeds that of states like Sergipe (21 thousand km²) and Alagoas (27 thousand km²). The period coincides with the mandate of former president Jair Bolsonaro, who used to discredit data on deforestation. The Minister of the Environment, Marina Silva, has been making statements about forest preservation. In one of the first measures, the Amazon Fund was unlocked, which counts on donations from Germany and Norway to be applied in environmental protection actions. ""We hope that this was the last deforestation record reported by our satellite monitoring system, since the new government has promised to give priority to protecting the Amazon"" said researcher Bianca Santos, from Imazon, in the material released today. The institute highlighted the jump in deforestation recorded in December, a month in which 287 km² of forest were cut down, an increase of 150% compared to the same month in 2021 (140 km²) and the worst last month of the year of any historical series. ""In the last month of the year there was an unbridled race to deforest while the gate was open for the cattle, for land speculation, for illegal mining and deforestation in indigenous lands and conservation units. This shows the size of the challenge of the new government"", said Carlos Souza Jr, Amazon monitoring coordinator at the institute, in the publicity material. About 80% of the area deforested in 2022 is in lands under the responsibility of the federal government (8,443 km²). Another 11% of destroyed territory is under the jurisdiction of state governments (1,130 km²). Also according to the report, the state that deforested the most in 2022 was Pará (3089 km²), followed by Amazonas (2270 km²) and Mato Grosso (1228 km²). Last Thursday, the directors of the National Council of Extrativist Populations (CNS), the Chico Mendes Memorial (MCM) and the Chico Mendes Committee presented their demands and recommendations in favor of forest peoples to Marina, in Brasília. One of the issues discussed was the dismantling of Extractive Reserves (RESEXs) and Conservation Units (UCs) in the Amazon, such as the RESEXs Chico Mendes and Verde Para Sempre, located in Acre and Pará, respectively. According to CNS president Júlio Barbosa, the meeting with Marina was a great opportunity to align alliances that bring dignity to the forest peoples. ""If the government looks at these two reserves and tries to solve their problems definitively, we are sure that this will have a very positive effect on the other reserves in the Amazon"", he explains. Another point exposed was the evasion of leaders to the big cities, hindering the dialogue of unification against predatory activities in the region. Despite the problems, Marina Silva's experience and commitment to social agendas increase hopes for a renewal. ""She was very receptive to our movement and we believe that we will begin to build a great alliance between the rubber tapper and extractivist movements in the Amazon and the Ministry of the Environment, for a fairer Amazon"", declares Júlio.

2022-11-15,Lula arrived at the climate change summit and there is expectation for an announcement of zero deforestation in the Amazon,514,"In the midst of new coup demonstrations in front of barracks in several Brazilian cities, President-elect Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva arrived on Tuesday in Egypt to participate in the COP27 conference on climate change. The president-elect is scheduled to meet with U.S. special envoy John Kerry and to make announcements about his policy on the Amazon. His official agenda will take place on Wednesday and Thursday in the Egyptian city of Sharm el Sheik. According to the Brazilian newspapers O Globo and Folha de Sao Paulo, the president-elect will announce new goals for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and proclaim his commitment to ""zero deforestation"" in the Amazon. According to the São Paulo newspaper, Lula also plans to propose that his country host COP30, to be held in 2025. Lula's first trip abroad after his election victory Lula arrived in Sharm el Sheik accompanied by the former mayor of Sao Paulo, Fernando Haddad, the main candidate to take over as foreign minister in his future government, which will begin on January 1. His wife Rosángela Janja Silva also traveled. The president-elect will be advised at the summit by former environment ministers Marina Silva and Izabella Teixeira and by Senator Randolfe Rodrigues. Lula lleva a la cumbre del cambio climático su compromiso de deforestación cero en el Amazonas (Foto: EFE) Rodrigues is also a member of the transition team, which on Monday denounced the failure of President Jair Bolsonaro's administration to provide the latest data on deforestation in the Amazon. Lula is the personality most expected this week at the summit by an international community that is betting on a radical change in Brazilian environmental policy. Environmentalists denounced a strong advance in the deforestation of the Amazon during the administration of outgoing president Jair Bolsonaro. New coup expressions in Brazil: thousands of people demand military intervention in front of barracks While Lula arrived in Egypt to participate in the climate summit, thousands of Brazilians gathered this Tuesday in front of Army commands in Rio de Janeiro, Brasilia and other cities, asking for a military intervention against Lula da Silva's electoral victory on October 30. On a national holiday, thousands of Brazilians dressed in the green and yellow colors of the national flag gathered in the morning in front of the Eastern Military Command, the main Army headquarters in this region, in the center of the city of Rio de Janeiro. Miles de personas pidieron a las Fuerzas Armadas una intervención militar contra Lula (Foto: AP) ""We don't want Lula to take command on January 1st, we don't want a communist country, we want a better Brazil,"" banker Lais Nunes, 30, told AFP during the demonstration. Many carried the Brazilian flag and sang the national anthem every time it was played from a truck with loudspeakers. ""There are several reports that there was fraud in the elections (...) we cannot accept that"", said policeman Leandro de Oliveira, 38, who attributes the fraud to an alleged conspiracy by the Superior Electoral Court (TSE) to favor the former president. These arguments have already been denied by authorities and international observers. InBrasilia thousands of people also gathered in front of the Army Headquarters, carrying banners with slogans such as ""S.O.S. Armed Forces"" or ""audit at the polls"". Security was reinforced in the central region of Brasília this Tuesday after the call for protests through social networks. Police ""preventively"" restricted the access of vehicles and pedestrians to the Three Powers Square, where the buildings of the Presidency, the Congress and the Supreme Court are located, according to the Federal District Security Secretariat."
2023-02-10,Lula da Silva carries out an intense agenda in Washington before meeting with Joe Biden,515,"The President of Brazil, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, arrived in Washington as part of his first visit to the country after returning to the Presidency of the South American giant. He is accompanied by Ministers Mauro Vieira, of Foreign Affairs; Fernando Haddad, of Finance; Marina Silva, of Environment; Anielle Franco, of Racial Equality; Ambassador Celso Amorim; the Secretary of the Ministry of Economic Development and Trade, Marcio Elias Rosa; and Senator Jaques Wagner. Lula's visit to the United States, just at the beginning of his term in office and at the invitation of President Biden, marks the resumption of relations between the two countries, which will celebrate 200 years of diplomacy in 2024, according to a press release published by the official website of the Brazilian Presidency. ""Two of the world's largest democracies, Brazil and the United States, face similar challenges related to political radicalization and hate speech in the virtual space. Also at the center of the agenda is the reactivation of Brazil's commitment to environmental conservation and the search for a greater commitment from developed countries to fulfill their climate finance commitments,"" he says. Before the expected meeting with Joe Biden this Friday, Lula will have a full agenda, since he will meet with Senator Bernie Sanders, with congressmen and congresswomen of the Democratic Party, and also with representatives of the largest trade union federation in the United States, AFL-CIO. He will return to Brazil on Saturday at noon. The Brazilian Executive indicated that, in the economic sphere, ""efforts are being made to promote investments, particularly in energy transition and clean energy generation, and greater integration of production chains. The United States is Brazil's second largest trading partner and the main destination for our exports of industrialized products,"" he said. One of the unknowns is whether Biden will use the visit with Lula to announce what would be the first U.S. contribution to the Amazon Fund, which was created in 2009 to help combat deforestation in the Amazon and was financed mainly with contributions from Norway and Germany. Norway and Germany froze their contributions to that fund with the advance of Amazon deforestation under the government of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro (2019-2023); but have expressed their desire to resume them already with Lula in power. Beyond the Amazon, the other major theme of the meeting will be the defense of democracy, especially after Bolsonaro's supporters stormed the headquarters of the three branches of government in Brasilia on January 8. According to a high-ranking official consulted by EFE news agency, the two leaders will discuss democracy in their own countries, but will also talk more broadly about initiatives to strengthen it regionally and around the world, including the so-called ""Democracy Summit"" promoted by Biden and to be held in March of this year. Lula will hold a meeting with Biden at the White House with the war in Ukraine as a focus of tension.

2022-12-05,Lula faces stiff challenge to fulfil vow to reverse Amazon deforestation in Brazil,516,"Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva’s narrow victory over President Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil ’s October elections was hailed as the potential salvation of the Amazon, after four years of unbridled destruction which have brought the rainforest close to a tipping point, threatening the very survival of the Indigenous populations whose lives depend upon it. Lula has vowed to reverse the environmental destruction wreaked under his far-right predecessor and work towards zero deforestation by tackling crime in the Amazon and guaranteeing the protection of Indigenous rights. But the president-elect, who takes office on 1 January 2023, faces an uphill battle to meet these big promises he has made to the Brazilian people and the international community. “Lula is going to face the challenge of how to be ambitious on climate issues, and at the same time be effective, meet the pledges that are being made,” said Natalie Unterstell, president of climate policy thinktank Instituto Talanoa. “Brazil’s climate leadership will have to be rebuilt on the basis of results, not just of talk.” The incoming government’s priorities will be to rebuild and strengthen the state’s environmental institutions, which have been gutted under Bolsonaro, and acknowledge the vital conservation role played by Indigenous Brazilians, whose rights have come under unprecedented assault. There is talk of creating a ministry of Indigenous peoples. Lula’s government will also have to contend with increasingly violent and diversified crime in the Amazon, with loggers, land grabbers, illegal miners and other criminals emboldened by Bolsonaro’s laissez-faire attitude. “Deforestation is just the tip of the iceberg, there are many illicit economies and many actors with a level of organisation, sophistication and violence that is much higher than when Lula’s previous administrations saw big successes in reducing deforestation,” said Ilona Szabó of the Instituto Igarapé, a thinktank focused on public and climate security. The environmental working group in Lula’s transition team – which includes Marina Silva, the environment minister who oversaw a sharp drop in deforestation during Lula’s first term and is tipped to perhaps reprise her old role – has indicated that environmental law enforcement will be a priority and has spoken of tackling deforestation in Brazil’s other biomes. “Apathy, impunity are over,” Aloizio Mercadante, a coordinator on the transition team, said in a recent press conference. Amazon deforestation totalled 11,568 sq km in the year from August 2021 through to July 2022, the national space agency INPE’s recent annual deforestation report showed – an 11% decrease on the previous year but still the second highest figure since 2008. Across the four years spanning Bolsonaro’s time in office, an area more than twice the size of Wales (over 45,000 sq km) was cleared in the Amazon. Deforestation and land use change are the biggest contributors to Brazil’s greenhouse gas emissions, which grew 12.2% overall last year according to the Climate Observatory watchdog. The destruction of the country’s biomes accounted for 1.19bn tonnes of the total 2.16bn tonnes of CO 2 equivalent the South American giant emitted in 2021. Bringing down deforestation levels is therefore of primordial importance if Brazil is to reduce its overall emissions and meet internationally agreed targets. All this will require funds – another major challenge for the incoming government as Brazil’s mandatory expenses and fiscal rules give it very little room to increase environmental budgets. The transition team is currently in discussions with congress to exclude certain expenses – including foreign donations destined to the environmental agenda – from a constitutionally mandated spending cap. Although the task ahead is immense, Lula will benefit from a positive scenario internationally, said Márcio Astrini, the chief executive of the Climate Observatory. The president-elect was given a hero’s welcome at the Cop27 climate summit in Sharm el-Sheikh in November, where he announced that “Brazil is back” in the fight against the climate crisis. Germany and Norway signalled that they would restart donations to the Amazon Fund, an important tool in combatting deforestation that has been paralysed under the Bolsonaro government, after the supreme court ordered the fund’s reactivation shortly after the election. Lula’s victory is also understood to have spurred talks with Indonesia and the Democratic Republic of Congo – the two other big tropical rainforest nations – over coordinating conservation efforts. Both Unterstell and Szabó said that continued international support will depend on the incoming Lula government delivering results promptly and being transparent about its policies and the obstacles it meets along the way. “Lula is not going to work miracles in the Amazon,” Astrini conceded, adding that there was unlikely to be a significant decrease in deforestation within Lula’s first year – partly because the next annual dataset will include the last five months of Bolsonaro’s government, during which forest clearing looks set to hit new records. But, Astrini said, after Bolsonaro’s “environmental hell”, Lula represents the “concrete hope” that the Amazon can be protected and that Brazil will return to the international fight against the climate crisis."
2022-11-17,Lula pledges at Cop27 to halt Amazon deforestation,517,"“Brazil is back” and will do whatever it takes to achieve zero deforestation in the Amazon rainforest, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has told the Cop27 climate conference in Egypt. The Brazilian president-elect told a cheering audience that tackling climate change would be one of his government’s highest priorities, adding that the world would have no climate security without the Amazon being protected. Deforestation rose to a 15-year high under his defeated election rival, President Bolsonaro. In his first big speech on the international stage since his victory, Lula said tackling global warming required countries to act together because “alone we are vulnerable to the climate tragedy”. Brazil would like to host the 2025 UN climate conference somewhere within the Amazon, he said. The biggest city in the rainforest is Manaus, a former rubber boom town with an opera house. Lula told delegates at Cop27 in Sharm el-Sheikh that his country was once again open to financial contributions to a fund to protect the rainforest. Donors including Germany and Norway stopped sending contributions to the Amazon Fund after it was frozen under Bolsonaro’s presidency, but Lula said both countries had indicated they would resume payments. He said payments worth about $500 million, frozen since 2019, would be unlocked. “We are open to international co-operation,” he said, but added Brazil would not give up any sovereignty over the rainforest. Under his leadership, nature would be a “strategic ally”, not an enemy to be “knocked down by tractors and chainsaws”, he said. Lula’s arrival at Cop27 gave a boost to the atmosphere at the UN climate talks, where negotiations appear to have stalled on key issues including deeper emissions cuts and the principle of rich countries  eventually compensating  poorer ones for extreme weather impacts such as  Pakistan’s recent floods . Lungs of the Earth breathe sigh of relief at Lula’s election victory Lula, who is of the left, was greeted with cheers of “olé, olé, olé” before he used his speech to say that the world’s richest 1 per cent were responsible for a disproportionate amount of carbon emissions. He urged wealthy countries to make good on their promise of delivering $100 billion a year of climate finance by 2020, after the latest figures showed only $83 billion a year was being sent to poorer countries. Lula also said that the global world order was no longer working when it came to cutting emissions. “The world needs new global governance on the climate issue,” he said."
2022-11-16,Lula tells COP27 'Brazil is back' as he vows to end deforestation in the Amazon,518,"Brazilian President-elect Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva received a warm welcome at COP27 today.  Hundreds of people gathered to see him arrive at a side event early on Wednesday with crowds chanting his name.  Later in the day, he addressed a packed room at the UN climate conference.  Lula said that ""Brazil is once again ready to join efforts to build a healthier planet,"" referencing the recent election as ""one of the most decisive in history"".  ""The survival of the Amazon also depended on the election. Civilisation and values are back. The respect and human rights are back,"" he added.  Lula criticised world leaders for ignoring warnings about climate change and spending ""trillions of dollars"" on war ""that only result in destruction and death.""  Lula's pledge to end deforestation in the Amazon rainforest After his election victory, Lula pledged to reduce deforestation in the Amazon to zero. He once again brought up this pledge at COP27. ""There is no climate security for the world without a protected Amazon,"" he said adding that Brazil will ""do whatever it takes to have zero deforestation and degradation of our biomes.""  He announced that the fight against climate change will have the highest priority in his government - particularly the fight against deforestation.  Lula claimed that environmental crime had grown in a ""scary way"" under the previous government and said he would strengthen bodies to punish illegal activities including gold mining, logging and farming.  The President-elect also announced that Brazil would set up a ministry for Indigenous people so that those affected most by these issues would ""have a voice of their own.""  What else did Lula say at COP27? Lula made two proposals during his speech at COP27. The first was that Amazon countries come together to look at the development of the region in an integrated way.  He is seeking a world alliance for food security and the reduction of inequality. First on the list are countries like Indonesia and the Democratic Republic of Congo which, together with Brazil, have more than half of the world's primary tropical forests.  The other was for COP30 in 2025 to be hosted in Brazil - particularly the Amazon region. He hopes that this would help people to really understand the importance of this part of the world.  When Brazil chairs the G20 meeting in 2024, climate will be top of the agenda. Promises of $100 billion in climate finance also came under scrutiny with Lula saying wealthy nations must deliver on their pledges from COP15 in Copenhagen.  Touching on another hot topic at this year's UN climate conference, he called for progress on a fund for loss and damage saying that ""we cannot postpone this debate...it is time to act."""
NA,NA,519,"End of Document SHARM EL-SHEIJ, Egypt (AP) - Six weeks before his swearing-in, Brazilian President-elect Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva began a series of public appearances and meetings Wednesday at the U.N. climate summit in Egypt. Upon Lula's arrival at a pavilion, hundreds of people awaited him, many of whom cheered him and chanted slogans in Portuguese. The appearance of Lula, who last year staged an extraordinary return to the political limelight after a stint in jail for corruption, was probably one of the events that injected the most energy into the COP27 conference. During Lula's first presidency, from 2003 to 2010, deforestation of the Brazilian rainforest was greatly reduced, and he has promised to do so again. After meeting with several Brazilian governors, including those from rainforest states such as Amazonia and Para, Lula addressed a brief speech to the crowd. ""You know that we are going to undertake a great fight against deforestation,"" he said amid applause. Lula criticized President Jair Bolsonaro, who pushed for economic development in the Amazon, several times, both in his pro-business rhetoric and in the way he managed the forests. Lula defeated Bolsonaro in the October elections and will take office on January 1. ""Brazil cannot remain isolated as in the last four years, (Brazilian officials) did not travel to other countries and no other country traveled to Brazil,"" Lula said. On Tuesday night, Lula and U.S. envoy John Kerry met to discuss measures against climate change and deforestation, according to a statement from a State Department spokesman to The Associated Press. Lula is scheduled to meet with ministers from several countries. Under Bolsonaro, who was elected in 2018, environmental regulatory agencies in the Amazon were weakened. Bolsonaro, a former army captain, appointed administrators from the agribusiness sector, which opposes the creation of indigenous territories and other protected areas and pushes for the legalization of land theft. The deforested area of the Brazilian Amazon reached its highest extent in 15 years between August 2020 and July 2021, according to official figures. Satellite monitoring indicates that the trend is even greater this year. Lula did not refer to newspaper reports that Brazil is facing a possible alliance with Congo and Indonesia, where the world's largest tropical forests are located. Under the slogan ""OPEC of the Forests"" in reference to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and the way it regulates production, the idea would be for the three countries to coordinate their negotiating positions and practices on forest management and biodiversity protection. The proposal was presented last year during the climate summit in Glasgow, Scotland, according to reports. Despite Lula's promises, his government faces a daunting task. Many people, especially environmentalists and officials, celebrate promises to protect the Amazon at a climate conference like this one, but the pressures on the government to push for economic development are enormous. These come both from agriculture and mining and from many Amazonians who feel it is up to them to decide how it is used. It is also a reality that Lula has a mixed record on environmental issues. Deforestation fell dramatically during his first term in office when Marina Silva was the environment minister. But in the second, Lula began to seek the support of the agribusiness sector, and Marina Silva resigned in 2008. She is at COP27 and is being mentioned to take up the post again. Simone Karipuna, an Amazon activist present at COP27 and who attended Lua's speech, expressed hope that difficulties will be overcome because indigenous communities can work with the incoming government. ""We had no dialogue with the current government,"" she said. ____ The Associated Press' climate and environmental coverage is supported by several private foundations.

2022-10-19,"Mennonites lead fragmented deforestation in Peruvian Amazon, report says",520,"LIMA, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Groups belonging to the Mennonites have positioned themselves as a notable source of deforestation in the Peruvian Amazon, having cleared an area close to the size of Manhattan since 2017, according to a new study. Estimates from the Monitoring the Andean Amazon Project (MAAP) suggest that deforestation near Mennonite settlements has reached 659 hectares (1,628 acres) so far this year, while 98,400 hectares across the Peruvian Amazon have been affected. Although small-scale agriculture and illegal gold mining continue to account for more than 99% of deforestation in the Peruvian Amazon so far this year, MAAP director Matt Finer told Reuters that this deforestation near Mennonite camps deserved scrutiny. ""Most of the deforestation in the Peruvian Amazon is small-scale,"" Finer said. ""But in terms of having a major entity that is responsible for this amount of deforestation, that's pretty rare."" Since 2017, MAAP estimates that deforestation linked to Mennonites has reached 4,800 hectares (11,861 acres), which corresponds to four-fifths the size of Manhattan Island in New York. The Mennonites are an isolated Christian group that has spread around the world. They say they lead a peaceful life and that the expansion of their agriculture is God's will and a way to provide their families with a simple life. They could not be reached for comment on the above report on deforestation. Peru has the world's second largest section of the Amazon, the world's largest rainforest whose preservation is considered critical to mitigating climate change. Most of the Peruvian rainforest is sparsely populated and inaccessible, which has contributed to its conservation so far. Deforestation in the Peruvian Amazon has remained relatively stable in recent years, with a significant peak in 2020 during the first year of the pandemic. ""It's an entity that can continue to expand ... I think that's what makes this concerning, and not just the current deforestation,"" Finer said, ""but the potential for continued escalation of deforestation."" Mennonite settlements have drawn the attention of Peruvian authorities for their possible involvement in illegal deforestation, according to Mongabay, an environmental news organization. The Mennonites have also aroused suspicions in Mexico linked to deforestation, detailed in a recent Reuters report (Report by Marcelo Rochabrun Edited in Spanish by Aida Peláez-Fernández)."
2022-12-01,NGOs reject mediation with French group Casino for deforestation in the Amazon,521,"Eleven international, Brazilian and Colombian NGOs that accuse the French supermarket chain Casino of indirectly participating in deforestation in the Amazon refused, on Thursday (1), a judicial mediation and expect the case to be decided in the courts. ""The eleven organizations that filed a lawsuit against Casino rejected the mediation proposed"" in June by a French judge, the coalition formed by environmental groups and indigenous federations said in a statement. ""This matter must imperatively be the subject of public debate and a judicial ruling,"" it added. ""The case cannot be resolved through a solution negotiated behind closed doors and, moreover, confidential,"" the document stressed. Among the organizations are Sherpa, Mighty Eearth, Envol vert, the Coordination of Indigenous Organizations of the Brazilian Amazon (Coiab) and the National Organization of Indigenous Peoples of the Colombian Amazon (Opiac). All accuse Casino of failing to comply with its mission to monitor and respect human and environmental rights throughout its supply chain. Casino said it ""takes note"" of the complainants' refusal to enter into a negotiation to which it had declared itself ""favorable"" and reiterated, in a comment to AFP, ""the conformity of its surveillance plan with respect to French legislation."" The denunciation is based on a report published in June by the French-Colombian NGO Envol vert. This document links four farms involved in illegal deforestation in the Amazon and Cerrado in Brazil to 52 products sold in the group's ""stores and butcher stores."" ""These farms alone represent 4,500 hectares of illegally cleared forests to make room for cattle ranching. The same occurred with protected indigenous lands,"" the report highlights. Casino has in total more than 11,000 supermarkets. In Brazil, its subsidiary is the Pão de Açúcar group (GPA) and in Colombia, the Exito network. Since March 2017, French law has required companies based in France and employing more than 5,000 people or more than 10,000 worldwide to adopt effective measures to prevent human rights violations and damage to the environment. When the complaint was filed in June, the French multinational assured that its subsidiaries are among ""the most advanced companies in the sector in the fight against deforestation."""
2022-12-21,Ombudsman's Office requests Congress to file bill that would encourage deforestation in the Amazon,522,"The Ombudsman's Office expressed its rejection of the opinion approved by the Agrarian Commission of the Congress of the Republic that insists on the approval of three bills, as it indicates that it would promote deforestation in the Amazon. Through a press release, the organization detailed that these are bills N° 649/2021-CR, N° 894/2021-CR and N° 2315/2021-CR, which aim to modify the Forestry and Wildlife Law. He said that 94% of the country's forests are located in the Amazon and are ""a source of identity and life"" for around 370,000 indigenous inhabitants that make up more than 2,700 communities. They also explained that more than 80% of deforestation in the country is generated by agricultural activities. In view of this, they request a sanction for those informal holders of these deforested lands and to provide ""adequate land to promote these activities"". ""It is of the utmost importance that all state powers, including Congress, take measures to guarantee their conservation"", the organization indicated. In relation to the insistence ruling and the autograph, the Ombudsman's Office specifies that they would aggravate the problem and encourage informal possession of Amazonian forests and would violate the rights of indigenous peoples. It added that this measure would exonerate from administrative, criminal and civil responsibilities in forestry and agrarian matters those who have proof of possession and property titles on deforested lands. In another point, they emphasized that the Ministry of Agrarian Development and Irrigation (Midagri) will be the public entity that ""will approve the forest zoning"", which allows the allocation of forest land uses. It should be noted that the Ministry of Environment is the governing entity in charge of environmental material and environmental land use planning. ""An eventual promulgation of the insistence opinion or of the observed autograph will contravene the constitutional mandates of the State to promote the sustainable use of natural resources and biological diversity. In addition, it will violate a set of individual and collective rights,"" the communiqué concludes."
2022-11-11,Record deforestation in the Amazon in October,523,"The deforested area in the Amazon in October of this year was 903.86 km². The number is the highest ever recorded by Deter, a program of Inpe (National Institute for Space Research), which began in 2015. Last Friday (4), the partial number, updated through October 28, was 813.2 km², but the expectation was that the deforested area could still increase. The record deforestation for October becomes public amid Brazil's participation in COP27, the UN (United Nations) conference on climate change. On Monday (7), the country stayed out of the Leaders' Partnership for Forests and Climate. The initiative includes 26 countries, some of them Amazon countries, such as Colombia and Ecuador, and the European Union. Itamaraty justified the absence by stating, in a note, that there are forums with a better format to ""address the needs of developing countries"". Brazil leads the way in the cutting down of forests. The release of the Prodes deforestation rate, the INPE program that measures the annual deforestation in the biome, is also expected soon. Last year, the Prodes data was already available during the COP26, but was only released by the Bolsonaro government after the event. Last year's October rate, also a record, was published during Brazil's participation in the COP in Glasgow, but the Minister of the Environment, Joaquim Leite, said at the time that he was unaware of the data. The Deter is not intended to measure deforestation, but to assist public policies to combat deforestation. However, from its data it is possible to observe destruction tendencies. However, the high rates registered by Deter may indicate that Prodes will also publish high data. All the highest monthly deforestation figures recorded by Deter up to October this year occurred under Bolsonaro's administration. The recent historical data starts in 2015, when there was an upgrade in the Deter program's sensors that makes it impossible to make a proper comparison with previous years, where there was lower accuracy."
2022-10-07,Record deforestation in the Amazon in September,524,"The Amazon had its worst September of deforestation in the recent history of Inpe (National Institute for Space Research). The Deter program recorded 1,454 km² of deforestation in the biome. The value narrowly exceeds the 1,453 km² recorded in September 2019, which was, until now, the worst September ever recorded by Inpe. The recent historical series of Deter starts in 2015. Before that, there was already Deter monitoring, but, due to the improvement in deforestation detection sensors, comparisons with previous periods are not valid. The deforestation recorded in September is equivalent to more than 900 Ibirapuera parks in São Paulo. Ramal em meio a área desmatada e queimada Ramal em meio a área desmatada e queimada Recent deforestation in the municipality of Apuí, in southern Amazonas - Lalo de Almeida - 20.Aug.2020/Folhapress  The Deter's main objective is not to measure deforestation in the biome. Its function is to detect deforestation almost in real time to help the environmental agencies' inspection operations. However, from the Deter it is possible to observe deforestation trends within a year. In the Amazon there has been a sequence of negative data for the biome. Besides the record deforestation, September was also the worst month in terms of fires in more than a decade, according to data from Inpe's Burning Program. There were more than 41 thousand fires in the forest in September this year. The figure of 40 thousand fires had not been reached since 2010, when more than 43 thousand fires were registered in the biome. The Planeta em Transe project is supported by the Open Society Foundations."
2022-10-10,Record-breaking deforestation registered in the Amazon ahead of presidential elections in Brazil,525,"Canada: Greenpeace International has issued the following press release: According to alerts from the Brazilian Space Research Institute (INPE) ’ s system DETER, 1,455 km2 is the largest area of deforestation in the Amazon ever recorded for the month of September. 2022 has seen record-breaking numbers of fires and deforestation. The data shows an increase of 48% compared to the same month last year. From January to September 8,590 km2 of the Amazon was deforested this year, equivalent to 11 times the size of New York City. Cristiane Mazzetti, spokesperson for Greenpeace Brazil, said: “In recent years, the Bolsonaro government has shown a complete disregard for a safe climate and for the Amazon rainforest, Indigenous Peoples and traditional communities. His administration has actively promoted an anti-environment, anti-Indigenous, and anti-democratic agenda that has resulted in a severe increase in carbon emissions and that paints a grave scenario in Brazil. This destructive project cannot continue. ” The current government ’ s actions have encouraged violence in the rainforest against both Indigenous Peoples and environmental defenders. According to a report published by NGO CIMI, 176 Indigenous People were murdered in 2021. Brazil also continues to be one of the most dangerous countries for environmentalists, according to a report by Global Witness. Over 17% of the entire Amazon Basin has already been deforested, and this massive destruction is pushing the forest closer to a tipping point. If 20 to 25% of the Amazon is lost, it would fail as an ecosystem, according to research done by scientists Carlos Nobre and Thomas Lovejoy. Mazzetti said: “The current government has been causing irreversible damage to the environment in Brazil and is a threat to the climate globally. In only three weeks, Brazilians will go to the polls to choose our next president, and our choice will have a tremendous impact on the country, on the forest, and on the climate. Continuing the current agenda means accelerating the collapse of the Amazon instead of using the little time we have to avoid it. Brazilians must reflect deeply on their choice in the presidential elections and vote for climate, for the forest, and for a green, safe and just future. ”"
2022-10-28,Reports Summarize Remote Sensing Research from State University (Deforestation Detection in the Amazon Using DeepLabv3+ Semantic Segmentation Model Variants),526,"2022 OCT 28 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Biotech News Daily -- Data detailed on remote sensing have been presented. According to news originating from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, ""The Amazon rainforest spreads across nine countries and covers nearly one-third of South America, being 69% inside Brazilian borders. It represents more than half of the remaining tropical forest on Earth and covers the catchment basin of the Amazon river on which 20% of the surface fresh water on the planet flows.""   Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from State University: ""Such an ecosystem produces large quantities of water vapor, helping regulate rainfall regimes in most of South America, with strong economic implications: for instance, by irrigating crops and pastures, and supplying water for the main hydroelectric plants in the continent. Being the natural habitat of one-tenth of the currently known species, the Amazon also has enormous biotechnological potential. Among the major menaces to the Amazon is the extension of agricultural and cattle farming, forest fires, illegal mining and logging, all directly associated with deforestation. Preserving the Amazon is obviously essential, and it is well-known that remote sensing provides effective tools for environmental monitoring. This work presents a deforestation detection approach based on the DeepLabv3+, a fully convolutional deep learning model devised for semantic segmentation. The proposed method extends the original DeepLabv3+ model, aiming at properly dealing with a strong class imbalanced problem and improving the delineation quality of deforestation polygons. Experiments were devised to evaluate the proposed method in terms of the sensitivity to the weighted focal loss hyperparameters-through an extensive grid search-and the amount of training data, and compared its performance to previous deep learning methods proposed for deforestation detection. Landsat OLI-8 images of a specific region in the Amazon were used in such evaluation. The results indicate that the variants of the proposed method outperformed previous works in terms of the F1-score and Precision metrics.""   According to the news reporters, the research concluded: ""Additionally, more substantial performance gains were observed in the context of smaller volumes of training data. When the evaluated methods were trained using four image tiles, the proposed method outperformed its counterparts by approximately +10% in terms of F1-score (from 63% to 73%); when the methods were trained with only one image tile, the performance difference in terms of F1-score achieved approximately +18% (from 49% to 67%).""

2022-11-05,Rio Branco and Tarauacá join preventive actions for monitoring and deforestation in the Amazon,527,"An ordinance of the Ministry of Environment, includes two Acre cities in the list of priority municipalities for actions to prevent and control deforestation in the Amazon. According to the ordinance, which was published in the Official Gazette of the Union on Thursday, 3, the Acre capital, Rio Branco, and the municipality of Tarauacá, as well as cities in Amazonas, Rondônia, Pará, and Mato Grosso, will now be part of these actions. The forest engineer, and technical coordinator of the State Secretariat of Environment and Indigenous Policies (Semapi), Quelyson Souza de Lima, talked about the preventive action to fight environmental crimes. We are working in the environmental monitoring room, which has the task of generating alerts for deforestation and forest fires in the state. And, even though this ordinance has only recently come into effect, the municipalities of Tarauacá and Rio Branco, as well as Feijó, are already our target control points. The alerts in recent years have always indicated that these cities are the most problematic in relation to these issues& he pointed out. The public servant highlighted that the focus is on inspection, however, public policies aimed at environmental education are essential. & people, we will have good practices and decrease criminal practices&. The coordinator pointed out that, of the total number of inspections in the state, 43 are integrated with other state security agencies and 10 with federal agencies, 53 in total. & to point out that in 2022, the biggest fires were in Feijó, with 21%, Tarauacá, with 14%, Sena Madureira, with 10%, and Rio Branco, with 9,3%& concluded Quelyson."
2022-10-07,September sees worst-ever deforestation rate in Amazon,528,"LONDON Ahead of Brazil's second-round presidential race later this month, Brazilian authorities have registered the worst deforestation levels in Amazon for the month of September. According to the Brazilian Space Research Institute (INPE), 1,455 square kilometers (562 square miles) of rainforest were destroyed in September 2022 &ndash; an area almost twice the size of New York City. The September 2022 record breaks the previous record for September 2019 when 1,454 km2 were destroyed. This year the Amazon has experienced a number of records broken for fires and deforestation, as from January-September 8,590 km&sup2; of it were deforested - roughly 11 times the size of New York City, according to Greenpeace. Over the past three years, an area larger than Belgium has been destroyed in the Amazon, as many environmentalists and defenders of Indigenous peoples and their territorial rights have criticized Brazil President Jair Bolsonaro's policies, insisting he has rolled back environmental protections, causing ecological destruction as illegal loggers, miners and ranchers have cleared large swathes of land. &ldquo;In recent years, the Bolsonaro government has shown complete disregard for a safe climate and for the Amazon rainforest, Indigenous Peoples and traditional communities,"" according to Cristiane Mazzetti, spokesperson for Greenpeace Brazil. In a press release, Mazzetti added Bolsonaro administration ""has actively promoted an anti-environment, anti-Indigenous and anti-democratic agenda that has resulted in a severe increase in carbon emissions and that paints a grave scenario in Brazil."" Paul Morozzo, a senior food and forests campaigner at Greenpeace UK, underscored the importance the Amazon plays in humanity's ""fight against the climate crisis&rdquo;. With more than 17% of the entire Amazon basin lost to deforestation, the destruction is pushing it towards a tipping point. According to scientists Carlos Nobre and Thomas Lovejoy, if 20 to 25% of the Amazon is lost, it would fail to act as an ecosystem. Ahead of the second round presidential vote, experts have warned that the future of the Amazon is at stake between the two radically opposed views from both presidential candidates. Far-right President Bolsonaro wishes to open up the Amazon for development while left-wing Luiz In&aacute;cio Lula da Silva who brought down deforestation during his previous tenure as Brazil's president has pledged to create an Indigenous Affairs Ministry, stop illegal gold prospecting in the Amazon, and rebuild the Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (IBAMA) environmental agency. Brazilians return to the polls for the second round on Oct. 30."
2022-12-16,The Hope For Slowing Amazon Deforestation,529," (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)  EMILY KWONG: You're listening to SHORT WAVE from NPR.  AARON SCOTT: Hey there, SHORT WAVErs. Aaron Scott here with NPR correspondent Kirk Siegler. Hello, Kirk.  KIRK SIEGLER: Hey, Aaron.  AARON SCOTT: You are fresh back from an epic reporting trip. Tell us about where you've been.  KIRK SIEGLER: I was lucky enough to travel into the Brazilian Amazon as part of a U.N. Foundation reporting fellowship, where a few of us journalists from around the world traveled into a place called Camp 41, which is a remote research camp about 80 miles north of the Amazonian capital of Manaus, where scientists have been studying the effects of deforestation on the rainforest since the '80s.  AARON SCOTT: And are we talking, like, a series of buildings in the forest here? Describe the camp to us.  KIRK SIEGLER: I would say maybe glamping adjacent.  AARON SCOTT: OK.  KIRK SIEGLER: I think we had running water, if you count running water being pipes directly from the stream. But we also had great food. We had a kitchen area and cooks. And we slept in hammocks, which was an experience in and of itself. Getting up in the middle of the night, if you needed to use the toilet, to make the trek with your headlamp on - have to be very, very aware of critters hiding in your shoes that you step into, to a few snake sightings out by the toilets. Fortunately, I didn't actually see any of them.  AARON SCOTT: And so sleeping in hammocks, glamping-adjacent kitchen, but then a bunch of scientists doing research. Tell us a little bit about their actual work. And did you get to kind of trek into the forest with them?  KIRK SIEGLER: We did. So there are these series of paths that fan out into the jungle where researchers have been looking at the effects of deforestation on habitat, what they call a fragmented forest. That is, like, forests that have been cut down - can certain bird species survive across that? Can they move to another part of the jungle that hasn't been deforested? But lately, much of the work that's going on there at Camp 41 is looking at the effects of deforestation on the global climate.  AARON SCOTT: And this is a huge topic because, I mean, for the longest time, the Amazon has absorbed more carbon dioxide than it emits. But then there was this big study that came out last year in the journal Nature that says, due to deforestation, that might have flipped, and the Amazon might actually now be emitting more carbon dioxide than it absorbs. So are we at a tipping point here when it comes to the Amazon, Kirk?  KIRK SIEGLER: Well, it's so interesting that you use that phrase because that phrase comes up all the time when you're there, and there isn't really a definitive answer as to whether or not we are. One scientist may say we are; the other not, we may still have more time. But the Amazon is one of the world's last remaining megaforests, and it's the most biodiverse place still on the planet. And it does act still, despite all the deforestation, as this big carbon sink that absorbs all the harmful CO2 gases in the atmosphere. So as we cut more of it down, that actually affects the climate elsewhere, like where you and I are talking in the Pacific Northwest, where we're seeing more wildfires. There's a real increasingly connection between the two, and that's what scientists are trying to study more about and make definitive conclusions about so they can better inform the public, of course.   (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)  AARON SCOTT: Today on the show, Kirk Siegler heads to a remote research station in the Amazon to look into the future of the forest. I'm Aaron Scott, and this is SHORT WAVE, the daily science podcast from NPR.   (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)  AARON SCOTT: So, Kirk, will you set the scene for us? The journey to Camp 41 - what was it like?  KIRK SIEGLER: Well, we had to travel about 80 miles overland out of the capital of Manaus, which is this huge city, dead center in the middle of the Amazonian jungle. But pretty quickly, do the pavement roads fade away to dirt and, in our case, slick mud. It took us seven hours to go about 80 miles...  AARON SCOTT: Wow.  KIRK SIEGLER: ...Just to get to this camp. And in a few spots, you or I sitting in these 4x4s jarring around, peering over a ledge, would think, OK, so I'm not going to get to go to Camp 41 on this trip. This is just too hazardous.  AARON SCOTT: (Laughter).  KIRK SIEGLER: But each time, our skilled Brazilian drivers, who have a lot of experience driving through hazardous conditions in the bush, would get us down some embankment that was basically itself a mudslide.   (SOUNDBITE OF CHAINSAW)  KIRK SIEGLER: And listen; you can hear the chainsaws in the background. This is not what you might think of as, you know, saws cutting down the Amazon; these are guys just clearing the road.   (SOUNDBITE OF CHAINSAW)  AARON SCOTT: Let's listen to the story.  KIRK SIEGLER: A storm brought massive wind, toppling trees, and huge rain all at once, which is unusual. So is what preceded it.  RITA MESQUITA: Even this year, we are experiencing a extreme drought. And there are whole areas of the Amazon right now that are completely dry and communities that are completely isolated.  KIRK SIEGLER: This is Rita Mesquita, a Brazilian government scientist and our guide at Camp 41. She's dedicated her life's work to protecting the rainforest.   (SOUNDBITE OF BIRDSONG)  KIRK SIEGLER: The Amazon is an important carbon sink. All this jungle soaks up those harmful CO2 gases that are making the planet warm. As more of it gets chopped down, that leads to more extreme weather elsewhere, like the fires in the American West and drought back here.  RITA MESQUITA: In this particular area where we are, we are right now in the middle of this huge dispute - if the forest is going to fall for cattle ranching or not - because amazingly, even though we have been here for 43 years straight, people still have not gotten the message.  AARON SCOTT: But scientists like Mesquita see October's presidential election in Brazil as a possible turning point.  RITA MESQUITA: I'm very hopeful that we're going to see change and that this change is going to be positive for the Amazon. But at the same time, I still think that we lack a concrete plan for the Amazon.  KIRK SIEGLER: You hear this a lot - until rich Western countries recognize that extreme poverty is not OK, the illegal logging and other development will continue no matter who's president. People are desperate for work.   (SOUNDBITE OF ENGINE TURNING OVER)  UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: (Non-English language spoken).  KIRK SIEGLER: This was the case until recently in an Indigenous village a day's boat ride from Manaus, along the Rio Negro River, where there are signs of change. A collection of brightly painted buildings and huts sits atop a steep riverbank.   (SOUNDBITE OF DOG BARKING)  KIRK SIEGLER: Roberto Brito Mendoncza says he's a fourth-generation logger but lately realized that what's going on in these forests is a direct threat to his people's survival.  ROBERTO BRITO MENDONCZA: (Non-English language spoken).  KIRK SIEGLER: ""My grandparents knew basically everything about the seasons,"" he says. ""Today, we can't predict anything."" Summers are 10 degrees hotter. It's smoky. Droughts come every couple years instead of every 30.  ROBERTO BRITO MENDONCZA: (Non-English language spoken).  KIRK SIEGLER: With the help of an NGO, Mendoncza stopped logging and is transforming this village into an ecotourism destination.  UNIDENTIFIED CHILD: (Non-English language spoken).  KIRK SIEGLER: The jungle surrounding it is now protected as a sustainable forest reserve, allowing for some small-scale logging and farming. Locals sell artisan products. Julia Freitas with the Foundation for Amazon Sustainability wants to replicate this model across the Amazon.  JULIA FREITAS: We believe that we cannot attack the deforestation problem if we don't give the people that live in the forest the possibility of living with a high quality of life.  KIRK SIEGLER: And there's hope that incoming President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva will be more friendly toward Indigenous rights. He's also expected to restore funding for environmental agencies that were gutted under Bolsonaro. A string of murders of Brazilian environmental enforcers in this jungle drew international headlines.   (CROSSTALK)  KIRK SIEGLER: At a reception in Manaus, I meet Carlos Travassos, who's taking over for one of the men recently killed.  CARLOS TRAVASSOS: (Non-English language spoken).  KIRK SIEGLER: ""I've been working to protect isolated Indigenous people for 14 years. It's always been risky,"" he says. Criminals felt emboldened under Bolsonaro, and enforcers like Travassos are still way outnumbered. But he won't give up.  CARLOS TRAVASSOS: (Non-English language spoken).  KIRK SIEGLER: ""Soon,"" he promises, ""there will be an army of forest guardians fighting to save the Amazon.""  AARON SCOTT: So, Kirk, as you share there, there's been a huge change in Brazil's government. We've gone from outgoing President Jair Bolsonaro, who was very pro-logging, to now the new incoming President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who has pledged a zero-tolerance policy on deforestation in the Amazon. Besides restoring funding for environmental agencies, has he laid out how he's going to go about that?  KIRK SIEGLER: I think it's still been light on specifics, and much of what you've heard so far is symbolic. But I don't want to discount that. You know, Lula showed up at COP27 in Egypt to a standing ovation. He's pledged to create a ministry for Indigenous peoples, which will be key because a lot of people in the Amazon, as that piece pointed out and many other stories before it, are sort of forced into having to cut down the trees due to the economic situation that they're in. But if he is going to restore funding for the environmental agencies, that will be big because they've been hobbled under Bolsonaro. But what the real question is - is it too late? You don't just reverse certain policies or the effects of them overnight; it's going to take time. And is there enough time to do that in the Amazon with deforestation? That's what nobody knows for sure.  AARON SCOTT: I'm curious. What was morale like amongst the scientists at the research station? What keeps them going?  KIRK SIEGLER: I was actually surprised. There was quite a bit of hope and also excitement and enthusiasm. We met a lot of graduate students and other younger researchers who come out to the camp who are doing their doctoral work there, most of them Brazilian. Many of them have never actually seen the Amazon until coming to Camp 41. Most of Brazil's population is urban, and most Brazilians do not get to visit the Amazon. So there was a sense of excitement about what's still being discovered in that jungle but also some optimism that things may be turning around with the change in presidential administrations.  But I think a lot of scientists on the front lines of climate change will probably tell you they have to remain optimistic because they're presented with a bunch of doom-and-gloom data all day, every day, every month of every year. But they're really on the front lines there at Camp 41 and other research facilities in Brazil like that, and I think that there is some optimism that it is not too late, that they could still - with more and more global attention coming to the poverty issue, for example, in the Brazilian Amazon, with more pressure from the international community about some of the agricultural exports out of Brazil, some of them may be tied to deforestation. I think there's going to be more international pressure, and I think some of the scientists' optimism that we spoke to is a result of seeing that there's more international awareness and attention to this increasingly global problem.   (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)  AARON SCOTT: Well, thank you so much, Kirk, for sharing this with us.  KIRK SIEGLER: For sure. Glad to be here.

2022-10-07,"Under Bolsonaro, Amazon deforestation hits new September record",530,"Oct 07, 2022( Al Jazeera English: https://www.aljazeera.com/ Delivered by Newstex)   Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon[1] has broken a record for the month of September, continuing a trend that has accelerated during the tenure of the country's far-right President Jair Bolsonaro.  About 1,455sq km (562sq miles) of rainforest were cleared in September, according to satellite data from the Brazilian space research agency INPE. That is up 48 percent from a year ago and beating the September 2019 record in a data series that began in 2015.  Average deforestation[2] in the vital ecosystem has increased by 75 percent from the previous decade since Bolsonaro took office in 2019.  The news of accelerating deforestation takes place as Brazil braces for a contentious election on October 30, where Bolsonaro will face off[3] against former left-wing president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who has promised to crack down on deforestation.  'Anyone who cares about the future of the rainforest, the lives of Indigenous peoples and the possibility of having a livable planet should vote to remove Bolsonaro,' Marcio Astrini, the executive secretary of the Climate Observatory, a coalition of environmental groups, said in a statement.  Lula won the first round last week but failed to clear the 50 percent threshold needed to avoid a run-off. Bolsonaro's surprisingly strong showing[4] in the first round, where many expected him to lose outright, has environmentalist groups feeling uneasy.  Many believe that the future of the Amazon, a vital resource in the fight against climate change, will hinge on the results of the upcoming election. About 60 percent of the Amazon is located in Brazil.  Bolsonaro, an ally of Brazil's powerful agribusiness sector, has overseen a massive depletion[5] of the rainforest as ranchers and loggers clear and set fire to wide swaths of the forest. During his first year in office in 2019, 9,178sq km (3,543sq miles) were destroyed, the worst year on record.  With three months still remaining in the year, 2022 is currently the second worst, with more than 8,590sq km (3,316sq miles) destroyed.  The Brazilian justice ministry has said that it is conducting policing operations to crack down on illegal deforestation and burning[6], the Reuters news agency reported.  But fires have surged as agribusiness interests seek to clear out space for farmland and grazing pastures. In early September, Brazil set a five-year record for the number of fires burning in the Amazon, and activists have said that under Bolsonaro enforcement has been lacklustre.  A July report by the Igarape Institute, a Brazilian think-tank, found that authorities are doing little[7] to curb deforestation in the Amazon.  The study analysed 302 environmental crime raids carried out by the federal police in the Amazon between 2016 and 2021, and found that only 2 percent targeted people illegally seizing undesignated public lands.

2022-11-10,"United Kingdom : Colombia receives support from Germany, Norway and the UK for implementing their ambitious plan to contain deforestation in the Colombian Amazon",531,"Colombias government has launched an emergency plan to stop deforestation in the Colombian Amazon. The ambitious strategy consists of working with local communities and indigenous people in 22 deforestation hotspots, reaching agreements to strengthen economic, social and environmental conditions in these areas within 100 days of starting office, Colombias Minister of Environment Susana Muhamad already signed the first agreements with communities to reduce deforestation in Caquet, the countrys second most deforested state in 2021 international partners praise the ambitious plan, and Norway and Germany will contribute 25 million USD under the Joint Declaration of Intent the sustainable use and conservation of the Amazon, the worlds largest rainforest, is considered vital to curbing catastrophic climate change and to save unique biodiversitySharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, 7 November 2022. Colombia has the third biggest forest area in South America and is known to have one of the most biodiverse forests in the world. In face of rising deforestation in the Colombian Amazon in first quarter of 2022, Colombias government has launched an ambitious emergency plan to stop deforestation in the Amazon.The Colombian Minister of Environment and Sustainable Development, Susana Muhamad, said: Colombia is committed to the development of a solid forestry economy that contributes to the goals of zero net emissions, the guarantee and protection of the applicable rights of indigenous peoples and local communities, as well as the expansion of efforts to conserve and manage sustainably natural forests. The advances in social agreements with the communities of the areas with the greatest impact of deforestation are highlighted, with the aim of promoting sustainable forest management of natural forests, the ecological restoration of degraded areas and the sustainable use of biodiversity. The plan consists of focusing efforts in 22 deforestation hotspots in the Colombian Amazon and seeks to effectively reduce deforestation in the region where more than 50% of the deforestation of the Amazon is concentrated.Through social dialogue with communities, the Colombian government aims to reach agreements to strengthen the economic, social, and environmental conditions in these areas. Within 100 days after taking office, Minister of Environment Muhamad already signed the first agreements with communities to reduce deforestation. The agreements are part of a wider strategy to develop a National Fund to mobilize finance from national and international sources, promote a Forest Economy, improve sustainable livelihoods, and stop the expansion of the agricultural frontier. Espen Barth Eide, Minister of Climate and Environment, Norway, said:I am impressed by Colombias ambitious emergency plan to stop deforestation in the Amazon. Such strong political will to protect the Amazon is essential if we are to reach the global climate goals and protect biodiversity, as well as total peace in Colombia. Norway remains a committed partner to Colombia in this effort.Norway, Germany and the United Kingdom stressed their commitment to support the impressive ambitions of Colombias government in conserving fragile ecosystems such as the Amazon rainforest, whilst also protecting local environmental and human rights leaders and safeguarding the rights and safety of indigenous peoples, campesinos and afro-Colombian communities. Based on Colombias achievements under the Joint Declaration of Intent, signed during COP25, Norway and Germany announced a donation of USD 25 million in support of Colombias plan against deforestation. Lord Goldsmith, Minister of State for Climate and Environment at the United Kingdom Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office, said: We want to speed up and grow international support for committed and ambitious forest countries like Colombia, to spur even great action at both the jurisdictional and national level. Regulating voluntary carbon markets is essential for raising the finance we need to meet our climate, nature, and development goals throughout this decade. But those markets must be high integrity from beginning to end, and we are determined to involve rural and forest communities across the board to ensure they benefit from the natural resource they protect.Jochen Flasbarth, German State Secretary in the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development, said: We will keep supporting efforts to reduce deforestation in the future. We have to ensure that our common approach evolves and meets the challenges of the climate and biodiversity crisis. We will continue our engagement in the coming years to work towards these goals together with Colombia, Norway and the UK. It is an investment in our common future.The Joint Declaration of Intent (JDI) between Colombia, Germany, Norway and the United Kingdom is a cooperative partnership and an example of international collaboration, coordination and articulation to meet the climate goals set out in the Paris Agreement. Thus far, 194 parties have signed. The JDI utilizes results-based payments for the achievement of policy goals and emission reductions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) in Colombia."
2022-11-23,US seeks to sanction criminals behind surging deforestation in Amazon rainforest,532,"The United States is planning to slap sanctions on deforestation perpetrators in the Amazon rainforest in a bid to tackle the climate crisis.  Under outgoing president Jair Bolsonaro , deforestation hit a 15-year high as the right-wing leader unwaveringly supported record levels of mining and commercial farming in the Amazon. But people behind the deforestation are set to be threatened with Magnitsky sanctions which would freeze any US assets and block all American and US companies from dealing with sanctioned individuals and businesses.  Mr Bolsonaro however has one foot out of the door and will be replaced with climate-conscious Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva who will take office from January 2023, and has already pledged to end deforestation at Cop27 earlier this month.  But a shaky history between Lula and the US raises questions on how the left-wing leader will respond to the sanctions plan. Lula has himself said that he believes the US sought to impair him politically and played a part in him being jailed.  Nevertheless, Lula’s commitment to tackling environmental catastrophe is a positive sign for the mutual desire between the US and the president-elect to bring down deforestation levels.  “Let’s fight for zero deforestation,” Lula said in his first speech as president-elect. “Brazil is ready to resume its leading role in the fight against the climate crisis , protecting all our biomes, especially the Amazon Forest. “Brazil will fight for a living Amazon; a standing tree is worth more than thousands of logs. That is why we will resume the surveillance of the entire Amazon and any illegal activity, and at the same time we will promote sustainable development.” Popularly known as the “lungs of the world”, the Amazon forest cleans the air we breathe, stores around 76 billion tonnes of carbon in total, and releases 20 billion tonnes of water into the atmosphere each day. A US official told Reuters that the process of identifying and investigating specific targets has already begun.  The US Treasury department, which is responsible for Magnitsky sanctions, declined to comment to Reuters. Neither Bolsonaro’s office nor Brazil’s Justice Ministry responded to requests for comment. Lula’s transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment."
2022-10-07,Worst September on record for Amazon deforestation,533,"Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon broke the monthly record for September, according to official figures, triggering calls from environmentalists to vote far-right President Jair Bolsonaro out of office later this month. In the latest worrying news on the rainforest, satellite monitoring showed 1,455 square kilometres of forest cover was destroyed in the Brazilian Amazon last month, according to national space agency INPE's real-time surveillance program, DETER. An area almost the size of Leitrim, and the worst for September since the program was launched in 2015. The previous record for September was also under Mr Bolsonaro: 1,454 square kilometres in 2019. The figures came as Mr Bolsonaro battles to win re-election in an 30 October runoff against leftist ex-president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who has vowed to work to achieve net-zero deforestation. Mr Lula - who also faced criticism at times for his environmental record as president - won Sunday's first-round election with 48% of the vote, to 43% for Mr Bolsonaro. Mr Bolsonaro, an ally of the powerful agribusiness sector, has faced international criticism for presiding over a surge of destruction in Brazil's 60% share of the world's biggest rainforest, a key buffer against global warming. Since he took office in January 2019, average annual deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon has increased by 75% from the previous decade. Experts say the agribusiness industry is driving the destruction by clear-cutting and burning forest to turn it to farmland and pasture. With three months to go, 2022 is already the second-worst year on record for deforestation, at 8,590 square kilometres, according to DETER. That is second only to 2019, Mr Bolsonaro's first year in office, when 9,178 square kilometres were destroyed. The second- and third-worst years were also under Mr Bolsonaro - 2020 and 2021, respectively. ""Anyone who cares about the future of the rainforest, the lives of indigenous peoples and the possibility of having a livable planet should vote to remove Bolsonaro,"" Marcio Astrini, the executive secretary of the Climate Observatory, a coalition of environmental groups, said in a statement. Mr Bolsonaro's campaign defends his record as ""balancing environmental protection with fair and sustainable economic growth."""
2022-11-04,Zero deforestation in the Amazon is now possible - here's what needs to happen,534,"Jair Bolsonaro has been defeated in the Brazilian election against Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (""Lula"") to the rejoicing of scientists, environmentalists, and human rights activists in Brazil and beyond. What happens in South America's largest country is globally significant since, among other reasons, the country contains most of the world's largest tropical forest.  Under Lula, Brazil was able to reduce deforestation in the Amazon by 84% between 2004 to 2013 and expand indigenous rights and protection. Lula promised in his acceptance speech to work toward zero deforestation in the Amazon and to protect indigenous areas from the encroachment of mining companies and other interests. Great news. Dozens of countries and hundreds of companies and financial actors have already made bold commitments to halt deforestation. For example, Unilever aims to achieve zero conversion of native ecosystems for palm oil, paper and board, tea, soy and cocoa by the end of 2023.  But, to date, such pledges have lacked any teeth in most at-risk areas. Famously, in 2014 the New York Declaration on Forests, a coalition of committed companies, countries, civil society and indigenous groups, pledged to eliminate commodity-driven deforestation by 2020. But in 2021 the group pushed back its deadline until 2030, and many deforestation activists are sceptical that this deadline will be achieved. Little progress so far Thus far, even the most ambitious and well-implemented commitments have made little progress. Research colleagues and I published in October looked at the impact of the soy moratorium, a commitment by global traders and the Brazilian industry to stop purchasing soy produced on Amazonian forest lands cleared after 2006. Brazil's huge soy industry is the second largest driver of deforestation after beef.  We found that deforestation directly for soy in the Amazon was reduced by 55% between 2006 and 2015. For many companies, this was a very useful achievement as it helped them meet their goals of not sourcing deforestation-linked soy.  Yet it did little to protect the Amazon overall since there are other drivers of deforestation and many forest areas with the potential to produce soy were not covered by the commitments. The total avoided deforestation amounted to only 1.6% of the deforestation in the Amazon and less than 1% of all of the deforestation in Brazil during the same period.  In fact, our other research published in September has shown that half of the avoided deforestation in the Amazon was offset by deforestation ""leakage"" into the Cerrado (a huge savanna region to the south and east of the Amazon) and other forest regions in Brazil.  Colleagues and I have also published research on similar commitments made by cattle companies, which are even less effective than those for soy. However, given the magnitude of cattle-driven deforestation in the Amazon, such policies at least helped to avoid another 3% of Brazilian deforestation. These deforestation reductions are meaningful. But they still leave us far from the goal of zero deforestation, which is needed to avoid potentially catastrophic tipping points in the Amazon. Three reasons for failure (so far) There are three crucial reasons why these existing pledges have failed to do more to protect the world's tropical forests. First, existing commitments cover less than 50% of forests at risk in Brazil and likely an even smaller proportion of forests in other countries.  More companies that source deforestation-risk products, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, need to adopt zero-deforestation policies. Otherwise, farmers still have ample opportunities to sell their products grown on deforested lands and avoid committed companies. Second, many of the companies that have made bold global commitments have yet to implement these policies outside of the Amazon and parts of Indonesia and face many implementation challenges to trace and monitor their products. This leaves a major portion of the world's tropical forests still at risk from agricultural expansion.  Third, deforestation can leak across areas and actors within a region. For instance, when companies crack down on deforestation in only one ecosystem for only one commodity, deforestation for that commodity may simply increase in the area next door or shift to farms growing products not covered by the policy.  This is the case for the soy moratorium in the Amazon, which led to additional deforestation in the Cerrado. It is also the case for oil palm sustainability certification programs, which reduced deforestation in targeted areas in Kalimantan, Indonesia, but caused additional clearing of rainforest elsewhere in Borneo.  ...and four reasons to be hopeful Lula's election is pivotal to filling these gaps, at least in Brazil. For instance, the new president plans to improve deforestation governance, which will make it much easier both politically and financially for companies to comply with or implement their zero-deforestation commitments. Supportive public policy may encourage more companies to commit in more regions of Brazil.  Lula also plans to significantly reduce the power of the Brazilian agricultural lobby, even if it will continue to control a large part of congress. The lobby has fought virulently against an expansion of zero deforestation efforts. The new president can also help to implement Brazil's new payment for environmental services policy framework and channel resources towards jurisdictions that work with companies to help monitor and enforce zero deforestation. Finally, Lula will be able to attract more international finance to end deforestation in Brazil, which is a necessary complement to individual companies' supply chain policies. With this momentum, zero deforestation in the Amazon may become a reality and inspire hope for other at-risk ecosystems throughout the world.
